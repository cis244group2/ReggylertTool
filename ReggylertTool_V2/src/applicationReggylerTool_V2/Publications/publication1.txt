SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
17 CFR Parts 210, 229, 230, 232, 239, 240, 249, and 270
[Release Nos. 33-11048; 34-94546; IC-34549; File No. S7-13-22]
RIN 3235-AM90
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and Projections
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rules.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is proposing rules
intended to enhance investor protections in initial public offerings by special purpose acquisition
companies (“SPACs”) and in subsequent business combination transactions between SPACs and
private operating companies. Specifically, we are proposing specialized disclosure requirements
with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts of interest, dilution,
and the fairness of these business combination transactions. The proposed new rules and
amendments to certain rules and forms under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 would address the application of disclosure, underwriter liability, and
other provisions in the context of, and specifically address concerns associated with, business
combination transactions involving SPACs as well as the scope of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Further, we are proposing a rule that would deem any business
combination transaction involving a reporting shell company, including a SPAC, to involve a
sale of securities to the reporting shell company’s shareholders and are proposing to amend a
number of financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies.
In addition, we are proposing to update our guidance regarding the use of projections in
Commission filings as well as to require additional disclosure regarding projections when used in
2
connection with business combination transactions involving SPACs. Finally, we are proposing
a new safe harbor under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that would provide that a SPAC
that satisfies the conditions of the proposed rule would not be an investment company and
therefore would not be subject to regulation under that Act.

I. INTRODUCTION
Special purpose acquisition companies first began to emerge in the 1990s as an
alternative to blank check companies regulated pursuant to Rule 419 under the Securities Act.3

In response to widespread fraud and abuse in blank check offerings, Congress passed the
Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990,4 which required the
Commission to adopt rules governing registration statements filed by blank check companies
offering penny stock.5
 In response, the Commission adopted comprehensive disclosure and
other requirements for blank check offerings in Rule 419.
6 Following the adoption of Rule 419,
securities offerings by SPACs, which are not subject to the rule’s requirements but have many
similar features, began to appear, with the number of these offerings fluctuating over the years.
7

In the past two years, however, the U.S. securities markets have experienced an unprecedented
surge in the number of initial public offerings by SPACs, with SPACs raising more than $83
billion in such offerings in 2020 and more than $160 billion in such offerings in 2021.
8
 In 2020
and 2021, more than half of all initial public offerings were conducted by SPACs.
 3
 The term “blank check company” is defined in 17 CFR 230.419(a)(2) as a development stage company that has no
specific business plan or purpose or that has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition
with an unidentified company or companies, and that is issuing “penny stock,” as defined in 17 CFR 240.3a51-1
(Exchange Act Rule 3a51-1).
4
 Pub. L. 101-429, 104 Stat. 931 (Oct. 15, 1990).
5
 Id. at sec. 508; Section 7(b) of the Securities Act.
6
 Blank Check Offerings, Release No. 33-6932 (Apr. 13, 1992) [57 FR 18037 (Apr. 28, 1992)]. Rule 419 requires a
blank check company to meet certain disclosure and investor protection requirements in registered offerings of
securities.
7
 Between 2011 and 2021, the average number of initial public offerings by SPACs registered under the Securities
Act per year was 98, with the highest number of such offerings (613) in 2021 and the lowest number of such
offerings (9) in 2012. In 2008, both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq adopted rules to permit the listing of
SPACs on these exchanges for the first time. See, e.g., Release No. 34-57785 (May 6, 2008) [73 FR 27597 (May
13, 2008)] and Release No. 34-58228 (July 25, 2008) [73 FR 44794 (July 31, 2008)].
8
 By comparison, SPACs raised a total of $13.6 billion in initial public offerings in 2019 and a total of $10.8 billion
in initial public offerings in 2018. As used in this release, “initial public offering” refers to a securities offering
9
A SPAC is typically a shell company9 that is organized for the purpose of merging with
or acquiring one or more unidentified private operating companies (a “de-SPAC transaction”)
within a certain time frame (often two years) and that conducts a firm commitment underwritten
initial public offering of $5 million or more in units consisting of redeemable shares and
warrants.
10 A SPAC is organized and managed by its sponsor, which is usually compensated
through an amount equal to a percentage (often 25 percent) of the SPAC’s initial public offering
proceeds (in the form of discounted shares and warrants) to be received upon the completion of a
de-SPAC transaction.11 Although SPACs are not subject to the requirements of Rule 419,12 they

registered under the Securities Act by an issuer that was not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act immediately prior to the registration.
9
 The term “shell company” is defined in Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 as a registrant,
other than an asset-backed issuer, that has: (1) no or nominal operations; and (2) either: (i) no or nominal assets;
(ii) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash
equivalents and nominal other assets.
10 The descriptions included in this release of common features currently seen in SPACs and SPAC transaction
structures are based, in part, on reviews by the Commission staff of SPAC filings with the Commission. The terms
“private operating company” and “target company” are used interchangeably in this release, unless otherwise
indicated. We are proposing to define the term “target company” for purposes of the requirements applicable to
SPACs. See infra Section II.A.
11 This sponsor compensation is often referred to as the sponsor’s “promote” or “founder shares,” which usually
amounts to around 20% of the total shares of a SPAC after its initial public offering. The underwriting fees in a
SPAC’s initial public offering are typically between 5% and 5.5% of the offering proceeds, of which 3.5% is also
usually conditioned on the completion of the de-SPAC transaction.
12 Issuers that raise more than $5 million in a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering are excluded
from the definition of “blank check company” in Rule 419, and thus are not subject to the requirements of the rule,
because they are not selling “penny stock,” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3a51-1. The definition of “penny
stock” in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(51) and Rule 3a51-1 encompasses any equity security except those excluded
under the rule, such as an NMS stock, as defined in 17 CFR 242.600(b)(55), that meets certain criteria; securities
issued by a registered investment company; and securities of an issuer that has net tangible assets in excess of $2
million, or $5 million if the issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three years, or average revenue of
at least $6 million for the last three years. In 1993, the Commission issued guidance stating that issuers may
aggregate the proceeds of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering in order to exceed the $5 million
net tangible assets test in Rule 3a51-1(g)(1). See Penny Stock Definition for Purposes of Blank Check Rule, Release
No. 33-7024 (Oct. 25, 1993) [58 FR 58099 (Oct. 29, 1993)]. SPACs often have provisions in their governing
instruments that prohibit them from being “penny stock” issuers. As used in this release, the term “SPAC” excludes
those issuers that are subject to Rule 419. In Dec. 2020, the Commission received a rulemaking petition
(“Rulemaking Petition”) requesting that the Commission adopt rule amendments to permit SPACs to conduct initial
public offerings on a best-efforts basis without being subject to Rule 419. See Rulemaking Petition from Loeb &
Loeb LLP, File No. 4-768 (Dec. 21, 2020), available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2020/petn4-768.pdf.
As of the date of this release, we have not received any comment letters in response to the Rulemaking Petition.

are typically structured to operate under similar, though usually less stringent, conditions in order
to attract investors and to comply with exchange listing requirements.
13
Following its initial public offering, a SPAC generally places all or substantially all of the
offering proceeds into a trust or escrow account,14 and the SPAC’s shares and warrants are
typically registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and then begin trading on a national
securities exchange.15 If a SPAC does not complete a de-SPAC transaction within the time
frame specified in its governing instruments, the SPAC may seek an extension of the time frame
from its shareholders or may dissolve and liquidate, with the sponsor not earning the “promote”
and the assets held in the trust or escrow account returned on a pro rata basis to its
shareholders.16
If, on the other hand, a SPAC identifies a candidate for a business combination
transaction, the shareholders of the SPAC have the opportunity to either: (1) redeem their shares
prior to the business combination and receive a pro rata amount of the initial public offering
 13 These conditions are generally market driven, and are typically set forth in their governing instruments and/or
contractual arrangements, or are pursuant to the laws of the state or country of organization or the listing standards
of national securities exchanges. See, e.g., NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 102.06 and Nasdaq Listing Rule
IM-5101-2. For example, Section 102.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires, among other things, that
at least 90% of the initial public offering proceeds, together with the proceeds of any other concurrent sales of equity
securities, be held in a trust account controlled by an independent custodian until the consummation of a business
combination with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust, with the time period to
consummate the de-SPAC transaction not to exceed three years. In contrast, under Rule 419, a blank check
company must, among other things, complete a merger or acquisition within 18 months after the effective date of its
registration statement and must place the offering proceeds and the securities sold in the offering in an escrow or
trust account until the completion of the merger or acquisition, which precludes trading in the blank check
company’s securities until after the merger or acquisition is completed.
14 The assets in the trust or escrow account are typically invested in U.S. government securities and money market
funds that invest in U.S. government securities. See infra Section VI.
15 The shares and warrants usually begin trading as a unit, with a unit frequently consisting of a common share and
a fraction of a warrant, and are traded separately after a certain period. The warrants often become exercisable one
year after the SPAC’s initial public offering or upon the completion of a de-SPAC transaction.
16 Exchange rules require a listed SPAC to complete a de-SPAC transaction within a specified timeframe not to
exceed 36 months after its initial public offering. See, e.g., NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 102.06.and
Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.
11
proceeds held in the trust or escrow account, or (2) remain a shareholder of the company after the
business combination.17 To offset shareholder redemptions and to fund larger de-SPAC
transactions, SPACs often conduct additional private capital-raising transactions, typically in the
form of private investment in public equity (PIPE) transactions.18 De-SPAC transactions often
result in the former SPAC’s shareholders owning a minority interest in the post-business
combination company, with the former private operating company’s shareholders and PIPE
investors owning a majority interest in the post-business combination company following these
transactions.19
Shareholder approval is often required in de-SPAC transactions, and, in such cases, a
SPAC provides its shareholders with a proxy statement on Schedule 14A, or an information
statement on Schedule 14C if it is not soliciting proxies from its shareholders.20 If a SPAC or
the target company is registering an offering of its securities (or the securities of a new holding
company) to be issued in the de-SPAC transaction, then a registration statement on Form S-4 or
 17 According to a study of SPAC initial public offerings between 2010 and 2018, an average of 54.4% and a median
of 57.1% of shares issued in an initial public offering by a SPAC during this period were redeemed prior to the
completion of a de-SPAC transaction. Usha R. Rodrigues and Michael Stegemoller, SPACs: Insider IPOs (SSRN
Working Paper, 2021). Another analysis found that, between July 1, 2021 and Dec. 1, 2021, mean and median
SPAC redemption rates were 55% and 66%, respectively. Michael Klausner, Michael Ohlrogge, and Emily Ruan, A
Sober Look at SPACs, 39 YALE J. ON REGUL. 228 (2022). See infra Section IX.C.1.a.4. for a discussion of
shareholder redemptions based on analysis by the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA) of available
data.
18 The parties to a de-SPAC transaction often negotiate a minimum cash condition pursuant to which a SPAC must
have a specified minimum amount of cash at the closing of the de-SPAC transaction, which could include funds in
the trust or escrow account, the proceeds from PIPE transactions, and other sources. When a SPAC conducts a PIPE
transaction in connection with a de-SPAC transaction, the post-business combination company generally files a
Securities Act registration statement following the de-SPAC transaction to register the resale of the securities
purchased in the PIPE transaction.
19 According to one study, of the 47 SPAC mergers that occurred between Jan. 2019 and June 2020, SPAC
shareholders, including the sponsor, held a median of 35% of the merged company after a de-SPAC transaction (of
which the sponsor held a median of 12% of the merged company), with the remaining 65% of the merged company
held by other parties including the target company’s shareholders and PIPE investors. Klausner, Ohlrogge, and
Ruan, supra note 17.
20 17 CFR 240.14a-2 (Exchange Act Rule 14a-2) and 17 CFR 240.14c-2 (Exchange Act Rule 14c-2).
12
F-4 would be filed for the securities offering. If no registration statement or proxy or
information statement is required, then the SPAC disseminates a tender offer statement
(Schedule TO) for the redemption offer to its security holders with information about the target
company.
21 Regardless of how the de-SPAC transaction is structured, the operations of the
private company are conducted by the post-business combination company following the
consummation of a de-SPAC transaction, with the shareholders of the private company now
owning shares in a publicly listed company.
De-SPAC transactions can be viewed as a way for private operating companies to
become public reporting companies under the Exchange Act and obtain a listing on a national
securities exchange while avoiding certain of the safeguards for investors and conventions of the
typical initial public offering process.22 From the perspective of the shareholders and
management of a private operating company, some of the purported advantages of combining
with a SPAC compared to conducting an underwritten initial public offering could include:
greater pricing certainty in merger negotiations; a relatively shorter time frame in becoming a
 21 The Commission has promulgated rules under the Exchange Act setting forth filing, disclosure, and
dissemination requirements in connection with tender offers. See, e.g., Regulations 14D and 14E and Exchange Act
Rule 13e-4. When an issuer conducts a tender offer, the issuer may be required to file and disseminate a
Schedule TO pursuant to Rule 13e-4. The redemption rights in a SPAC context generally have indicia of being a
tender offer, such as a limited period of time for the SPAC security holders to request redemption of their securities.
The Commission staff, however, has not insisted that SPACs comply with the tender offer rules when a SPAC files a
Schedule 14A or 14C in connection with the approval of a de-SPAC transaction or an extension of the timeframe to
complete a de-SPAC transaction and conducts the solicitation in accordance with Regulation 14A or 14C, as the
federal proxy rules mandate substantially similar disclosures and applicable procedural protections as required by
the tender offer rules. However, this staff position does not apply when a SPAC does not file a Schedule 14A or
14C in connection with the de-SPAC transaction or an extension. SPACs that do not file a Schedule 14A or 14C,
such as SPACs that are foreign private issuers, have generally filed and disseminated Schedules TO for the
redemptions of their securities and complied with the procedural requirements of the tender offer rules. In these
circumstances, the staff has taken the position that the Schedule TO should include the same financial and other
information as is required in Schedule 14A or 14C for a de-SPAC transaction. See infra Section II.F.4 for a
discussion of proposed Item 1608 of Regulation S-K and Section IV.A. for a discussion of proposed Rule 145a
under the Securities Act, which would affect when a SPAC may be required to file a Form S-4 or F-4 in connection
with a de-SPAC transaction.

public company; and the perceived freedom to use projections in connection with de-SPAC
transactions, with reduced liability exposure.23 De-SPAC transactions also offer private
operating companies an infusion of capital from the SPAC,24 as well as potentially greater share
liquidity for the post-business combination company based on the existing trading market for the
SPAC’s securities.25
Although the basic structure of SPACs has existed since the 1990s, the recent surge in
SPAC offerings and the increasing use of de-SPAC transactions as a mechanism for private
operating companies to access the U.S. public securities markets have caused some market
observers to express concerns about various aspects of the SPAC structure.
26 For example, some
commentators have raised concerns regarding the amount of sponsor compensation and other
costs and their dilutive effects on a SPAC’s shareholders.27 A number of commentators have
also pointed to the nature of the sponsor compensation (i.e., dependent on the completion of a
de-SPAC transaction) as a potential conflict of interest in the SPAC structure that could lead
sponsors to enter into de-SPAC transactions that are unfavorable to unaffiliated shareholders of

Gahng, Jay R. Ritter, and Donghang Zhang, SPACs (SSRN Working Paper, 2021).
24 Typically, much of this cash comes from PIPE investors around the time of the de-SPAC transaction and not
from investors in the SPAC’s initial public offering. See, e.g., Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17.
25 However, one study found evidence of illiquidity in SPAC shares, with relatively thin trading volume particularly
during the period before the announcement of a proposed de-SPAC transaction. Rodrigues and Stegemoller, supra
note 17.
26 For example, in May 2021, the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets of
the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on “Going Public: SPACs, Direct Listings, Public Offerings,
and the Need for Investor Protections,” which included testimony on, among other things, misaligned incentives in
the SPAC structure, disclosure issues with respect to SPACs, and the use of projections in de-SPAC transactions. A
webcast of the hearing is available at: https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407753.

the SPACs without performing robust due diligence in connection with these transactions, when
the alternative is to liquidate the SPACs and return the initial public offering proceeds to the
shareholders.28 Other commentators have criticized stock exchange listing rules under which
SPAC shareholders have voted in favor of proposed de-SPAC transactions while still redeeming
their shares prior to the closing of the transactions.29 A number of studies have found that
returns are relatively poor for investors in companies following a de-SPAC transaction.30
In addition, some commentators have expressed concerns regarding the adequacy of the
disclosures provided to investors in these transactions in terms of explaining the potential
benefits, risks and effects for investors, as well as the potential benefits for the sponsor and other
affiliates of the SPAC.
31 One of these commentators also expressed the view that the disclosure

shareholder vote on a business combination is held, the public shareholders voting against a business combination
have a right to redeem shares. See, e.g., Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2 (stating, in part, that “public Shareholders
voting against a business combination must have the right to convert their shares of common stock into a pro rata
share of the aggregate amount then in the deposit account (net of taxes payable and amounts distributed to
management for working capital purposes) if the business combination is approved and consummated”).

private operating company that are allegedly incomplete, inaccurate, and materially misleading. See, e.g., In the
15
about the private operating company provided through the de-SPAC transaction process may be
less complete and less reliable than that provided by an issuer in a traditional initial public
offering.32 Other commentators have criticized the use of projections in de-SPAC transactions
that, in their view, have appeared to be unreasonable, unfounded or potentially misleading,
particularly where the target company is an early stage company with no or limited sales,
products, and/or operations,
33 as well as the lack of a named underwriter in these transactions
that would typically perform traditional gatekeeping functions, such as due diligence, and would
be subject to liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act for untrue statements of material
facts or omissions of material facts.
34 In response to a number of these and other issues, the
Commission staff has provided guidance relating to SPACs on five occasions since December

In September 2021, the Commission’s Investor Advisory Committee36 issued preliminary
recommendations regarding SPACs and expressed concerns about whether sponsors and target
companies have engaged in regulatory arbitrage by using de-SPAC transactions as a path to the
public markets. In addition, the Investor Advisory Committee expressed concerns about
potential conflicts of interest between sponsors and retail investors, and the effectiveness of the
disclosures provided in these transactions.37 Among other things, the Investor Advisory
Committee recommended that the Commission “regulate SPACs more intensely” through an
enhanced focus on and stricter enforcement of existing disclosure rules in areas such the
sponsor’s role in a SPAC, the process and risks in identifying and assessing target companies,
PIPE financing terms, and de-SPAC transaction due diligence, as well as application of the Plain
English disclosure rules.38 The Investor Advisory Committee also recommended that the
Commission prepare and publish a report analyzing the parties involved in SPAC transactions at
various stages and the compensation and incentives of these parties.

36 The Investor Advisory Committee was established by Section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), to advise and consult with
the Commission on regulatory priorities, issues, and initiatives.
37 See Recommendations of the Investor Advisory Committee Regarding Special Purpose Acquisition Companies
(Sept. 9, 2021) (“IAC Recommendations”), available at: https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisorycommittee-2012/20210909-spac-recommendation.pdf. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Investor Advisory
Committee to submit findings and recommendations for review and consideration by the Commission. The
Commission then issues a public statement assessing the finding or recommendation and disclosing the
Commission’s intended action, if any, in regard to the finding or recommendation. See Section 911(g) of the DoddFrank Act.
38 17 CFR 230.421(d) (Securities Act Rule 421(d)) requires registrants to write the prospectus cover page,

short sentences; definite, concrete, everyday language; active voice; tabular presentation of complex information
whenever possible; no legal or business jargon; and no multiple negatives. Plain English Disclosure, Release No.

17
Also in September 2021, the Commission’s Small Business Capital Formation Advisory
Committee39 held a panel discussion on initial public offerings, direct listings, and SPACs.40
The panelists expressed their views on a range of topics related to SPACs, including the factors
behind the significant growth of the SPAC market over the past two years, the potential benefits
of SPACs to the public markets, the potential benefits of enhanced disclosure requirements
applicable to SPACs, and perceived issues surrounding the use of projections in de-SPAC
transactions. The panel discussion also addressed the costs embedded in the SPAC structure and
the dilutive effects of these costs on non-redeeming shareholders, as well as the poor marketadjusted returns of companies, on average, following de-SPAC transactions.41
Having considered these and other perspectives on the SPAC market, we are of the view
that greater transparency and more robust investor protections could assist investors in evaluating
and making investment, voting, and redemption decisions with respect to these transactions.
Accordingly, we are proposing new rules and rule amendments to enhance existing disclosure
requirements and investor protections in initial public offerings by SPACs and in de-SPAC
transactions. A number of the rules and amendments we are proposing are intended to improve
the usefulness and clarity of the information provided to investors so that they can make better
informed decisions as to whether to purchase securities in SPAC initial public offerings, to
purchase or sell SPAC securities in secondary trading markets, and in voting, investment and
redemption decisions in connection with de-SPAC transactions.

39 The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee was established by Section 2 of the SEC Small
Business Advocate Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-284, 130 Stat. 1447 (2016), to provide advice to the Commission on
the Commission’s rules, regulations, and policies relating to (1) capital raising by emerging, privately held small
businesses and public companies with less than $250 million in public market capitalization; (2) trading in their
securities; and (3) public reporting and corporate governance requirements applicable to these companies.
40 The panelists were Isabelle Freidheim, Michael Klausner, David Ni, and Phyllis Newhouse.
41 See Transcript of SEC Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee (Sept. 27, 2021), available at:
https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/sbcfac-transcript-092721.pdf.

The proposed rules and amendments, if adopted, could help the SPAC market function
more efficiently by improving the relevance, completeness, clarity, and comparability of the
disclosures provided by SPACs at the initial public offering and de-SPAC transaction stages, and
by providing important investor protections to strengthen investor confidence in this market. In
developing these proposals, we have considered the recommendations and views discussed
above, as well as the Commission staff’s experience in reviewing disclosures in SPAC initial
public offerings and de-SPAC transactions.
Specifically, we are proposing to add new Subpart 1600 of Regulation S-K that would set
forth specialized disclosure requirements in connection with initial public offerings by SPACs
and in connection with de-SPAC transactions. In new Subpart 1600, we are proposing to, among
other things:
• Require additional disclosures about the sponsor of the SPAC, potential conflicts of
interest, and dilution;
• Require additional disclosures on de-SPAC transactions, including a requirement that
the SPAC state (1) whether it reasonably believes that the de-SPAC transaction and
any related financing transaction are fair or unfair to investors, and (2) whether it has
received any outside report, opinion, or appraisal relating to the fairness of the
transaction; and
• Require certain disclosures on the prospectus cover page and in the prospectus
summary of registration statements filed in connection with SPAC initial public
offerings and de-SPAC transactions.
In addition, in view of the increasing number of private companies using de-SPAC
transactions to become publicly-traded reporting companies, we are proposing amendments to
19
provide procedural protections and to align the disclosures provided, as well as the legal
obligations of companies, in de-SPAC transactions more closely with those in traditional initial
public offerings. Specifically, we are proposing to:
• Amend the registration statement forms and schedules filed in connection with deSPAC transactions to require additional disclosures about the private operating
company;
• Require that disclosure documents in de-SPAC transactions be disseminated to
investors at least 20 calendar days in advance of a shareholder meeting or the earliest
date of action by consent, or the maximum period for disseminating such disclosure
documents permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization if such period is less than 20 calendar days;
• Deem a private operating company in a de-SPAC transaction to be a co-registrant of a
registration statement on Form S-4 or Form F-4 when a SPAC files such a registration
statement for a de-SPAC transaction, such that the private operating company and its
signing persons would be subject to liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act as
signatories to the registration statement;
• Amend the definition of smaller reporting company to require a re-determination of
smaller reporting company status following the consummation of a de-SPAC
transaction; and
• Propose a definition for “blank check company” that would encompass SPACs and
certain other blank check companies for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA)42 such that the safe harbor for forward-looking
 42 Pub. L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995).
20
statements under the PSLRA would not be available to SPACs, including with respect
to projections of target companies seeking to access the public markets through a deSPAC transaction.
Underwriters play a critical role in the securities offering process as gatekeepers to the
public markets. In light of this important role, we are proposing a new rule, Securities Act
Rule 140a, that would deem anyone who has acted as an underwriter of the securities of a SPAC
and takes steps to facilitate a de-SPAC transaction, or any related financing transaction or
otherwise participates (directly or indirectly) in the de-SPAC transaction to be engaged in a
distribution and to be an underwriter in the de-SPAC transaction. By affirming the underwriter
status of SPAC IPO underwriters in connection with de-SPAC transactions, the proposed rule
should better motivate SPAC underwriters to exercise the care necessary to ensure the accuracy
of the disclosure in these transactions by affirming that they are subject to Section 11 liability for
that information.
In addition, private companies have historically used shell companies with Exchange Act
reporting obligations in various forms of transactions, including SPACs, to become a public
company without undergoing a traditional initial public offering. In many cases, such shell
company shareholders may not receive a Securities Act registration statement containing
disclosures about the private company that is entering the public market for the first time. Due to
the significant increase in the use of reporting shell company business combination transactions
as a means to enter the U.S. capital markets, and in an effort to provide reporting shell company
shareholders with more consistent Securities Act protections regardless of transaction structure,
we are proposing to add new Rule 145a that would deem any business combination of a
21
reporting shell company, involving another entity that is not a shell company, to involve a sale of
securities to the reporting shell company’s shareholders.
43
Further, we are proposing new Article 15 of Regulation S-X, as well as related
amendments, to more closely align the financial statement reporting requirements in business
combinations involving a shell company and a private operating company with those in
traditional initial public offerings. This is consistent with our view that the manner in which a
company goes public should not generally result in substantially different financial statement
disclosures being provided to investors.
We are also proposing amendments intended to enhance the reliability of projections
disclosure in Commission filings, as well as additional requirements when projections are
disclosed in connection with de-SPAC transactions. The proposed amendments to Item 10(b) of
Regulation S-K would address broader concerns regarding the use of projections generally, while
proposed Item 1609 of Regulation S-K would address concerns specific to de-SPAC
transactions.
Finally, as the SPAC market has grown dramatically in recent years, some SPACs have
sought to operate in novel ways that suggest a need for SPACs and their sponsors to increase
 43 Throughout this release, we use “shell company” in lieu of the phrase “shell company, other than a business
combination related shell company.” The term “business combination related shell company” is defined in
Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 as a shell company that is: “(1) Formed by an entity that is
not a shell company solely for the purpose of changing the corporate domicile of that entity solely within the United
States; or (2) Formed by an entity that is not a shell company solely for the purpose of completing a business
combination transaction (as defined in 17 CFR 230.165(f)) among one or more entities other than the shell company,
none of which is a shell company.” For purposes of proposed Rule 145a (see infra Section IV.A.), the term
“reporting shell company” is defined as a company, other than an asset-backed issuer as defined in Item 1101(b) of
Regulation AB, that has: (1) no or nominal operations; (2) either: (i) no or nominal assets; (ii) assets consisting
solely of cash and cash equivalents; or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and
nominal other assets; and (3) an obligation to file reports under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
We similarly use “reporting shell company” in lieu of the phrase “reporting shell company, other than a business
combination related shell company” throughout this release.
22
their focus on evaluating when a SPAC could be an investment company and thus subject to the
requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”).44 We
are concerned that SPACs may fail to recognize when their activities raise the investor protection
concerns addressed by the Investment Company Act. To assist SPACS in focusing on, and
appreciating, when they may be subject to investment company regulation, we are proposing a
new safe harbor under the Investment Company Act. The proposed rule would provide a safe
harbor from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment
Company Act for SPACs that satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration, asset
composition, business purpose and activities.45
We welcome feedback and encourage interested parties to submit comments on any or all
aspects of the proposed new rules and amendments. When commenting, it would be most
helpful if you include the reasoning behind your position or recommendation.
II. PROPOSED NEW SUBPART 1600 OF REGULATION S-K
We are proposing to add new Subpart 1600 to Regulation S-K to set forth specialized
disclosure requirements applicable to SPACs regarding the sponsor, potential conflicts of
interest, and dilution, and to require certain disclosures on the prospectus cover page and in the
prospectus summary.
46 Proposed Subpart 1600 would also require enhanced disclosure for deSPAC transactions, including a fairness determination requirement. We are proposing to amend
a number of forms and schedules used by SPACs for initial public offerings and de-SPAC
 44 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.
45 See infra Section VI for a discussion of proposed Rule 3a-10.
46 The proposed requirements in new Subpart 1600 would, to an extent, codify and standardize some of the
disclosures already commonly provided by SPACs.
23
transactions to require the information set forth in proposed Subpart 1600.
47 To the extent that
the disclosure requirements in proposed Subpart 1600 address the same subject matter as the
existing disclosure requirements of the forms or schedules, the requirements of proposed Subpart
1600 would be controlling.48 The following table summarizes the proposed items in Subpart
1600, as described more fully below:49

 47 See the proposed amendments to Forms S-1, F-1, S-4, and F-4, and Schedules 14A and TO. While we are not
proposing amendments to Schedule 14C, the disclosure contemplated by proposed Subpart 1600 would be required
in Schedule 14C pursuant to Item 1 of Schedule 14C, which states that a Schedule 14C must include the information
called for by all of the items of Schedule 14A, with limited exceptions, to the extent each item would be applicable
to any matter to be acted upon at a shareholder meeting if proxies were to be solicited in connection with the
meeting. If the securities to be issued in a de-SPAC transaction are registered on a form other than Form S-4 or F-4,
such as Form S-1 or F-1, but would be authorized to be registered on Form S-4 or F-4, the proposed requirements of
Form S-4 or F-4, as applicable, in regard to de-SPAC transactions would apply in that context.
48 Proposed General Instruction L.1. to Form S-4; Proposed General Instruction I.1. to Form F-4; Proposed Item
14(f)(1) to Schedule 14A; Proposed General Instruction K to Schedule TO. We are also proposing to re-designate
existing General Instruction K to Schedule TO as General Instruction L to the schedule.

* Proposed Item 1608 is discussed in Section II.F.4. ** Proposed Item 1609 is discussed in Section V.B.2. *** Proposed Item 1610 is discussed in Section II.G.
A. Definitions
For purposes of proposed new Subpart 1600, we are proposing Item 1601 to define the
term “special purpose acquisition company” to mean a company that has indicated that its
business plan is to (1) register a primary offering of securities that is not subject to the
25
requirements of Rule 419;
50 (2) complete a de-SPAC transaction within a specified time frame;
and (3) return all remaining proceeds from the registered offering and any concurrent offerings to
its shareholders if the company does not complete a de-SPAC transaction within the specified
time frame.
51 While the proposed definition does not include certain features common to
SPACs, such as the listing of the SPAC’s securities on a national securities exchange52 or the
issuance of redeemable securities, the proposed definition incorporates the key defining features
of the issuers that in our view should be subject to the disclosure and procedural requirements of
Subpart 1600, while remaining sufficiently broad to take into account potential variations in the
SPAC structure and the possibility that SPACs may continue to evolve. In particular, the
proposed definition would encompass issuers that would otherwise be subject to Rule 419’s
investor protection requirements but for the fact that the issuer is not issuing “penny stock.”53 At
the same time, the proposed definition does not include criteria such as listing on a national
securities exchange, certain requirements that are applicable to exchange-traded SPACs,
54 or the
issuance of redeemable securities, as these criteria would result in an overly narrow definition by
including transactional terms that have not applied to every SPAC offering in the past or that
could change as the SPAC market continues to evolve.
The term “de-SPAC transaction” would be defined as a business combination such as a
merger, consolidation, exchange of securities, acquisition of assets, or similar transaction
 50 Blank check companies subject to Rule 419 must comply with a comprehensive set of disclosure and investor
protection requirements under the rule and would not be subject to the requirements applicable to SPACs under the
proposed rules. See supra notes 6 and 13.
51 Proposed Item 1601(b).
52 In this regard, we note that the securities of SPACs were not listed on national securities exchanges until the
2000s.
53 See supra note 12.
54 See infra note 57.
26
involving a SPAC and one or more target companies (contemporaneously, in the case of more
than one target company).
55 The term “target company” would be defined as an operating
company, business, or assets.
56 As proposed, these definitions are intentionally broad and, taken
together, would encompass more typical transactions such as the acquisition of one or more
private operating companies by a SPAC, as well as less common transactions that may or may
not be permitted under exchange listing rules but for which the proposed enhanced disclosure
and procedural requirements described below may be appropriate because they raise the same
investor protection concerns.
57
The term “SPAC sponsor” would be defined as the entity and/or person(s) primarily
responsible for organizing, directing or managing the business and affairs of a SPAC, other than
in their capacities as directors or officers of the SPAC as applicable.
58 Although a sponsor of a
SPAC may perform a variety of functions within the SPAC’s structure, the proposed definition
encompasses activities that, based on the staff’s experience reviewing SPAC filings and public
 55 Proposed Item 1601(a).
56 Proposed Item 1601(d).
57 The proposed definitions would apply to both exchange-traded SPACs and SPACs traded in the over-the-counter
market. Some transactions encompassed by the proposed definitions may not be permitted under exchange listing
rules for SPACs, and nothing in this release is intended to indicate that such transactions are or should be permitted
under the exchanges’ SPACs listing rules or that exchange listing requirements should not, at a minimum, apply to
SPACs seeking an exchange listing. The Commission has consistently recognized the importance of national
securities exchange listing standards. Among other things, such listing standards help ensure that exchange-listed
companies will have sufficient public float, investor base, and trading interest to provide the depth and liquidity
necessary to promote fair and orderly markets. Furthermore, Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act requires exchange
listing rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable
principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest. The Commission has also stated that listing
standards are of significant importance to investors that may rely on the status an exchange listing ascribes to a
security. See, e.g., Release No. 34-57785 (May 6, 2008) [73 FR 27597, 27599 (May 13, 2008)] (SR-NYSE-2008-
17) (order approving initial and continued listing standards for NYSE exchange-listed SPACs).
58 Proposed Item 1601(c). In regard to natural persons, we are proposing to exclude from the scope of the definition
of “SPAC sponsor” the activities performed by natural persons in their capacities as directors and/or officers of the
SPAC to avoid overlap with existing disclosure requirements relating to directors and officers. See infra Section
II.B. for a discussion of the activities of a sponsor.

commentary, are commonly associated with sponsors of SPACs. We are proposing to define this
term broadly so that the appropriate entities or persons are subject to the proposed enhanced
disclosure requirements applicable to the sponsors of a SPAC.59
Request for Comment
1. Should we define the term “special purpose acquisition company” as proposed? Does the
proposed definition provide a workable approach to determining which issuers would be
subject to the requirements of proposed Subpart 1600? Should we define this term
differently? If so, how? For example, are there certain other common characteristics of
SPACs that should be included in the definition, such as redemption rights, exchange
listing, the placing of initial public offering proceeds in a trust or escrow account, and/or
that the de-SPAC transaction must meet a minimum fair market value (e.g., at least 80%)
of the value of the proceeds in the trust or escrow account? Should we include a
reference to “shell company” in the definition?
2. Should we define “de-SPAC transaction” as proposed? Should the scope of the proposed
definition instead be tied to de-SPAC transactions that are permitted under exchange
listing standards?60
3. Should we define the term “SPAC sponsor” as proposed? Does the proposed definition
reflect those activities commonly associated with a SPAC’s sponsor? Would the
proposed definition encompass persons or entities that are not commonly considered to
be sponsors of a SPAC? If so, how should we revise the definition to avoid scoping in
such persons or entities? In regard to natural persons, should we exclude from the scope
 59 Proposed Item 1603.
60 See supra notes 13 and 16.
28
of the definition the activities performed by natural persons in their capacities as directors
and/or officers of the SPAC, as proposed?
4. Should we define the term “target company” as proposed? Is this definition sufficiently
clear? Would this definition, in combination with the other proposed definitions, be
overly broad and encompass transactions that should not be treated as de-SPAC
transactions?
5. Are there other terms that we should define in proposed Subpart 1600? If so, which
terms and how should we define them?
6. With respect to the proposed definition of “special purpose acquisition company,” is it
clear what “has indicated that its business plan” is intended to convey? Should we
require registrants to affirmatively state in filings whether they are a special purpose
acquisition company? For example, should we amend Form S-1, Form F-1, Form S-4,
and/or Form F-4 to add to the registration statement cover page of these forms a check
box for issuers to indicate whether they are special purpose acquisition companies?
Should we also amend Schedule 14A, Schedule 14C and Schedule TO to include this
check box on the cover pages of these schedules?
B. Sponsors
The sponsor’s role is critical to the success of a SPAC. At the earliest stage, the sponsor
typically organizes and manages the SPAC, including appointing the initial directors and officers
of the SPAC, and provides the initial capital for the SPAC’s operations prior to its initial public
offering.
61 In subsequent stages, among other things, the sponsor may work with one or more
 61 See proposed Item 1601(c) for the proposed definition for “SPAC sponsor.” There is often an identity of interest
between the sponsor and the SPAC’s officers and directors, in that the same persons may work for both the sponsor
and the SPAC in different capacities. In many instances, SPACs will not hold a public election for directors until
29
investment banks in preparing for the SPAC’s initial public offering and may place the proceeds
from the offering into a trust or escrow account. Following the initial public offering, the
sponsor typically identifies potential candidates for a business combination transaction,
negotiates the transaction to acquire the target private operating company and promotes the
transaction to the SPAC’s shareholders. As discussed above, the value of the sponsor’s
compensation is usually contingent on the completion of a de-SPAC transaction.62
In view of the central role of the sponsor in a SPAC’s activities, we are proposing
Item 1603(a) to require additional disclosure about the sponsor, its affiliates and any promoters63
of the SPAC in registration statements and schedules filed in connection with SPAC registered
offerings and de-SPAC transactions, including disclosure on the following:
• The experience, material roles, and responsibilities of these parties, as well as any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (1) between the sponsor and the SPAC, its
executive officers, directors or affiliates, in determining whether to proceed with a deSPAC transaction and (2) regarding the redemption of outstanding securities;
• The controlling persons of the sponsor and any persons who have direct and indirect
material interests in the sponsor, as well as an organizational chart that shows the
relationship between the SPAC, the sponsor, and the sponsor’s affiliates;
• Tabular disclosure of the material terms of any lock-up agreements with the sponsor and
its affiliates; and
 the de-SPAC transaction or thereafter. Some SPACs provide that only the founder shares may vote in director
elections until the de-SPAC transaction.
62 See text accompanying supra notes 14-16.
63 The term “promoter” is defined in Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.
30
• The nature and amounts of all compensation that has or will be awarded to, earned by, or
paid to the sponsor, its affiliates and any promoters for all services rendered in all
capacities to the SPAC and its affiliates, as well as the nature and amounts of any
reimbursements to be paid to the sponsor, its affiliates and any promoters upon the
completion of a de-SPAC transaction.64
Proposed Item 1603(a)’s disclosure requirements are intended to provide a SPAC’s
prospective investors and existing shareholders with detailed information relating to the sponsor
that could be important in understanding and analyzing a SPAC, including how the rights and
interests of the sponsor, its affiliates, and any promoters may differ from, and may conflict with,
those of public shareholders.
65 Given that a SPAC does not conduct an operating business,
information about the background and experience of the sponsor is often important in assessing a
SPAC’s prospects for success and may be a relevant factor in the market value of a SPAC’s
securities.66 To the extent that a sponsor’s activities and arrangements with a SPAC are carried
out through, or in conjunction with, the sponsor’s affiliates and any promoters of the SPAC, we
are proposing to require corresponding disclosure with respect to these affiliates and promoters.
In addition, enhanced disclosure on the sponsor’s compensation and the sponsor’s agreements,
arrangements, or understandings may be helpful to a SPAC’s prospective investors and existing
shareholders in considering whether to acquire or redeem the SPAC’s securities, and in
 64 This would include, for example, fees and reimbursements in connection with lease, consulting, support services,
and management agreements with entities affiliated with the sponsor, as well as reimbursements for out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in performing due diligence or in identifying potential business combination candidates.
65 Proposed Item 1603(a) would operate in addition to existing disclosure requirements that may be applicable to a
SPAC’s arrangements with its sponsor such as Item 701 of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure about, among
other things, the terms of any private securities transactions between a SPAC and its sponsor within the past three
years, and Item 404 of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure about certain related party transactions.
66 See, e.g., Lin, Lu, Michaely, and Qin, supra note 30; Andrea Pawliczek, A. Nicole Skinner, and Sarah L.C.
Zechman, Signing Blank Checks: The Roles of Reputation and Disclosure in the Face of Limited Information (SSRN
Working Paper, 2021).
31
evaluating the potential risks and merits of a proposed de-SPAC transaction because it could
highlight additional motivations for completing a de-SPAC transaction.
While proposed Item 1603 calls for detailed disclosure about the sponsor, its experience
and its rights and interests, we note that some of this information is already being provided, to an
extent, by SPACs. Codifying and amplifying these existing disclosure practices would help
ensure that issuers provide consistent and comprehensive information across transactions, so that
investors can make more informed investment, voting and redemption decisions.
Request for Comment
7. Should we require additional information regarding sponsors of SPACs pursuant to
Item 1603(a), as proposed? If so, should we also require disclosure regarding the
sponsor’s affiliates and any promoters of the SPAC, as proposed?
8. Should we require disclosure about the experience and material roles and responsibilities
of the sponsor, its affiliates and any promoters of the SPAC in directing and managing
the SPAC’s activities, as proposed? How would investors use this information?
9. Should we require more or less information about the sponsor’s compensation and
reimbursements? Should we require this disclosure only when the amounts exceed a de
minimis threshold? If so, what should the de minimis threshold be?
10. Should we require additional disclosure about the sponsor’s agreements, arrangements, or
understandings in determining whether to proceed with a de-SPAC transaction and
regarding the redemption of outstanding securities of the SPAC, as proposed?
11. Should we require disclosure about the controlling persons of the sponsor and any
persons who have direct and indirect material interests in the sponsor, as proposed?
Should we take a different approach than requiring disclosure on persons with “material
32
interests” in the sponsor? Should we consider requiring additional disclosure on the
controlling persons of entities that own or control the sponsor? Should we require an
organizational chart that shows the relationship among the SPAC, the sponsor, and the
sponsor’s affiliates, as proposed? Would both narrative disclosure and an organizational
chart be helpful to investors?
12. Should we require disclosure of the material terms of any lock-up agreements with the
sponsor and its affiliates as proposed? Would the proposed requirement to provide this
disclosure in a tabular format be helpful to investors? Should we instead require this
disclosure in a non-tabular format?
13. Is there additional information regarding sponsors that should be disclosed? Should we
require more or less information about the sponsor depending on the size or other
characteristics of a SPAC?
14. Should additional disclosure be required regarding affiliated entities involved in the
SPAC’s operations?
C. Conflicts of Interest
Within a SPAC’s structure, there may be a number of potential or actual conflicts of
interest between the sponsor and public investors that could influence the actions of the SPAC.
A notable example is the potential conflict of interest stemming from the contingent nature of the
sponsor’s compensation, whereby the sponsor and its affiliates have significant financial
incentives to pursue a business combination transaction even though the transaction could result
in lower returns for public shareholders than liquidation of the SPAC or an alternative
33
transaction.
67 Other conflicts of interest may arise when a sponsor is a sponsor of multiple
SPACs and manages several different SPACs at the same time; when a sponsor and/or its
affiliates hold financial interests in, or have contractual obligations to, other entities; or when a
SPAC enters into a business combination with a private operating company affiliated with the
sponsor, the SPAC, or the SPAC’s founders, officers, or directors. Further, a SPAC’s officers
often do not work full-time at the SPAC, may work for both the sponsor and the SPAC, and/or
may have responsibilities at other companies, which may impact such officers’ ability to devote
adequate time and attention to the activities of the SPAC and may influence their decision to
proceed with a particular de-SPAC transaction. These potential conflicts of interest could be
particularly relevant for investors to the extent that they arise when a SPAC and its sponsor are
evaluating and deciding whether to recommend a business combination transaction to
shareholders, especially as the SPAC nears the end of the period to complete such a transaction
under, e.g., its governing instruments or the proposed safe harbor under the Investment Company
Act,68 if adopted, and the sponsor may be under pressure to find a target and complete the deSPAC transaction on less favorable terms or face losing the value of its securities in the SPAC.
We are proposing Item 1603(b) to require disclosure of any actual or potential material
conflict of interest between (1) the sponsor or its affiliates or the SPAC’s officers, directors, or
promoters, and (2) unaffiliated security holders. This would include any conflict of interest in
determining whether to proceed with a de-SPAC transaction and any conflict of interest arising
from the manner in which a SPAC compensates the sponsor or the SPAC’s executive officers
and directors, or the manner in which the sponsor compensates its own executive officers and
 67 See, e.g., Usha Rodrigues and Mike Stegemoller, Exit, Voice, and Reputation: The Evolution of SPACs, 37 DEL.
J. CORP. L. 849 (2013).
68 See infra Section VI.
34
directors. In addition, we are proposing Item 1603(c) to require disclosure regarding the
fiduciary duties each officer and director of a SPAC owes to other companies. Such disclosure
could allow investors to assess whether and to what extent officers or directors may have to
navigate a conflict of interest consistent with their obligations under the laws of the jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization, may be compelled to act in the interest of another company or
companies that compete with the SPAC for business combination opportunities, or may have
their attention divided such that it may affect their decision-making with respect to the SPAC.
The proposed disclosure requirements would provide a SPAC’s shareholders and
prospective investors with a more complete understanding of any actual or potential material
conflicts of interest associated with the SPAC and the benefits that may be realized by the
sponsor and its affiliates and any promoters arising from these conflicts of interest. Such
disclosure could allow investors to more accurately assess the potential risk associated with the
conflicts of interest in a SPAC. Further, disclosure about the fiduciary duties a SPAC’s officers
and directors owe to other companies could allow the SPAC’s shareholders and prospective
investors to better assess the actions of these officers and directors in managing the SPAC’s
activities and in determining to proceed with a proposed de-SPAC transaction.
Request for Comment
15. Should we require disclosure with respect to material conflicts of interest that may arise
in connection with de-SPAC transactions, as proposed? Should we include a materiality
threshold, as proposed? Is it clear what would constitute an actual or potential material
conflict of interest, or is further guidance or specification needed? For example, are there
other specific conflicts of interest that we should identify in the rule?
35
16. Would the proposed disclosure requirements adequately inform investors as to potential
material conflicts of interest? Are there approaches that could minimize potential
boilerplate or duplicative disclosure? Should we require that this disclosure be presented
in a tabular format?
17. Is there any additional information that we should require regarding conflicts of interest?
For example, should we also require a description of any policies and procedures used or
to be used to minimize potential or actual conflicts of interest? Should we require
disclosure of how the board of directors assesses and manages such conflicts, in
particular where directors themselves have conflicts of interest?
18. Should SPACs be required to provide additional disclosure regarding material conflicts
of interest in Exchange Act reports following their initial public offerings? For example,
should periodic reports require that any changes in previously disclosed conflicts of
interest be reported? Should we require disclosure about material conflicts of interest
relating to both the SPAC and the identified target company in the Form 8-K that is
required to be filed in connection with the announcement of a de-SPAC transaction?
19. Should we require disclosure about any fiduciary duties each officer and director of a
SPAC owes to other companies, as proposed? How would investors use this
information? Should we require additional or different disclosure regarding these
fiduciary duties? Would this requirement potentially result in the disclosure of
information that is not relevant to SPAC investors? Should this disclosure requirement
be focused instead on material conflicts of interests arising from these fiduciary duties to
other companies? Should we require that this disclosure be provided in a tabular format?
Should we consider other approaches to this disclosure?
36
D. Dilution
We are proposing Items 1602(a)(4), 1602(c) and 1604(c) to require additional disclosure
about the potential for dilution in (1) registration statements filed by SPACs, including those for
initial public offerings, and (2) de-SPAC transactions. Proposed Item 1602(c) would be
applicable to all registered offerings by a SPAC other than a de-SPAC transaction, while
proposed Item 1604(c) would be applicable to all de-SPAC transactions. We are also proposing
Item 1602(a)(4) to require simplified tabular dilution disclosure on the prospectus cover page in
registered offerings by a SPAC on Form S-1 or F-1 other than for de-SPAC transactions.
There are a number of potential sources of dilution in a SPAC’s structure, including
dilution resulting from shareholder redemptions, sponsor compensation, underwriting fees,
outstanding warrants and convertible securities, and PIPE financings. This dilution may be
particularly pronounced for the shareholders of a SPAC who do not redeem their shares prior to
the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction and who may not realize or appreciate that these
costs are disproportionately borne by the non-redeeming shareholders.
69 According to one study,
the median dilutive impact of sponsor compensation, underwriting fees, warrants, and rights
equaled 50.4% of the cash raised in a SPAC initial public offering.70 Further, several
commentators have asserted that the complexity of the disclosures in these transactions makes it
difficult for investors to understand the dilutive impact of sponsor compensation on the SPAC’s
non-redeeming shareholders.71
 69 For example, the dilutive impact of underwriting fees deferred until the completion of a de-SPAC transaction and
the number of shares received by the sponsor is not required to be disclosed in a manner that takes into account the
additional dilution caused by redemptions.
70 Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17.
71 See, e.g., AFR Letter; Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17; Michael Klausner, Michael Ohlrogge, and
Harald Halbhuber, SPAC Disclosure of Net Cash Per Share (SSRN Working Paper, 2022).
37
In light of the potential for significant dilution embedded within the typical SPAC
structure, enhanced disclosure regarding dilution could enable investors in a SPAC initial public
offering and subsequent purchasers of SPAC shares to better understand the potential impact
upon them of the various dilutive events that may occur over the lifespan of the SPAC.72 We are
therefore proposing to require dilution disclosure in registration statements filed by SPACs other
than for de-SPAC transactions that would require a description of material potential sources of
future dilution following a SPAC’s initial public offering, as well as tabular disclosure of the
amount of potential future dilution from the public offering price that will be absorbed by nonredeeming SPAC shareholders, to the extent quantifiable.73 This proposed disclosure would be
in addition to the disclosure already required under Item 506 of Regulation S-K.
74
In addition, we are proposing to require simplified tabular dilution disclosure
incorporating a range of potential redemption levels on the prospectus cover page of SPAC
registration statements on Forms S-1 and F-1.
75 In providing disclosure pursuant to Item 506,
SPACs currently provide prospective investors with estimates of dilution as a function of the
 72 In this regard, we note that the initial purchasers in SPAC initial public offerings often resell or redeem their
shares prior to the completion of the de-SPAC transaction. See, e.g., Benjamin Mullin and Amrith Ramkumar,
BuzzFeed Suffers Wave of SPAC Investor Withdrawals Before Going Public, The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 2, 2021.
See also supra note 17.
73 Proposed Item 1602(c).
74 Under Item 506, a company is required to provide disclosure regarding dilution when (1) the company is not
subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and is registering an offering of common equity securities
where there is substantial disparity between the public offering price and the effective cash cost to officers, directors,
promoters, and affiliated persons of common equity acquired by them in transactions during the past five years, or
which they have the right to acquire; or (2) the company is registering an offering of common equity securities and
the company has had losses in each of its last three fiscal years and there is a material dilution of the purchasers'
equity interest. In the first instance, a company must provide a comparison of the public contribution under the
proposed public offering and the effective cash contribution of such persons. In both instances, Item 506 requires
disclosure of the net tangible book value per share before and after the distribution; the amount of the increase in
such net tangible book value per share attributable to the cash payments made by purchasers of the shares being
offered; and the amount of the immediate dilution from the public offering price which will be absorbed by such
purchasers.
75 Proposed Item 1602(a)(4).
38
difference between the initial public offering price and the pro forma net tangible book value per
share after the offering. These estimates often include an assumption that the maximum
allowable number of shares eligible will be redeemed prior to the de-SPAC transaction.76 While
this information can be useful, investors may benefit from a more detailed and prominent tabular
presentation of this dilution disclosure that shows various potential levels of redemption, not just
the upper bound on dilution attributable to redemptions. We are therefore proposing to require
that registration statements on Form S-1 or Form F-1 filed by SPACs, including for an initial
public offering, include on the prospectus cover page a simplified dilution table, in the following
format, which would present the reader with an estimate of the remaining pro forma net tangible
book value per share at quartile intervals up to the maximum redemption threshold:
Remaining Pro Forma Net Tangible Book Value per Share
Offering Price of _____ 25% of
Maximum
Redemption
50% of
Maximum
Redemption
75% of
Maximum
Redemption
Maximum
Redemption
The proposed Item 1602(a)(4) dilution disclosure would be calculated in a manner
consistent with the methodologies and assumptions more fully articulated in the disclosures
provided pursuant to Item 506 elsewhere in the prospectus. If the initial public offering includes
an overallotment option, the table would need to include separate rows showing remaining pro
forma net tangible book value per share with the exercise and without the exercise of the overallotment option. We are also proposing to require that SPACs provide a cross-reference to the
more detailed dilution disclosure later in the prospectus when providing this tabular disclosure
on the prospectus cover page.
 76 In practice, redemption rates rarely reach this level.
39
In regard to de-SPAC transactions, investors could benefit from clearer dilution
disclosure that takes into account the unique characteristics of the SPAC structure, including any
terms negotiated with the target private operating company, as well as the potential for additional
financing from PIPE investors. At the time of a de-SPAC transaction, investors are making a
decision as to whether to remain a shareholder of the post-business combination company going
forward. Apart from the operating success of the post-business combination company, dilution
is likely to have a significant impact on the value of a shareholder’s continued investment in the
company. We are therefore proposing Item 1604(c) to require disclosure of each material
potential source of additional dilution that non-redeeming shareholders may experience at
different phases of the SPAC lifecycle by electing not to redeem their shares in connection with
the de-SPAC transaction.77
For example, to the extent material, this disclosure would need to explain that, when a
SPAC’s shareholders retain their warrants after redeeming their shares prior to the de-SPAC
transaction, the non-redeeming shareholders and the post-business combination company may
face potential additional dilution. Proposed Item 1604(c)(1) would also require a sensitivity
analysis in a tabular format that shows the amount of potential dilution under a range of
reasonably likely redemption levels and quantifies the increasing impact of dilution on nonredeeming shareholders as redemptions increase. We are also proposing to require disclosure of
a description of the model, methods, assumptions, estimates, and parameters necessary to
understand the sensitivity analysis disclosure.
Request for Comment
 77 Depending on the circumstances, material potential sources of additional disclosure may include dilution from
sponsor compensation, underwriting fees, outstanding warrants and convertible securities, and financing transactions
(including PIPE transactions).

20. Should we require disclosure of material potential sources of future dilution in
registration statements filed by SPACs for initial public offerings and in disclosure
documents for de-SPAC transactions, as proposed? How would investors benefit from
this additional disclosure? Should we require other information either in addition to, or
in lieu of, the proposed dilution disclosure, such as disclosure of the cumulative amount
of dilution that non-redeeming shareholders may experience or the amount of net cash
underlying each share at the time of a de-SPAC transaction? If so, should we require that
this disclosure be presented in a tabular format? Should we provide additional
explanation on how to calculate the amount of dilution for purposes of these disclosure
requirements? Should we provide further guidance about disclosures that SPACs should
consider making to help non-affiliated shareholders understand the potential for dilution
and the consequences of dilution for non-affiliated shareholders?
21. Should we also consider requiring enhanced dilution disclosure in other Commission
filings? If so, what additional information should we require in this context? How would
investors use this additional dilution disclosure?
22. Should we require simplified tabular disclosure regarding dilution on the prospectus
cover page of a Form S-1 or Form F-1, as proposed? Should we require additional or less
information, or alternative information, in the tabular disclosure? For example, would a
tabular presentation of cash remaining per non-redeemed share in lieu of a tabular
presentation of remaining pro forma net tangible book value per share be useful to
investors? Should we consider adding a similar requirement to provide simplified tabular
disclosure (1) in the prospectus summary of a Form S-1 or F-1 or (2) on the prospectus
cover page and/or in the prospectus summary of a Form S-4 or Form F-4 for a de-SPAC
41
transaction? If so, what information should be included in such tabular disclosure? Are
there other ways to present the potential for dilution to investors in a more accessible
format?
23. Should we require, in disclosure documents for de-SPAC transactions, a sensitivity
analysis in a tabular format, as proposed? Should we consider additional or alternative
approaches to this disclosure requirement?
24. Are there any significant challenges in providing the proposed enhanced dilution
disclosure at the initial public offering stage or at the de-SPAC transaction stage?
25. Should we consider additional amendments that would highlight or simplify dilution
disclosure so that it is more clear and accessible for investors?
E. Prospectus Cover Page and Prospectus Summary Disclosure
In response to concerns raised about the complexity of disclosures in Securities Act
registration statements filed by SPACs for initial public offerings and for de-SPAC
transactions,78 we are proposing Item 1602 to require that certain information be included on the
prospectus cover page and in the prospectus summary using plain English principles.
79 Given
the unique nature of SPAC offerings and the potential risks they present to investors, investors
could benefit from requiring the issuer to highlight certain disclosures on the cover page and in
the prospectus summary, in a form that can be more easily read and understood.
 78 See, e.g., IAC Recommendations, supra note 37 (expressing concerns “relating to the effectiveness of disclosure
about the risks, economics and mechanics of SPACs as a result of the complexity of these transactions and the
staggered nature of the disclosure process”); Rodrigues Testimony; Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17.
79 See Securities Act Rule 421(d). See supra note 38.
42
1. Prospectus Cover Page
Item 501(b) of Regulation S-K sets forth disclosure requirements for the outside front
cover page of prospectuses, such as the name of the registrant, title and amount of securities
being offered, and the offering price of the securities. In regard to registered offerings (including
initial public offerings) by SPACs other than de-SPAC transactions, we are proposing
Item 1602(a) to require information on the prospectus cover page in plain English about, among
other things, the time frame for the SPAC to consummate a de-SPAC transaction, redemptions,
sponsor compensation, dilution (including simplified tabular disclosure), and conflicts of
interest. In regard to de-SPAC transactions, we are proposing Item 1604(a) to require that
SPACs include information on the prospectus cover page in plain English about, among other
things, the fairness of the de-SPAC transaction, material financing transactions, sponsor
compensation and dilution, and conflicts of interest.
Investors should benefit from having these significant aspects of SPAC offerings and deSPAC transactions disclosed prominently on the prospectus cover page in plain English,
80 in
addition to the information otherwise required under Item 501 of Regulation S-K. Although
most SPACs already provide much of the proposed information on prospectus cover pages, the
proposed rules would standardize this information across all registration statements filed by
SPACs for initial public offerings and for de-SPAC transactions.
2. Prospectus Summary
Item 503 of Regulation S-K requires a brief summary of the information in the prospectus
where the length or complexity of the prospectus makes a summary useful. While the
information that should be included in a prospectus summary will depend on the particular
 80 Id.
43
offering and issuer, a prospectus summary should provide disclosure in clear language of the
most significant aspects of the transaction being registered.81 In light of the often complex
disclosure in registration statements filed by SPACs, a requirement that SPACs present certain
information in the prospectus summary in plain English should help investors more easily to
identify and assess those aspects of the transaction that are likely to be important in their
investment, voting, and redemption decisions.
82
In regard to registered offerings other than de-SPAC transactions, we are proposing
Item 1602(b) to require that SPACs include the following information in the prospectus
summary in plain English:
• The process by which a potential business combination candidate will be identified and
evaluated;
• Whether shareholder approval is required for the de-SPAC transaction;
• The material terms of the trust or escrow account, including the amount of gross offering
proceeds that will be placed in the trust;
• The material terms of the securities being offered, including redemption rights;
• Whether the securities being offered are the same class as those held by the sponsor and
its affiliates;
• The length of the time period during which the SPAC intends to consummate a de-SPAC
transaction, and its plans if it does not do so, including, whether and how the time period
may be extended, the consequences to the sponsor of not completing an extension of this
 81 See Instruction to Item 503(a) and 17 CFR 230.421(b) (Securities Act Rule 421(b)).
82 In the context of asset-backed offerings, the Commission previously specified that certain information be
included on the prospectus cover page and in the prospectus summary. See Items 1102 and 1103 of Regulation S-K.
Asset-Backed Securities, Release No. 33-8518 (Dec. 22, 2004) [70 FR 1506 (Jan. 7, 2005)]. See also Item 3 of Form
S-4 and Item 3 of Form F-4 (specifying that certain information be included in the prospectus summary).
44
time period, and whether shareholders will have voting or redemption rights with respect
to an extension of time to consummate a de-SPAC transaction;
• Any plans to seek additional financing and how such additional financing might impact
shareholders;
• Tabular disclosure of sponsor compensation and the extent to which material dilution
may result from such compensation; and
• Material conflicts of interest.
Based on the Commission staff’s experience in reviewing registration statements filed by
SPACs, we believe these topics are among those that investors are likely to find most important
when considering an investment in the SPAC prior to the identification of a potential business
combination candidate.
In regard to registered de-SPAC transactions, we are proposing Item 1604(b) to require
that registrants include the following information in the prospectus summary in plain English:
• The background and material terms of the de-SPAC transaction;
• The fairness of the de-SPAC transaction;
• Material conflicts of interest;
• Tabular disclosure on sponsor compensation and dilution;
• Financing transactions in connection with de-SPAC transactions; and
• Redemption rights.
Based on the Commission staff’s experience in reviewing registration statements for de-SPAC
transactions, we believe investors would find this information, in particular those topics that
illuminate potential conflicts of interest and the overall fairness of the proposed transaction,
important when making an investment decision at the de-SPAC transaction stage.
45
Request for Comment
26. Would requiring certain information in regard to SPAC offerings on the prospectus cover
page and in the prospectus summary make it easier for investors to review and understand
the disclosures in these registration statements? Are there other ways we could make
these registration statements easier for investors to understand?
27. Should we require the proposed cover page disclosures for SPAC initial public offerings
and de-SPAC transactions? Is there other information that we should require to be
included on the cover page, either in addition to, or in lieu of, the information proposed to
be required? Conversely, are there any proposed additional cover page disclosures that
we should not adopt?
28. Should we require the inclusion of the proposed specified information in the prospectus
summary? Is there other information that we should require to be included in the
prospectus summary?
29. Is the subset of the disclosure under proposed Item 1605 that we are proposing to require
to be more prominently presented on the prospectus cover page and in the prospectus
summary via proposed Items 1604(a) and (b) the most informative or otherwise important
information for purposes of the prospectus cover page and the prospectus summary?
Should any additional disclosure provided pursuant to proposed Item 1605 be added to or
replace an existing element of the information proposed to be required on the prospectus
cover page or in the prospectus summary?
30. Are there other changes we should consider in regard to the prospectus cover page and
prospectus summary? For example, should we impose any additional formatting
requirements, such as the use of tables or bullet points, for certain information in the
46
prospectus summary? Would such formatting requirements improve the clarity of this
disclosure?
F. Disclosure and Procedural Requirements in De-SPAC Transactions
We are proposing specialized disclosure and procedural requirements in de-SPAC
transactions so that investors can better understand and evaluate the merits of a prospective deSPAC transaction.
83 The proposed rules would require: (1) additional disclosures on the
background of and reasons for the transaction; (2) a statement from the SPAC as to whether it
reasonably believes that the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction are fair or
unfair to unaffiliated security holders; (3) disclosure on any outside report, opinion, or appraisal
relating to the fairness of the transaction; and (4) additional information in a Schedule TO filed
in connection with a de-SPAC transaction, as well as clarify the need to comply with the
procedural requirements of the tender offer rules when filing such a Schedule TO.
84
1. Background of and Reasons for the De-SPAC Transaction; Terms and
Effects
In order to provide investors with a more complete understanding of the de-SPAC
transaction, we are proposing Item 1605 of Regulation S-K which would require disclosure of
the background, material terms, and effects of the de-SPAC transaction, including:
 83 As discussed above, a SPAC is required to provide its shareholders with a proxy statement on Schedule 14A if
shareholder approval is required in a de-SPAC transaction. If a SPAC is registering an offering of its shares to be
issued in the de-SPAC transaction, the SPAC generally files a registration statement on Form S-4 or F-4.
Alternatively, if shareholder approval is required but the SPAC is not soliciting proxies from its shareholders, the
SPAC is required to provide an information statement on Schedule 14C. Otherwise, if no registration statement,
proxy statement or information statement is required, the SPAC must disseminate a Schedule TO (tender offer
statement) to its shareholders. See Section IV.A. for a discussion of proposed Rule 145a, which would affect when a
SPAC may be required to file a Form S-4 or F-4 in connection with a de-SPAC transaction.
84 In addition, we are proposing new rules applicable to business combinations involving shell companies more
generally, which would include de-SPAC transactions. See infra Section IV.
47
• A summary of the background of the de-SPAC transaction, including, but not limited to,
a description of any contacts, negotiations, or transactions that have occurred concerning
the de-SPAC transaction;
85
• A brief description of any related financing transaction, including any payments from the
sponsor to investors in connection with the financing transaction;
• The reasons for engaging in the particular de-SPAC transaction and for the structure and
timing of the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction;
• An explanation of any material differences in the rights of security holders of the postbusiness combination company as a result of the de-SPAC transaction;86 and
• Disclosure regarding the accounting treatment and the federal income tax consequences
of the de-SPAC transaction, if material.87
These disclosure requirements are modeled, in part, on Item 1004(a)(2) and Item 1013(b)
of Regulation M-A88 and are intended to provide investors with, among other things, an
 85 For example, this disclosure could encompass whether any portion of the underwriting fees in connection with a
SPAC’s initial public offering is contingent upon the SPAC’s completion of a de-SPAC transaction and whether the
underwriter in the SPAC’s initial public offering has provided additional services to the SPAC following the initial
public offering, such as locating potential target companies, providing financial advisory services, acting as a
placement agent for PIPE transactions, and/or arranging debt financing. For a discussion of the role of the
underwriter in connection with a de-SPAC transaction, see infra Section III.F.
86 This proposed disclosure requirement is intended to address situations where the shares of a SPAC are being
exchanged for shares of a new holding company or the target company in a de-SPAC transaction.
87 Proposed Items 1605(a) and (b). This disclosure would be required in any Form S-4 or F-4 or Schedule 14A,
14C, or TO filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction. We note that registrants are already subject to similar
disclosure requirements in Schedules 14A and 14C and in Forms S-4 and F-4. These proposed disclosure
requirements are intended to complement these existing requirements by setting forth specialized disclosure
requirements that are specific to de-SPAC transactions.
88 17 CFR 229.1000 through 229.1016. Regulation M-A is a subpart (the 1000 series) of Regulation S-K.
Item 1004(a)(2) sets forth disclosure requirements regarding the material terms of mergers or similar transactions,
and Item 1013(b) requires disclosure of alternative means considered by the subject company or affiliate in the
context of a going-private transaction. In our view, these rules are appropriate models for the proposed specialized
disclosure requirements for de-SPAC transactions, in that Item 1004(a)(2) sets forth disclosure requirements for
mergers generally and the same potential for self-interested transactions exists in de-SPAC transactions as in goingprivate transactions.
48
enhanced basis upon which to evaluate a SPAC’s reasons for proposing a de-SPAC transaction
and for choosing a particular structure and financing for the transaction, through a specialized
disclosure rule tailored to SPACs that would address disclosure issues more specific to de-SPAC
transactions. These proposed requirements would also help promote consistent disclosure, which
would allow for greater comparability of these disclosures across de-SPAC transactions. As
proposed, Item 1605(b) would require a reasonably detailed discussion of the reasons for, and the
structure and timing of, a proposed de-SPAC transaction, which could include a discussion of the
key events and activities in identifying the target private operating company and in negotiating
the terms of the merger or acquisition, as well as the material factors considered by a SPAC’s
board of directors in approving the terms of the proposed de-SPAC transaction and in
recommending shareholder approval of the transaction.
In addition, we are proposing Item 1605(c) to require disclosure of the effects of the deSPAC transaction and any related financing transaction on the SPAC and its affiliates, the
sponsor and its affiliates, the private operating company and its affiliates, and unaffiliated
security holders of the SPAC. Such disclosure could allow investors to better assess whether the
transactions have been structured in a manner that would benefit one of these parties in particular
or that would be to the detriment of other parties. As proposed, the disclosure must provide a
reasonably detailed discussion of both the benefits and detriments to non-redeeming shareholders
of the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction, with such benefits and
detriments quantified to the extent practicable.
89 For example, if the sponsor’s interests and
returns may differ from those of public investors in regard to a prospective de-SPAC transaction,
the disclosure should describe and quantify, to the extent practicable, dollar amounts or
 89 Proposed Item 1605(c).
49
prospective returns the sponsor and its affiliates stand to gain or lose that are dependent on the
completion of the transaction.
We are also proposing Item 1605(d) to require disclosure of the SPAC’s sponsors’,
officers’ and directors’ material interests in the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing
transaction, including any fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and any interest
in, or affiliation with, the private operating company that is the target of the de-SPAC
transaction. This proposed disclosure requirement is intended to address, among other things,
the concern that a sponsor may be proposing a de-SPAC transaction that will produce benefits or
detriments that are not fully disclosed to investors.
90
Under Item 403 of Regulation S-K, SPACs currently provide tabular disclosure regarding
the beneficial ownership of its equity or voting securities, as applicable, by management and
beneficial owners of more than 5% of a class of voting securities.
91 The proposed disclosure
requirement in Item 1605(d) would be broader than Item 403, and would require disclosure of
any material interests that the sponsor and the SPAC’s officers and directors have in a de-SPAC
transaction or any related financing transaction, including fiduciary or contractual obligations to
other entities as well as any interest in, or affiliation with, the target company. The proposed
disclosure requirement would also encompass material interests that are non-pecuniary in nature
that may nevertheless affect the decision to proceed with a prospective de-SPAC transaction or
related financing transaction. In the context of a de-SPAC transaction, this disclosure could help
investors, when making an investment, voting or redemption decision with respect to the de-
 90 See, e.g., IAC Recommendations, supra note 37 (stating that “there may be financial arrangements that constitute
conflicts of interest that are not fully disclosed or understood by investors”); Rodrigues and Stegemoller, supra note
17; Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17; Deane Testimony.
91 Under Item 403, beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with 17 CFR 240.13d-3(d)(1) (Exchange Act
Rule 13d-3(d)(1)), pursuant to which a person is generally deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities that the
person has the right to acquire within 60 days.
50
SPAC transaction, to assess whether, on balance, the benefits of the de-SPAC transaction justify
the detriments, and particularly whether the sponsor is motivated to complete a de-SPAC
transaction by interests not held by all investors.
Proposed Item 1605(e) would require disclosure of whether or not security holders are
entitled to any redemption or appraisal rights, and if so, a summary of the redemption or
appraisal rights.92 Under the proposed rules, SPACs would be required to disclose, among other
things, whether shareholders may redeem their shares regardless of whether they vote in favor of
or against a proposed de-SPAC transaction, or abstain from voting, and whether shareholders
have the right to redeem their securities at the time of any extension of the time period to
complete a de-SPAC transaction. If there are no redemption or appraisal rights available for
security holders who object to the de-SPAC transaction, the proposed rules would require
disclosure of any other rights that may be available to security holders under the law of the
jurisdiction of organization. These disclosures would help investors better assess the impact of
any redemption or appraisal rights on a proposed de-SPAC transaction, including whether the
existence of such rights might lead some investors to redeem their securities after voting in favor
of a de-SPAC transaction.
93
 92 This proposed disclosure requirement would build upon, and be in addition to, the existing disclosure requirement
in Item 202 of Regulation S-K (Description of registrant’s securities). Under Item 202, SPACs are currently
required to disclose the redemption provisions of their capital stock being registered, such as whether redemptions
would be required under certain circumstances at the SPAC’s option, e.g., whether a SPAC may require the
redemption of warrants held by public shareholders for nominal consideration if the underlying shares trade above a
certain threshold price.
93 One commentator has observed that SPAC shareholders may vote in favor of a proposed de-SPAC transaction
while redeeming their shares prior to the closing of the transaction, such that the vote is decoupled from any
economic interest in the post-business combination company. Rodrigues and Stegemoller, supra note 17. See also
supra note 29.
51
Request for Comment
31. Would the proposed disclosure requirements provide investors with important
information regarding the background of and reasons for a de-SPAC transaction? Is there
any additional information about the background of and reasons for the de-SPAC
transaction that we should require to be disclosed? Are there any additional or alternative
requirements that we should consider to further improve the disclosures about de-SPAC
transactions?
32. Should we adopt the proposed disclosure requirements with respect to the effects of the
de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction, as proposed? Should we
require additional or alternative disclosure regarding the effects of the de-SPAC
transaction and any related financing transaction?
33. Should we require disclosure with respect to material interests in a prospective de-SPAC
transaction or any related financing transaction held by the sponsor and the SPAC’s
officers and directors, as proposed? Should we require additional or alternative
disclosure regarding the interests of these parties in the de-SPAC transaction?
34. Should we require disclosure regarding whether or not security holders are entitled to any
redemption or appraisal rights and a summary of any such rights, as proposed? Is there
additional or alternative disclosure about redemption or appraisal rights that we should
require?
35. Would the disclosure requirements in proposed Item 1605 result in duplicative
disclosures? If so, are there alternative approaches that we should consider to avoid this
result?
52
2. Fairness of the De-SPAC Transaction
To address concerns regarding potential conflicts of interest and misaligned incentives in
connection with the decision to proceed with a de-SPAC transaction and to assist investors in
assessing the fairness of a particular de-SPAC transaction to unaffiliated investors,
94 we are
proposing Item 1606(a) to require a statement from a SPAC as to whether it reasonably believes
that the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction are fair or unfair to the
SPAC’s unaffiliated security holders, as well as a discussion of the bases for this statement.
95
We are proposing to require that this statement encompass both the de-SPAC transaction and any
related financing transaction so that the fairness determination would require consideration of the
combined effects of both transactions, which are often dependent on each other, on unaffiliated
security holders. As proposed, a SPAC would be required to include this statement in any Forms
S-4 and F-4 or Schedules 14A, 14C, and TO filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction.96
Proposed Item 1606(a) would also require disclosure on whether any director voted against, or
abstained from voting on, approval of the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing
 94 See supra note 28. See also Michael Klausner and Michael Ohlrogge, SPAC Governance: In Need of Judicial
Review (SSRN Working Paper, 2021).
95 In this regard, we are proposing an instruction to Item 1606 that a “statement that the special purpose acquisition
company has no reasonable belief as to the fairness or unfairness of the de-SPAC transaction or any related
financing transaction to unaffiliated security holders will not be considered sufficient disclosure in response to [Item
1606(a)].” As proposed, a SPAC would not be required to disclose that a de-SPAC transaction and any related
financing transaction are fair but rather would be required to state its reasonable belief as to the fairness or
unfairness of the transaction as well as the bases for this statement.
96 We have modeled certain of the proposed requirements in Item 1606 and Item 1607 (see infra Section II.F.3.), on
the disclosures required in going-private transactions subject to 17 CFR 240.13e-3 (Exchange Act Rule 13e-3). See
Items 1014 and 1015 of Regulation M-A. In our view, the disclosure requirements in Rule 13e-3 provide an
appropriate model for the proposed requirements with respect to de-SPAC transactions, in that the conflicts of
interests and misaligned incentives inherent in going-private transactions are similar to those often present in deSPAC transactions.
53
transaction, and if so, identification of the director and, if known after making a reasonable
inquiry, the reasons for the vote against the transaction or abstention.
Under proposed Item 1606(b), a SPAC would be required to discuss in reasonable detail
the material factors upon which a reasonable belief regarding the fairness of a de-SPAC
transaction and any related financing transaction is based and, to the extent practicable, the
weight assigned to each factor. These factors would include but not be limited to: the valuation
of the private operating company; the consideration of any financial projections; any report,
opinion, or appraisal obtained from a third party; and the dilutive effects of the de-SPAC
transaction and any related financing transaction on non-redeeming shareholders. Together,
these proposed disclosures are intended to help investors assess the reasonableness of the
SPAC’s stated belief about the fairness of the transaction.
To provide additional context for understanding the process by which a SPAC
determined to proceed with a de-SPAC transaction, we are proposing Items 1606(c), (d), and (e),
which would require disclosure on whether:
• The de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transaction is structured so that
approval of at least a majority of unaffiliated security holders is required;
• A majority of directors who are not employees of the SPAC has retained an unaffiliated
representative to act solely on behalf of unaffiliated security holders for purposes of
negotiating the terms of the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transaction
and/or preparing a report concerning the fairness of the de-SPAC transaction or any
related financing transaction; and
• The de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transaction was approved by a majority
of the directors of the SPAC who are not employees of the SPAC.
54
Request for Comment
36. Should we adopt Item 1606 as proposed?
37. Should we require a statement from the SPAC as to whether it reasonably believes that
the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction are fair or unfair to
unaffiliated security holders, as proposed? Should the scope of the fairness determination
include both the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction, as proposed?
Should the fairness determination be as to the SPAC’s security holders as a whole, rather
than to the SPAC’s unaffiliated security holders? The factors enumerated in proposed
Item 1606(b) in determining fairness include, but are not limited to, the valuation of the
target company, the consideration of any financial projections, any report, opinion, or
appraisal described in Item 1607 of Regulation S-K, and the dilutive effects described in
Item 1604(c) of Regulation S-K. Is there any additional or alternative information that
should be disclosed in connection with the SPAC’s fairness determination?
38. Should we include an instruction to Item 1606 that a statement that the SPAC has no
reasonable belief as to the fairness or unfairness of the de-SPAC transaction or any
related financing transaction to unaffiliated security holders will not be considered
sufficient disclosure in response to Item 1606(a), as proposed?
39. What are the potential benefits and costs of the statement that would be required by
proposed Item 1606(a)? Would the costs of complying with this disclosure requirement
discourage SPAC initial public offerings or discourage private operating companies from
pursuing business combinations with SPACs?
40. Should we require registrants to disclose whether any director voted against, or abstained
from voting on, the approval of a de-SPAC transaction or any related financing
55
transaction, as well as the reasons for such vote or abstention, as proposed? Are there
additional or alternative disclosures that we should require in this regard?
41. Should we require registrants to discuss in reasonable detail the material factors and, to
the extent practicable, the weight assigned to each factor underlying the fairness
determination, as proposed? Are there additional or alternative factors that should be
specified in the proposed rule to enhance an investor’s understanding of the fairness
determination?
42. How would investors use disclosure about whether the approval of at least a majority of
unaffiliated security holders is required and whether the de-SPAC transaction or any
related financing transaction was approved by a majority of non-employee directors of
the SPAC? How would investors use disclosure about whether a representative has been
retained to represent the investors in the negotiations of the de-SPAC transaction?
3. Reports, Opinions, and Appraisals
In addition, we are proposing Item 1607 to require disclosure about certain reports,
opinions, or appraisals from outside parties.97 Proposed Item 1607(a) would require disclosure
about whether or not the SPAC or its sponsor has received any report, opinion, or appraisal
obtained from an outside party relating to the consideration or the fairness of the consideration to
be offered to security holders or the fairness of the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing
transaction to the SPAC, the sponsor or security holders who are not affiliates.
98 This
requirement would provide additional transparency about whether a SPAC’s board of directors
 97 As noted above, we have modeled the proposed requirements in Item 1607 on the disclosures required in goingprivate transactions subject to Exchange Act Rule 13e-3. See Item 1015 of Regulation M-A.
98 Though currently not a routine practice in de-SPAC transactions, SPACs often obtain fairness opinions in
connection with de-SPAC transactions involving an affiliated private operating company.
56
and/or its sponsor have access to information underlying a fairness determination that
shareholders could find useful in making voting, investment, and redemption decisions in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction.
99
To assist investors in considering the usefulness and reliability of any outside party
report, opinion or appraisal described in response to proposed Item 1607(a), as well as any
negotiation or report by an unaffiliated representative acting solely on behalf of unaffiliated
security holders described in response to proposed Item 1606(d), proposed Item 1607(b) would
require disclosure of:
• The identity, qualifications, and method of selection of the outside party and/or
unaffiliated representative;
• Any material relationship between (1) the outside party, its affiliates, and/or unaffiliated
representative, and (2) the SPAC, its sponsor and/or their affiliates, that existed during
the past two years or is mutually understood to be contemplated and any compensation
received or to be received as a result of the relationship;100
• Whether the SPAC or the sponsor determined the amount of consideration to be paid to
the private operating company or its security holders, or the valuation of the private
operating company, or whether the outside party recommended the amount of
consideration to be paid or the valuation of the private operating company; and
 99 For example, the proposed rule would require a SPAC to disclose whether or not the SPAC or its sponsor has
received a fairness opinion or valuation report from a financial advisor.
100 For example, this disclosure could include whether the compensation for a financial advisor’s fairness opinion is
conditioned on the completion of the de-SPAC transaction or whether the amount of compensation due the financial
advisor may include a bonus or may be increased depending on the ultimate financial terms of the de-SPAC
transaction.
57
• A summary concerning the negotiation, report, opinion or appraisal, which would be
required to include a description of the procedures followed; the findings and
recommendations; the bases for and methods of arriving at such findings and
recommendations; instructions received from the SPAC or its sponsor; and any limitation
imposed by the SPAC or its sponsor on the scope of the investigation.
Finally, proposed Item 1607(c) would require all such reports, opinions or appraisals to
be filed as exhibits to the Form S-4, Form F-4, and Schedule TO for the de-SPAC transaction or
included in the Schedule 14A or 14C for the transaction, as applicable.
Request for Comment
43. Should we require disclosure regarding reports, opinions, or appraisals from an outside
party, as proposed? Is there any additional or alternative information that we should
require with respect to these reports, opinions, or appraisals? Is there any proposed
information that should not be required?
44. Should we require that the reports, opinions or appraisals be filed as exhibits to the
Form S-4, Form F-4, or Schedule TO for the de-SPAC transaction or included in the
Schedule 14A or Schedule 14C for the transaction, as proposed? Should we require
instead that such reports, opinions, or appraisals be made available for inspection and
copying upon written request? Should we require the filing of board books and other
written materials presented to the board in connection with the reports, opinions, or
appraisals, as is the case with going-private transactions? Are there other means by
which investors should be able to access such report, opinion, or appraisal, such as
posting on a website?
58
45. As proposed, filers would be required to include a summary of the report, opinion, or
appraisal and file such report, opinion, or appraisal as an exhibit to the filing. Would
investors benefit from having both the summary and the actual report, opinion, or
appraisal disclosed, or would one or the other item of disclosure be sufficient?
4. Proposed Item 1608 of Regulation S-K
We are proposing Item 1608 of Regulation S-K to codify a staff position that a
Schedule TO filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction should contain substantially the
same information about a target private operating company that is required under the proxy rules
and that a SPAC must comply with the procedural requirements of the tender offer rules when
conducting the transaction for which the Schedule TO is filed, such as a redemption of the SPAC
securities. Redemption rights offered by a SPAC to its security holders in connection with the
de-SPAC transaction or an extension of the timeframe to complete a de-SPAC transaction
generally have indicia of being a tender offer, but the Commission staff has not objected if a
SPAC does not comply with the tender offer rules when the SPAC files a Schedule 14A or 14C
in connection with a de-SPAC transaction or an extension and complies with Regulation 14A or
14C, because the federal proxy rules would generally mandate substantially similar disclosures
and applicable procedural protections as required by the tender offer rules.
101 Proposed Item
1608, if adopted, would not affect the availability of this staff position for those SPACs that file
Schedule 14A or 14C for their de-SPAC transactions or extensions. SPACs that are unable to
avail themselves of this position and file a Schedule TO (such as foreign private issuers102),
 101 See supra note 21.
102 “Foreign private issuer” is defined in Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-4(c). A foreign private
issuer is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government, except for an issuer that (1) has more than 50% of its
outstanding voting securities held of record by U.S. residents and (2) any of the following: (i) a majority of its
officers and directors are citizens or residents of the United States, (ii) more than 50 percent of its assets are located
in the United States, or (iii) its business is principally administered in the United States.
59
however, would be subject to the requirements of proposed Item 1608 of Regulation S-K, which
would codify the staff’s view regarding the information required to be included in a Schedule TO
filed for a SPAC redemption and clarify the need to comply with the procedural requirements of
the tender offer rules.103
Proposed Item 1608 would require a SPAC that files a Schedule TO pursuant to
Exchange Act Rule 13e-4(c)(2) for any redemption of securities offered in connection with a deSPAC transaction to include disclosures required by specified provisions of Forms S-4 and F-4,
and Schedule 14A, as applicable. Proposed Item 1608 would specify and standardize the
information required in a Schedule TO that is filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction so
that it is consistent with the information required by the proposed amendments to Forms S-4 and
F-4 and Schedule 14A. As a result, SPAC shareholders who are not solicited for their votes to
approve a de-SPAC transaction (in a solicitation subject to Regulation 14A) would nevertheless
receive the same information about the target private operating company that could be material
to their redemption decisions.
104 Proposed Item 1608 would clarify that SPACs that file a
Schedule TO for a redemption also must comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 13e-4
and Regulation 14E (such as the requirement to keep the redemption period open for at least 20
business days). This proposed codification would eliminate any potential ambiguity as to the
 103 The staff has historically expressed the view that the same information about the target company that would be
required in a Schedule 14A should be included in such a Schedule TO, in view of the requirements of Item 11 of
Schedule TO and Item 1011(c) of Regulation M-A and the importance of this information in making a redemption
decision. Item 11 of Schedule TO states “Furnish the information required by Item 1011(a) and (c) of Regulation
M-A.” Item 1011(c) of Regulation M-A states “Furnish such additional material information, if any, as may be
necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not materially
misleading.”
104 Proposed Item 1608 would also be consistent with exchange listing rules regarding the use of Schedule TO in
de-SPAC transactions. See, e.g., Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(e) and NYSE Listed Company Manual Section
102.06(c).
60
SPAC’s obligation to provide the tender offer rules’ procedural protections to the SPAC security
holders who are considering whether to redeem their securities.
Request for Comment
46. Should we adopt Item 1608 as proposed?
47. Is there any additional or alternative information that we should require in proposed
Item 1608 when a Schedule TO is filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction?
48. Are there any requirements of Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E that should not apply to
SPACs that file a Schedule TO for the redemption of the SPAC securities?
49. Are there any other provisions of Rule 13e-4 or Regulation 14E that should be amended
to ensure that SPAC security holders are provided with the information material to their
decision on whether to redeem their SPAC securities or to address other issues arising
from the SPAC redemption process? For example, should we amend Exchange Act Rule
14e-5, which generally prohibits a bidder or its affiliates from making purchases outside
of a tender offer, to permit a sponsor’s purchases of SPAC securities outside of the
redemption offer as long as certain conditions are satisfied (such as requiring disclosures
of the sponsor’s purchases and limiting the purchase price to no more than the price
offered through the redemption offer), e.g., in a manner consistent with the Division of
Corporation Finance’s Tender Offers and Schedules Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation 166.01 (Mar. 22, 2022)?105
50. As noted above, the staff has taken the position that a SPAC filing a Schedule 14A or
14C in connection with a de-SPAC transaction or an extension of the time frame to
complete a de-SPAC transaction would not need to file a Schedule TO or otherwise

105 This staff interpretation is available at: https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cdi-tender-offers-andschedules.htm.

comply with the tender offer rules, including the procedural requirements of the tender
offer rules, such as the all-holders requirement. Should we codify this position? Should
we reconsider this position?
G. Structured Data Requirement
We are proposing to require SPACs to tag all information disclosed pursuant to Subpart
1600 of Regulation S-K in a structured, machine-readable data language. Specifically, we are
proposing to require SPACs to tag the disclosures required under Subpart 1600 in Inline XBRL
in accordance with Rule 405 of Regulation S-T and the EDGAR Filer Manual.106 The proposed
requirements would include detail tagging of the quantitative disclosures and block text tagging
of the narrative disclosures that would be required under Subpart 1600.
In 2009, the Commission adopted rules requiring operating companies to submit the
information from the financial statements (including footnotes and schedules thereto) included in
certain registration statements and periodic and current reports in a structured, machine-readable
data language using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”).107 In 2018, the
Commission adopted modifications to these requirements by requiring issuers to use Inline
XBRL, which is both machine-readable and human-readable, to reduce the time and effort
 106 This tagging requirement would be implemented by including a cross-reference to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T in
Subpart 1600 of Regulation S-K, and by revising 17 CFR 232.405(b) of Regulation S-T to include the proposed
SPAC-related disclosures. A corresponding Note and Instruction would also be added to Schedules 14A and TO,
respectively. Pursuant to Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, the EDGAR Filer Manual is incorporated by reference into
the Commission’s rules. In conjunction with the EDGAR Filer Manual, Regulation S-T governs the electronic
submission of documents filed with the Commission. Rule 405 of Regulation S-T specifically governs the scope
and manner of disclosure tagging requirements for operating companies and investment companies, including the
requirement in 17 CFR 232.405(a)(3) to use Inline XBRL as the specific structured data language to use for tagging
the disclosures.

2009)] (“2009 Financial Statement Information Adopting Release”) (requiring submission of an Interactive Data
File to the Commission in exhibits to such reports). See also Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting,
Release No. 33-9002A (Apr. 1, 2009) [74 FR 15666 (Apr. 7, 2009)].
62
associated with preparing XBRL filings and improve the quality and usability of XBRL data for
investors.108
Requiring Inline XBRL tagging of the Subpart 1600 disclosures would benefit investors
by making SPAC disclosures more readily available and easily accessible to investors and other
market participants for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis, as compared to
requiring a non-machine readable data language such as ASCII or HTML. This would enable
automated extraction and analysis of granular SPAC disclosures, allowing investors and other
market participants to more efficiently perform large-scale analysis and comparison of SPAC
disclosures across SPAC transactions and time periods, including information on sponsor
compensation and material conflicts of interest. At the same time, we do not expect the
incremental compliance burden associated with tagging the additional information to be unduly
burdensome, because SPACs subject to the proposed tagging requirements would be subject to
similar Inline XBRL requirements in other Commission filings.109 However, because issuers
(including SPACs) are not required to tag any filings until after they have filed a periodic report
on Form 10-Q, 20-F, or 40-F, the proposed tagging requirement for disclosures in SPAC IPO
registration statements would accelerate the tagging obligations (and related compliance
burdens) of SPACs compared to those of other filers.110 Enhancing the usability of the SPAC
initial public offering disclosures through a tagging requirement is of particular importance given
the unique nature of SPAC offerings and the potential risks they present to investors.

2018)]. Inline XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL data directly into an HTML document, eliminating the need to
tag a copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit. Id. at 40851.

Request for Comment
51. Should we require SPACs to tag the disclosures required by Subpart 1600 of Regulation
S-K, as proposed? Are there any changes we should make to ensure accurate and
consistent tagging? If so, what changes should we make?
52. Should we modify the scope of the Subpart 1600 disclosures required to be tagged? For
example, should we require tagging of quantitative disclosures only? Should we limit the
tagging requirement to only those disclosures required in de-SPAC transactions?
53. Where an item in Subpart 1600 requests that a registrant provide a tabular presentation
without specifying a particular format for the table, or data points to include in the table,
such as the proposed disclosure related to SPAC sponsor compensation, dilution of
unaffiliated shareholders, and the related sensitivity analysis, should we instead require
specific elements in the tabular presentation? If we do not propose a specific tabular
presentation or required elements, would detail tagging provide useful data for investors
and other market participants?
54. Should we require SPACs to use a different structured data language to tag the Subpart
1600 disclosures? If so, what structured data language should we require, and why?
55. We have not proposed exemptions or different requirements from the proposed structured
data requirement for foreign private issuers, smaller reporting companies,111 or emerging
growth companies.112 Should we exempt or provide different requirements from some or
all of the proposed structured data requirements for these or other classes of registrants?
 111 See infra Section III.D.
112 Section 101(a) of the JOBS Act amended Section 2(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(a)] and Section 3(a)
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)] to define an “emerging growth company” as an issuer with less than $1
billion in total annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal year, as such amount is indexed for
inflation every five years by the Commission. If an issuer qualifies as an EGC on the first day of its fiscal year, it

III. ALIGNING DE-SPAC TRANSACTIONS WITH INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS
As discussed above, private operating companies have increasingly turned to de-SPAC
transactions as a means of accessing public securities markets and becoming public reporting
companies. As the SPACs that were part of the unprecedented growth in the SPAC market in
2020 and 2021 continue to identify target private operating companies and consummate deSPAC transactions, it is likely that a significant proportion of companies in the coming years that
enter the U.S. public securities markets will do so through de-SPAC transactions.
A private operating company’s path to the public markets through a de-SPAC transaction
usually commences when a SPAC begins considering it as a potential business combination
candidate. After agreeing to the terms of the business combination, the SPAC typically files a
Form 8-K announcing the transaction that includes limited information on the material terms of
the business combination agreement.113 This announcement is usually followed by a disclosure
document (a Securities Act registration statement, proxy statement, or information statement)
filed by the SPAC that includes more extensive information about the private operating
company.
114 SPACs use a variety of legal structures to effect de-SPAC transactions, and the
particular transaction structure and the consideration used can affect (1) the Commission filings

maintains that status until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it has total
annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of
the first sale of its common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (3) the date on which the
issuer has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt; or (4) the date
on which the issuer is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2). See Section
2(a)(19) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19)]; Section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80)];
and Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act, Release No. 33-
10332 (Mar. 31, 2017) [82 FR 17545 (Apr. 12, 2017)].
113 A SPAC is required to file a Form 8-K that provides certain disclosures regarding the business combination
agreement if the agreement is a material definitive agreement not made in the ordinary course of business. See
Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
114 The disclosure document may be a Form S-4 or F-4, Schedule 14A or Schedule TO, depending on, among other
things, whether shareholder approval is required and whether the SPAC is registering an offering of shares to be
issued in the transaction.
65
required for the transaction,115 (2) which entity will have a continuing Exchange Act reporting
obligation following the transaction,116 and (3) the disclosures provided in connection with the
transaction.
117
After the completion of the de-SPAC transaction, the post-business combination
company is required to file a Form 8-K within four business days that includes even more
information about the private operating company that is equivalent to the information that a new
reporting company would be required to provide when filing a Form 10 under the Exchange
Act.
118 The result is that investors may receive disclosures about the future public company that
 115 SPACs may use cash, securities, or a combination of both to acquire a target company in a de-SPAC transaction,
and the form of consideration is a factor in determining whether a registration statement, proxy or information
statement, or tender offer statement is required to be filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction. Additionally,
the SPAC, the target company or a new holding company may issue securities in a de-SPAC transaction, which may
necessitate the filing of a registration statement on Form S-4 or F-4 for the transaction.
116 For example, when a holding company is formed to acquire both the private operating company and the SPAC,
and the holding company files a registration statement for the de-SPAC transaction, generally the holding company
would continue as the registrant with the Exchange Act reporting obligation following the transaction. In these
situations, the private operating company would be the holding company’s predecessor, as the term is used in
Regulation S-X, with respect to the financial statements and possibly the accounting acquirer under generally
accepted accounting principles as used in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), with the equity ownership percentage in
the combined company held by the former owners of the private operating company and the degree to which former
management of the private operating company continues with the combined company among the factors that could
impact the accounting acquirer determination under U.S. GAAP. Under the proposed amendments to Regulation SX, the SPAC would be an acquired business. See infra Section IV.B.
117 The disclosures required in connection with a de-SPAC transaction are determined by the applicable disclosure
form (Form S-4 or F-4, Schedule 14A or 14C, or Schedule TO) and which entity is filing the form. Under the
proposed amendments, companies would not be subject to the same disclosure requirements in every de-SPAC
transaction structure. For example, if the SPAC is a domestic registrant and a new holding company is a foreign
issuer, and the private operating company meets the criteria to be a foreign private issuer, the holding company (the
company filing the de-SPAC transaction filing) would also qualify as a foreign private issuer. Foreign private issuer
status would permit the foreign holding company to file a Form F-4 for the de-SPAC transaction and apply the
foreign private issuer disclosure regime. In contrast, if a de-SPAC transaction is structured so that (1) a domestic
SPAC is the company issuing securities as the acquiring entity of the foreign private operating company, (2) there is
no foreign holding company, and (3) the SPAC makes the de-SPAC transaction filing, the registrant would continue
to be a domestic issuer and follow domestic reporting rules until the next determination date for foreign private
issuer status.
118 Form 10 is the long-form registration statement to register a class of securities under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of
the Exchange Act. See Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and 9.01(c) of Form 8-K. By the time the Form 8-K with Form 10
information is filed, the securities of the post-business combination company have often already begun trading on a
national securities exchange with a new ticker symbol, in that the securities of the SPAC generally trade on an
exchange until the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction, after which the securities of the post-business
combination company generally commence trading on the following business day.
66
differ from, or are not provided in the same manner as, the information disclosed in a Form S-1
or F-1 filed in connection with a traditional initial public offering. Additionally, some of the
investor protections afforded in a traditional initial public offering are not available or are more
attenuated when a private operating company becomes a public company through a de-SPAC
transaction.119
In light of the increasingly common reliance on de-SPAC transactions as a vehicle for
private operating companies to access the U.S. public securities markets, we are proposing a
number of new rules and amendments to existing rules to align more closely the treatment of
private operating companies entering the public markets through de-SPAC transactions with that
of companies conducting traditional initial public offerings. In our view, a private operating
company’s method of becoming a public company should not negatively impact investor
protection. Accordingly, the proposed new rules and amendments are intended to provide
investors with disclosures and liability protections comparable to those that would be present if
the private operating company were to conduct a traditional firm commitment initial public
offering.
These proposed new rules and amendments would (1) more closely align the nonfinancial statement disclosure requirements with respect to the private operating company in
disclosure documents for a de-SPAC transaction with the disclosure required in a Form S-1 or F-
 119 For example, a private company engaged in a traditional initial public offering is generally more limited in its
ability to make communications about its offering prior to the filing of a Securities Act registrations statement on
Form S-1 than companies engaged in a business combination transaction that will be registered on Form S-4 or F-4.
De-SPAC transactions also often lack named underwriters that perform due diligence and other traditional
gatekeeping functions, and it may be more difficult for investors to trace their purchases to the registered de-SPAC
transaction for purposes of establishing a Section 11 claim for material misstatements or omissions in de-SPAC
disclosure documents.
67
1 for an initial public offering;120 (2) require a minimum dissemination period for disclosure
documents in de-SPAC transactions; (3) treat the private operating company as a co-registrant of
the Form S-4 or Form F-4 for a de-SPAC transaction when a SPAC is filing the registration
statement; (4) require a re-determination of smaller reporting company status following the
consummation of a de-SPAC transaction; (5) amend the definition of “blank check company” for
PSLRA purposes such that the safe harbor for forward-looking information would not apply to
projections in filings by SPACs and certain other blank check companies that are not penny
stock issuers; and (6) provide, in a Commission rule, that underwriters in a SPAC initial public
offering are deemed to be underwriters in a subsequent de-SPAC transaction under certain
circumstances.
A. Aligning Non-Financial Disclosures in De-SPAC Disclosure Documents
In regard to non-financial statement disclosures, we are proposing that, if the target
company in a de-SPAC transaction is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, disclosure with respect to such company pursuant to the following
items in Regulation S-K would be required in the registration statement or schedule filed in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction: (1) Item 101 (description of business); (2) Item 102
(description of property); (3) Item 103 (legal proceedings); (4) Item 304 (changes in and
disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure); (5) Item 403 (security
ownership of certain beneficial owners and management, assuming the completion of the de-
 120 We are also proposing to more closely align the financial statement disclosure requirements with respect to the
private operating company in any business combination involving a shell company with the disclosure required in a
Form S-1 for an initial public offering, which would encompass de-SPAC transactions. See infra Section IV.B.
68
SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction);121 and (6) Item 701 (recent sales of
unregistered securities).122 If the private operating company is a foreign private issuer,123 the
proposed rules would include the option of providing disclosure relating to the private operating
company in accordance with Items 3.C, 4, 6.E, 7.A, 8.A.7, and 9.E of Form 20-F, consistent with
disclosure that could be provided by these entities in an initial public offering.
124
The proposed additional information is already required to be included in a Form 8-K due
within four business days of the completion of the de-SPAC transaction, such that registrants
currently should already be preparing this information in anticipation of this Form 8-K filing in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction.125 Aligning the disclosure requirements in de-SPAC
transactions in this manner with those in initial public offerings would mandate that this
additional information about the private operating company be provided to shareholders before
they make voting, investment, or redemption decisions in connection with the proposed
 121 We note that Item 18(a)(5) of Form S-4 currently requires disclosure pursuant to Item 403 regarding the target
company and a SPAC’s principal shareholders, through Item 6 of Schedule 14A, in a Form S-4 that includes a proxy
seeking shareholder approval of the de-SPAC transaction.
122 Proposed General Instruction L.2. to Form S-4; Proposed General Instruction I.2. to Form F-4; Proposed Item
14(f) of Schedule 14A; Proposed General Instruction K to Schedule TO. We note that disclosure pursuant to Item
303 (management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations) of Regulation S-K is
already required with respect to a non-reporting target company in Forms S-4 and F-4 and in Schedules 14A and
14C for a de-SPAC transaction. As proposed, disclosure pursuant to Item 701 of Regulation S-K would be required
in Part I (information required in the prospectus) of Form S-4 and Form F-4, whereas in Form S-1, the Item 701
disclosure requirement appears under Part II (information not required in prospectus) of the form.
123 See supra note 102.
124 Disclosure requirements for foreign private issuers differ from domestic registrants, including the absence of
quarterly reporting requirements, the use of different forms with different disclosure provisions, and an ability to
present financial statements in accordance with IFRS instead of U.S. GAAP. In addition, foreign private issuers are
not required to file current reports on Form 8-K using the Form 8-K disclosure criteria; rather, they can furnish
current reports on Form 6-K applying the disclosure requirements of that Form. See Foreign Issuer Reporting
Enhancements, Release 33-8959 (Sep. 23, 2008) [73 FR 58300 (Oct. 6, 2008)].
125 This Form 8-K is required to include the same information that would be required for a newly reporting
company when filing a Form 10 under the Exchange Act. See Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and 9.01(c) of Form 8-K.
In this regard, we note that these items of Form 8-K each provide that if any disclosure required by these items has
been previously reported, the registrant may identify the filing in which that disclosure is included instead of
including that disclosure in the Form 8-K.
69
transactions.126 As proposed, this information would also be available to investors prior to the
inception of trading of the post-business combination company’s securities on a national
securities exchange, rather than being required in a Form 8-K due within four business days of
the completion of the de-SPAC transaction. Further, if this disclosure is included in a Form S-4
or Form F-4, any material misstatements or omissions contained therein would subject the
issuers and other parties to liability under Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act, which would
align with the protections afforded to investors under the Securities Act for disclosures provided
in a Form S-1 or F-1 for an initial public offering.
Request for Comment
56. Should we require additional information regarding the private operating company in
disclosure documents filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction, as proposed?
Would these additional disclosures provide investors with a better understanding of the
private operating company’s operations and related risks? Should we require more or
less disclosure regarding the private operating company in the registration statements or
schedules filed in connection with de-SPAC transactions?
57. What are the benefits of providing this information earlier to investors when they are
making voting, investment, and redemption decisions in connection with a de-SPAC
transaction or at or before the commencement of trading in the post-business combination
company’s securities on a securities exchange? Would it be unduly burdensome to
provide this additional information regarding the private operating company at this earlier
point in time?
 126 In this regard, we note that many, but not all, Forms S-4 and F-4 and Schedules 14A and 14C that are filed in
connection with de-SPAC transactions contain information about the target company as proposed. The proposed
amendments, if adopted, would require that this information be provided in all de-SPAC transactions subject to the
specialized disclosure requirements in Subpart 1600.

58. Should a private operating company that would qualify as a foreign private issuer have
the option of providing disclosure in accordance with certain items of Form 20-F, as
proposed?
59. Should we require additional or less information in proposed Item 1608 and Schedule TO
when a SPAC files a Schedule TO in connection with a de-SPAC transaction? For
example, should we require disclosure regarding management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations (Item 303 of Regulation S-K) pursuant to
Item 1608 or Schedule TO?
60. Should the proposed disclosure requirements with respect to the private operating
company be scaled to take into account the size, nature, or certain characteristics of the
company?
B. Minimum Dissemination Period
In addition to the need for enhanced disclosure in de-SPAC transactions, we recognize
the importance of ensuring that SPAC shareholders have adequate time to analyze the
information presented in these transactions. There is currently no federally mandated period in
business combination transactions to provide security holders with a minimum amount of time to
consider proxy statement or other disclosures.127 In view of the unique circumstances
surrounding de-SPAC transactions, we are proposing to amend Exchange Act Rules 14a-6 and
14c-2, as well as to add instructions to Forms S-4 and F-4,128 to require that prospectuses and
proxy and information statements filed in connection with de-SPAC transactions be distributed
 127 In Form S-4 and Form F-4, however, there is a minimum 20-business day period requirement in sending a
prospectus to security holders prior to a security holder meeting that is applicable when a registrant incorporates by
reference information about the registrant or the company being acquired into the form. General Instruction A.2 of
Form S-4 and General Instruction A.2 of Form F-4.
128 Proposed General Instruction L.3. to Form S-4; Proposed General Instruction I.3. to Form F-4.
71
to shareholders at least 20 calendar days in advance of a shareholder meeting or the earliest date
of action by consent, or the maximum period for disseminating such disclosure documents
permitted under the applicable laws of the SPAC’s jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
if such period is less than 20 calendar days.129 As stated above, SPACs are organized for the
purpose of completing a de-SPAC transaction within a certain time frame, and as a SPAC
approaches the end of this period, there is less time available for a SPAC to find a candidate for a
business combination transaction, prepare and file the appropriate de-SPAC disclosure
documents with the Commission, disseminate such documents to its shareholders, receive the
requisite shareholder approval when applicable, and consummate the de-SPAC transaction.
Although the laws of a SPAC’s jurisdiction of incorporation or organization may require the
SPAC to send a notice to its shareholders at least a specified number of days before the
shareholder meeting to approve a proposed business combination transaction, such notices are
generally limited to information regarding the time, place, and purpose of the meeting, along
with a copy or summary of the business combination agreement.130 They do not generally
require a minimum period of time for dissemination of any other information about the
transaction (including any proxy statements or other materials required by the federal securities
laws) to shareholders.131 Similarly, such requirements do not exist in exchange listing
 129 The proposed amendments would be applicable to Forms S-4 and F-4 and Schedules 14A and 14C. We are not
proposing to amend the 20 business day period when a Schedule TO is filed in connection with a de-SPAC
transaction. See supra Section II.F.4.
130 See, e.g., DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, sec. 251(c) (2022) (stating, in part, that “[d]ue notice of the time, place and
purpose of the meeting shall be given to each holder of stock, whether voting or nonvoting, of the corporation at the
stockholder’s address as it appears on the records of the corporation, at least 20 days prior to the date of the meeting
[to vote on an agreement of merger or consolidation]”).
131 See R. Franklin Balotti, et al., Delaware Law of Corporations and Business Organizations, § 9.16 (4th ed. 2022
& Supp. 2022) (“[t]he only statutory requirements for the notice of the meeting are that it state the time, place and
purpose of the meeting and that the notice contain a copy of the merger agreement or a summary of the
72
standards.132 Without a minimum period for dissemination of prospectuses, proxy statements,
and other materials before a shareholder meeting (or action by consent), a SPAC and its sponsor
may have incentives to provide prospectuses or proxy or information statements for a de-SPAC
transaction to the SPAC’s security holders within an abbreviated time frame, leaving the security
holders with relatively little time to review what are often complex disclosure documents for
these transactions.
We are proposing a minimum 20-calendar day dissemination period for prospectuses and
proxy and information statements that, in our view, would provide an important investor
protection.133 We recognize that SPACs are often required under their governing instruments
and applicable exchange listing rules to complete de-SPAC transactions within a certain time
frame and that relying on the safe harbor we are proposing under the Investment Company Act
would also limit the time frame in which to announce and complete a de-SPAC transaction.134
Nevertheless, given the complexity of the SPAC structure, the conflicts of interest that are often
present in this structure and the effects of dilution on non-redeeming shareholders, the proposed
20-calendar day period would establish a minimum time period for shareholders to review

agreement…[i]n practice, of course, many such meetings will be governed by the federal proxy rules, which require
that a full proxy statement be submitted to the stockholders.”).
132 Although both the NYSE and Nasdaq generally require that listed companies solicit proxies and provide proxy
statements for all shareholder meetings, neither requires a minimum number of days between when proxy materials
are provided to shareholders and when the meeting is held. Instead, for example, NYSE Listed Company Manual
Section 402.03 simply “recommends that a minimum of 30 days be allowed between the record and meeting dates
so as to give ample time for the solicitation of proxies.”
133 The proposed 20-calendar day period is the same length of time as the 20-day advance disclosure period in 17
CFR 13e-3(f)(1) (Exchange Act Rule 13e-3(f)(1)). In adopting a 20-day advance disclosure requirement for
dissemination of documents in connection with going private transactions, the Commission stated this requirement
was intended to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed to security holders would
be disseminated sufficiently far in advance of the transactions to permit security holders to make “an unhurried and
informed” decision. Going Private Transactions by Public Companies or Their Affiliates, Release No. 33-6100
(Aug. 2, 1979) [44 FR 46736 (Aug. 8, 1979)].

73
prospectuses and proxy and information statements in de-SPAC transactions (subject to the
carve-out discussed below),135 so that they have sufficient time to consider the disclosures and to
make more informed voting, investment and redemption decisions.136 In the event that the laws
of a SPAC’s jurisdiction of incorporation or organization have a provision applicable to the
dissemination of prospectuses and proxy and information statements required under the federal
securities laws, we are proposing to include a provision that would require a registrant to satisfy
the maximum dissemination period permitted under the applicable law of such jurisdiction when
this period is less than 20 calendar days to avoid conflicting with such a requirement.137
Request for Comment
61. Should we require a minimum dissemination period for prospectuses and proxy or
information statements in de-SPAC transactions as proposed? Is a 20–day period
necessary or appropriate to enable shareholders to review and consider these disclosure
documents relating to a de-SPAC transaction? Should this 20 calendar day period be
 135 When a registrant incorporates by reference information about the registrant or the company being acquired in
the Form S-4 or F-4 for a de-SPAC transaction, the 20-business day period in Form S-4 and Form F-4, which we are
not proposing to amend, would continue to be applicable. General Instruction A.2 of Form S-4 and General
Instruction A.2 of Form F-4.
136 The proposed minimum dissemination period is intended to apply to the dissemination of certain Commission
filings in connection with de-SPAC transactions and is not intended to impact any requirements of the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization regarding the notice of an annual or special meeting, such as Section 251(c) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.
137 For example, if the jurisdiction has no minimum dissemination period and does not have a maximum
dissemination period, the minimum 20-day period, as proposed, would apply. If the jurisdiction has a minimum
dissemination period of less than 20 days (e.g., 10 days) and does not have a maximum dissemination period, the
minimum 20-day period, as proposed, would apply. If the jurisdiction has a minimum dissemination period of less
than 20 days (e.g., 10 days) and a maximum dissemination period of less than 20 days (e.g., 15 days), the maximum
dissemination period under the jurisdiction would apply. If the jurisdiction has no minimum dissemination period
and a maximum dissemination period of less than 20 days (e.g., 15 days), the maximum dissemination period under
the jurisdiction would apply.
74
longer or shorter? Should the minimum dissemination period be based on business days
(e.g., 20 business days) instead of calendar days as proposed?
62. Would there be timing concerns on the part of SPACs in meeting the proposed minimum
20-day dissemination period? Should we include an exception for the applicable laws of
the SPAC’s jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as proposed? Should we
include other exceptions to the proposed minimum 20-day dissemination period?
63. Would additional guidance be helpful in determining how to apply this proposed
requirement?
64. Are there additional or alternative requirements we should adopt in connection with the
dissemination of disclosure documents in a de-SPAC transaction?
C. Private Operating Company as Co-Registrant to Form S-4 and Form F-4
Under Section 6(a) of the Securities Act, each “issuer” must sign a Securities Act
registration statement.138 The Securities Act broadly defines the term “issuer” to include every
person who issues or proposes to issue any securities.139 Currently, when a SPAC offers and
sells its securities in a registered de-SPAC transaction, only the SPAC, its principal executive
officer or officers, its principal financial officer, its controller or principal accounting officer, and
at least a majority of its board of directors (or persons performing similar functions) are required
to sign the registration statement for the transaction. In these situations, the private operating
company, for which the de-SPAC transaction effectively serves as its initial public offering, and
 138 In addition, Section 6(a) requires the issuer’s principal executive officer or officers, principal financial officer,
comptroller or principal accounting officer, and the majority of its board of directors or persons performing similar
functions (or, if there is no board of directors or persons performing similar functions, by the majority of the persons
or board having the power of management of the issuer) to sign a registration statement. When the issuer is a
foreign entity, the registration statement must also be signed by the issuer’s duly authorized representative in the
United States.
139 Section 2(a)(4) of the Securities Act.
75
its officers and directors do not sign the registration statement that contains disclosure about the
private operating company’s business and financial results and thereby may avoid liability as
signatories to the registration statement under Section 11 of the Securities Act, unlike if the
private operating company had conducted a traditional initial public offering registered on Form
S-1 or Form F-1.140
We are proposing to amend Form S-4 and Form F-4 to require that the SPAC and the
target company be treated as co-registrants when these registration statements are filed by the
SPAC in connection with a de-SPAC transaction.141 In view of the protections that the
Securities Act provides to investors in a traditional initial public offering, it is appropriate in our
view to interpret Section 6(a) to encompass the target company, in addition to the SPAC, as an
issuer for purposes of Section 6(a) and the signature requirements of Form S-4 or Form F-4.
A de-SPAC transaction marks the introduction of the private operating company to the
U.S. public securities markets, and investors look to the business and prospects of the private
operating company in evaluating an investment in the combined company.142 Accordingly, it is
the private operating company that, in substance, issues or proposes to issue its securities, as
 140 Even when not liable under Section 11, the private operating company and its affiliates, however, may be subject
to enforcement actions by the Commission, including those under Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, as well as potential liability under 17 CFR 240.10b-5 (Exchange Act Rule 10b-5) in
private rights of action. See, e.g., In the Matter of Momentus, Inc., et al., Release No. 34-92391 (July 13, 2021)
(settled proceeding charging privately held company with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 for, among other things, allegedly materially false statements and
omissions in the registration statement/proxy statement filed in connection with a business combination with a
publicly traded SPAC).
141 Proposed General Instruction L.4. to Form S-4; Proposed General Instruction I.4. to Form F-4. Section 6(a) of
the Securities Act uses the term “issuer,” but Securities Act registration statement forms use the term “registrant.”
The term “registrant” is defined in Rule 405 as “the issuer of the securities for which the registration statement is
filed.” As a co-registrant of the Form S-4 or Form F-4, the private operating company would have an Exchange Act
reporting obligation pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act following the effectiveness of the registration
statement.
142 That is, the operations of the private company constitute the business and the basis for the financial and other
disclosures of the newly combined public company following a de-SPAC transaction.
76
securities of the newly combined public company.143 While similar policy considerations can
arise in other business combination contexts, given the substantial increase in the number of
SPAC transactions in recent years, the number of shareholders typically impacted by such
transactions, and concerns that are unique to the SPAC structure, we are concerned that a narrow
approach to registrant status in de-SPAC transactions could undermine the statutory liability
scheme that Congress applied to initial public offerings of securities.
We are proposing to amend the signature instructions to Form S-4 and F-4 to state that, if
a SPAC is offering its securities in a de-SPAC transaction that is registered on the form, the term
“registrant” for purposes of the signature requirements of the form would mean the SPAC and
the target company.
144 This requirement would make the additional signatories to the form,
including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller/principal
accounting officer, and a majority of the board of directors or persons performing similar
functions of the target company, liable (subject to a due diligence defense for all parties other
than the SPAC and the target company), for any material misstatements or omissions in the
 143 The legislative history of the broad definition of the term “issuer” in the Securities Act suggests that the
identification of the “issuer” of a security should be based on the economic reality of a transaction to ensure that, in
service of the disclosure purpose of the Act, the person(s) that have access to the information relevant to investors
are responsible as an “issuer” for providing such information. See, e.g., H.R. REP. 73-85, 12 (“Special provisions
govern the definition of ‘issuer’ in connection with security issues of an unusual character…. [For example, in the
case of an investment trust], although the actual issuer is the trustee, the depositor is the person responsible for the
flotation of the issue. Consequently, information relative to the depositor and to the basic securities is what chiefly
concerns the investor—information respecting the assets and liabilities of the trust rather than of the trustee.”).
144 The Commission has previously specified who constitutes the “registrant” for purposes of signing a Securities
Act registration statement in certain contexts. For example, an instruction in Forms S-4 and F-4 requires two or
more existing corporations to be deemed co-registrants when they will be parties to a consolidation and the
securities to be offered are those of a corporation not yet in existence at the time of filing. See Instruction 3 to the
signature page for Form S-4 and Form F-4 (“If the securities to be offered are those of a corporation not yet in
existence at the time the registration statement is filed which will be a party to a consolidation involving two or
more existing corporations, then each such existing corporation shall be deemed a registrant and shall be so
designated on the cover page of this Form, and the registration statement shall be signed by each such existing
corporation and by the officers and directors of each such existing corporation as if each such existing corporation
were the registrant.”).
77
Form S-4 or Form F-4 and would thereby mitigate the risk that the target company’s directors
and management would not be held accountable to investors for the accuracy of the disclosures
in the registration statement due to the absence of the deterrent threat of liability under
Section 11.145 Moreover, this proposed requirement could improve the reliability of the
disclosure provided to investors in connection with de-SPAC transactions by creating strong
incentives for such additional signing persons to review more closely the disclosure about the
target company in these registration statements and to conduct more searching due diligence in
connection with de-SPAC transactions and related registration statements.
Request for Comment
65. Should we amend Form S-4 and Form F-4, as proposed, to require that the SPAC and the
private operating company be treated as co-registrants when the registration statement is
filed by the SPAC in connection with a de-SPAC transaction?
66. Would amending Form S-4 and Form F-4 in this manner improve the disclosure provided
in connection with de-SPAC transactions that are registered on these forms?
67. Should the proposed amendment to Form S-4 and Form F-4 be extended to apply to all
business combination transactions where a shell company, other than a business
combination related shell company, is the acquirer?
68. Should the sponsor of a SPAC also be required to sign a Form S-4 or Form F-4 filed in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction, as well as a Form S-1 or Form F-1 filed for a
SPAC’s initial public offering, in view of, among other things, the sponsor’s control over
the SPAC and the sponsor’s role in preparing these registration statements? Would such
 145 In this regard, we note that the target company’s directors and executive officers are the parties most similarly
situated to the directors and officers of a private company conducting a traditional initial public offering, in terms of
their knowledge of, and background in, the company going public through a de-SPAC transaction.
78
a requirement be consistent with the Commission’s approach in requiring a majority of
the board of directors of any corporate general partner to sign a registration statement
when the registrant is a limited partnership?
69. Should we also adopt corresponding amendments to Form S-1 and Form F-1 in the event
that these forms are used by a SPAC for a de-SPAC transaction?
D. Re-Determination of Smaller Reporting Company Status
Smaller reporting companies are a category of registrants that are eligible for scaled
disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X and in various forms under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act.146 For example, smaller reporting companies are not
required to provide quantitative and qualitative information about market risk pursuant to
Item 305 of Regulation S-K.
147 In general, a smaller reporting company is a company that is not
an investment company, an asset-backed issuer or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is
not a smaller reporting company, and had (1) a public float of less than $250 million, or (2) had
annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for
which audited financial statements are available and either had no public float or a public float of
less than $700 million.148 Smaller reporting company status is determined at the time of filing an
initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of common
equity and is re-determined on an annual basis. Once a company determines that it is not a
 146 See, e.g., 17 CFR 229.10(f) (Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K); Rules 8-01, 8-02, 8-03, 8-07, and 8-08 of Regulation
S-X; Item 1A of Form 10 and Form 10-K; Item 3.02 of Form 8-K. A foreign private issuer is not eligible to use the
scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies unless it uses the forms and rules designated for
domestic issuers and provides financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instruction 2 to Item
10(f); Instruction 2 to definition of “smaller reporting company” in Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule
12b-2.
147 Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K.
148 The definition of “smaller reporting company” is set forth in Securities Act Rule 405, Exchange Act Rule 12b-2
and Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K.
79
smaller reporting company, it will retain this status unless it determines, when making its annual
determination, that its public float was less than $200 million or, alternatively, that its public
float and annual revenues fell under certain thresholds.149
Currently, most SPACs qualify as smaller reporting companies,150 and a post-business
combination company after a de-SPAC transaction is permitted by rule151 to retain this status
until the next annual determination date when a SPAC is the legal acquirer of the private
operating company in a de-SPAC transaction. The absence of a re-determination of smaller
reporting company status upon the completion of these de-SPAC transactions permits certain
post-business combination companies to avail themselves of scaled disclosure and other
accommodations when they otherwise would not have qualified as a smaller reporting company
had they become public companies through a traditional initial public offering.
In view of the informational asymmetries that result when a private operating company
chooses to go public through such a de-SPAC transaction and the increasing prevalence of these
transactions as a vehicle for private operating companies to become reporting companies under
the Exchange Act, we are proposing to require a re-determination of smaller reporting company
status following the consummation of a de-SPAC transaction. As proposed, this redetermination of smaller reporting company status would occur prior to the time the postbusiness combination company makes its first Commission filing, other than the Form 8-K with
Form 10 information,152 with the public float threshold measured as of a date within four
business days after the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction and the revenue threshold
 149 See Item 10(f)(2)(iii) of Regulation S-K; Securities Act Rule 405; Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.
150 See infra Section IX.B.2.f.
151 See Item 10(f)(2) of Regulation S-K; Securities Act Rule 405; Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.
152 A Form 8-K with Form 10 information is filed pursuant to Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and/or 9.01(c) of the form.
80
determined by using the annual revenues of the private operating company as of the most
recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.
153 The
applicable thresholds in the current definition would remain unchanged.
The proposed four-business day window to calculate the public float threshold following
a de-SPAC transaction would end on the due date for the Form 8-K with Form 10 information
that a post-business combination company is required to file after the completion of a de-SPAC
transaction. The proposed four-business day period would provide some flexibility for issuers to
measure public float, compared to the annual re-determination of smaller reporting company
status,
154 and would allow for a more accurate reflection of a post-business combination
company’s public float, in view of the limited trading history of the common equity securities of
the post-business combination company following a de-SPAC transaction.
We are proposing to require a post-business combination company to reflect this
re-determination of smaller reporting company status in its first periodic report (Form 10-K or
Form 10-Q) following a de-SPAC transaction, which would provide the post-business
combination company with time to prepare for any loss of the scaled disclosure and other
accommodations available to smaller reporting companies.
155 As proposed, a post-business
 153 Proposed Item 10(f)(2)(iv) and the proposed amendments to the definition of “smaller reporting company” in
Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. The float determination would be required to precede the
first Commission filing after the Form 8-K with Form 10 information.
154 In re-determining smaller reporting company status annually, a registrant is required to measure its public float
as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
155 For example, as proposed, a post-business combination company would be required to re-determine whether it
qualifies as a smaller reporting company, using the initial qualification thresholds in the definition, prior to the time
the company makes its first Commission filing (e.g., a Form 8-K, registration statement or periodic report) after the
filing of a Form 8-K with Form 10 information, with its public float measured as of a date within four business days
after the completion of the de-SPAC transaction. The company would not be required to reflect this redetermination of smaller reporting company status in any Commission filing until it files its first periodic report
(Form 10-K or Form 10-Q) following the de-SPAC transaction. Thus, if a SPAC qualified as a smaller reporting
company before a de-SPAC transaction and was the legal acquirer in the de-SPAC transaction, the post-business
combination company would continue to be able to rely on the scaled disclosure accommodations for smaller
81
combination company that fails to qualify for smaller reporting company status after a de-SPAC
transaction would remain unqualified until its next annual re-determination of this status.
Request for Comment
70. As proposed, the re-determination of smaller reporting company status must be based on
public float measured as of a date within four business days after the consummation of
the de-SPAC transaction and the annual revenues of the private operating company as of
the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are
available. Should we require the re-determination of smaller reporting company status
upon the completion of a de-SPAC transaction, as proposed? Should public float be
determined within a different time frame (e.g., 30 days) or through a different method
(e.g., as the average over a certain period)? Should the annual revenues of the private
operating company be used in determining whether the revenue threshold has been met,
as proposed?
71. Should we require a post-business combination company following a de-SPAC
transaction to reflect the re-determination of smaller reporting company status in its next
periodic report, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a post-business
combination company to reflect the re-determination of smaller reporting company status
at an earlier or later point in time after the completion of a de-SPAC transaction, such as
in the first periodic report that covers the period in which the de-SPAC transaction
occurred (e.g., when a de-SPAC transaction is completed after the end of a fiscal year but
prior to the due date of the Form 10-K for that fiscal year)? Should we provide an

reporting companies when filing a registration statement between the re-determination date and the post-business
combination company’s first periodic report.
82
accommodation if a de-SPAC transaction is completed close in time to the due date for
the registrant’s first periodic report?
72. To the extent that a post-business combination company no longer qualifies for smaller
reporting company status as a result of the proposed re-determination of this status
following a de-SPAC transaction, would the proposed re-determination make it more
difficult for such a company to file a registration statement after the filing of its first
periodic report that complies with the disclosure requirements applicable to non-smaller
reporting companies? If so, should we provide any accommodations for this scenario?
73. Should we make any additional changes with respect to re-determining smaller reporting
company status after the completion of a de-SPAC transaction? For example, should we
replace the public float test with a revenue test for this purpose? Should we provide any
guidance with respect to how to apply this proposal?
74. Should we similarly require a re-determination of emerging growth company status,
accelerated filer status, large accelerated filer status and/or foreign private issuer status
upon the completion of a de-SPAC transaction?
E. PSLRA Safe Harbor
The PSLRA provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, under which a company is protected from liability for forwardlooking statements in any private right of action under the Securities Act or Exchange Act when,
among other things, the forward-looking statement is identified as such and is accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements.156 The safe harbor is not available, however, when a forward-
 156 Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The PSLRA does not impact the
Commission’s ability to bring enforcement actions relating to forward-looking statements.
83
looking statement is made in connection with an offering by a blank check company or an initial
public offering.
157
For purposes of the safe harbor, the term “blank check company” and certain other
terms158 “have the meanings given those terms by rule or regulation of the Commission.”159 The
Commission has defined the term “blank check company” for purposes of and in Rule 419 as a
development stage company that is issuing “penny stock,” as defined in Exchange Act Rule
3a51-1, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan
is to merge with or acquire an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person.
160
This definition, which has not been amended since it was adopted by the Commission in 1992,
predates the enactment of the PSLRA in 1995. SPACs that raise more than $5 million in a firm
commitment underwritten initial public offering are excluded from this definition of “blank
check company” because they are not selling “penny stock.”161
Projections of the private operating company’s performance are typically prepared and
disclosed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction. Some market participants are of the view
that the PSLRA safe harbor for forward-looking statements is available in de-SPAC transactions
when a SPAC is not a blank check company under Rule 419 and thus may not exercise the same
level of care in preparing forward-looking statements, such as projections, as in a traditional

available for an offering by a penny stock issuer, a roll-up transaction, a going private transaction, an offering by a
partnership or a limited liability company, a tender offer, or an offering by an issuer convicted of specified securities
law violations or subject to certain injunctive or cease and desist actions.

initial public offering.
162 As noted above, a number of commentators have raised concerns about
the use of projections that they believe to be unreasonable in de-SPAC transactions.
163
To address concerns about the use of forward-looking statements, such as projections, in
connection with de-SPAC transactions, and pursuant to the statutory authority under the PSLRA
to define “blank check company” by Commission rule or regulation, we are proposing to amend
the definition of “blank check company” for purposes of the PSLRA to remove the “penny
stock” condition and to define the term as “a company that has no specific business plan or
purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an
unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person.”164 As discussed above, private
companies are increasingly using de-SPAC transactions as a mechanism to become public
companies. For purposes of the PSLRA, we see no reason to treat forward-looking statements
made in connection with de-SPAC transactions differently than forward-looking statements
made in traditional initial public offerings, in that both instances involve private issuers entering
the public U.S. securities markets for the first time and similar informational asymmetries that
exist between these issuers (and their insiders and early investors) and public investors.
Moreover, we see no reason to treat blank check companies differently for purposes of the
PSLRA safe harbor depending on whether they raise more than $5 million in a firm commitment
underwritten initial public offering and thus are not selling penny stock.
 162 See, e.g., Matt Levine, Money Stuff: Maybe SPACs Are Really IPOs, Bloomberg, Apr. 12, 2021; Eliot Brown,
Electric-Vehicle Startups Promise Record-Setting Revenue Growth, The Wall Street Journal, Mar. 15, 2021; Public
Statement on SPACs, IPOs and Liability Risk under the Securities Laws (Division of Corporation Finance, Apr. 8,
2021).
163 See supra note 33.
164 We are also proposing to amend the definition to remove the reference to “development stage company” because
the reference would be unnecessary for purposes of the proposed definition.
85
Amending the definition of “blank check company” in this manner would clarify that the
statutory safe harbor in the PSLRA is not available for forward-looking statements, such as
projections, made in connection with de-SPAC transactions involving an offering of securities by
a SPAC or other issuer that meets the definition of “blank check company” as amended, such
that forward-looking statements by SPACs, such as statements regarding the projections of target
private operating companies in these transactions, would not fall under the safe harbor.
165 The
proposed amendment would also eliminate the current overlap in the safe harbor in regard to the
exclusion for offerings by blank check companies and the exclusion for penny stock issuers.166
To avoid multiple definitions for the term “blank check company,” we are proposing to amend
Rule 419 in a manner that would otherwise retain the current scope of the rule. We are also
proposing to amend the references to “blank check company” in various Securities Act rules to
“blank check company issuing penny stock,” as such term would be defined in Securities Act
Rule 405, to maintain the current scope of these rules.167
Request for Comment
75. Should we define “blank check company” in Rule 405, as proposed? Should we include
a reference in the definition to “development stage company” or the issuance of “penny
stock”? Should we consider other changes to the proposed definition?
 165 Forward-looking statements made by target private operating companies do not fall under the safe harbor,
because the safe harbor is not available to companies that are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act at the time that the statement is made. Further, the safe harbor would not be
available to the subset of shell companies that meet the amended definition of “blank check company” (i.e., that has
no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition
with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person).
166 The exclusion in the safe harbor for offerings by “blank check companies” is subsumed by the exclusion for
penny stock issuers, in that the term “blank check company,” as currently defined in Rule 419, is “a development
stage company that … is issuing ‘penny stock.’”
167 See proposed amendments to Rules 137, 138, 139, 163A, 164, 174, 430B, and 437a. As proposed, the term
“blank check company issuing penny stock” would be defined as a company that is subject to Rule 419. Due to
current Federal Register formatting requirements, we are also proposing technical changes to Rule 163A and
Rule 164 to move the Preliminary Note(s) in these rules to introductory paragraphs of the respective rules.
86
76. Would the proposed amendments improve the quality of projections in connection with
de-SPAC transactions by clarifying that the safe harbor under the PSLRA is unavailable?
Would the proposed amendment discourage some SPACs from disclosing projections in
connection with these transactions or affect the ability of SPACs or target companies to
comply with their obligations under the laws of their jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization to disclose projections used by the board of directors or the companies’
fairness opinion advisers?
77. As an alternative approach, should we issue an interpretation addressing whether a deSPAC transaction is an “initial public offering” for purposes of the PSLRA?
78. Would including the proposed Rule 405 definition of “blank check company” in
Rule 419 create confusion for registrants and investors? Should we consider retaining a
separate definition of “blank check company” for purposes of Rule 419? If so, why?
79. Should we amend the references to “blank check company” in Securities Act Rules 137,
138, 139, 163A, 164, 174, 430B and 437a to refer to “blank check company issuing
penny stock,” as proposed?
80. Should we amend Rule 419 so that some or all of its conditions are applicable to SPACs
that raise more than $5 million in a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering?
If so, which conditions? What would be the advantages and drawbacks of such an
approach? Should we amend the definition of “penny stock” to bring more SPACs
within the scope of Rule 419?
81. Are there other rule amendments we should consider in connection with the PSLRA?

F. Underwriter Status and Liability in Securities Transactions
Underwriters form an essential link in the distribution of securities from an issuer to
investors. The term “underwriter” is broadly defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act to
mean “any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an
issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security, or participates or has a direct or
indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct
or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking.”168 The determination of whether a particular
person is an “underwriter” does not depend on the person’s business but rather on that person’s
relationship to a particular securities offering. Any person whose activities with respect to any
given offering fall within one of the prongs of the Section 2(a)(11) definition is deemed to meet
the statutory definition of underwriter—commonly known as a “statutory underwriter.”169
Congress enacted a broad definition of “underwriter” in order to “include as underwriters all
persons who might operate as conduits for securities being placed into the hands of the investing
public.”170 Correspondingly, the Commission’s longstanding view is that, depending on facts
and circumstances, any person, including an individual investor who is not a professional in the
securities business, can be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act if that
 168 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(11). Section 2(a)(11) states that the term “issuer” shall include, in addition to an issuer, any
person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common
control with the issuer. Therefore, any person who purchased securities from an affiliate of an issuer is an
underwriter under Section 2(a)(11) if that person purchased with a view to the distribution of the securities.
169 See 2 Louis Loss (late), Joel Seligman, and Troy Paredes, Securities Regulation 3.A.3 (6th ed. 2019) (“The term
underwriter is defined not with reference to the particular person’s general business but on the basis of his or her
relationship to the particular offering…. Any person who performs one of the specified functions in relation to the
offering is a statutory underwriter even though he or she is not a broker or dealer.”).
170 Thomas Lee Hazen, The Law of Securities Regulation, section 4:98.
88
person acts as a link in a chain of transactions through which securities are distributed from an
issuer or its control persons to the public.171
As intermediaries between an issuer and the investing public, underwriters play a critical
role as “gatekeepers” to the public markets.172 Historically, in initial public offerings, where the
investing public might be unfamiliar with a particular issuer, financial firms that act as
underwriters would lend their well-known name to support that issuer’s offering. Where public
investors may not have been inclined to invest with the company seeking to conduct a public
offering, they could take comfort in the fact that a large, well-known financial institution, acting
as underwriter, was including its name on the first page of the issuer’s prospectus.173 In
exchange, in a firm commitment underwritten offering, the underwriters earn the “gross spread”

Investment Banking and the New Issues Market, 58 VA. L. REV. 776 (1972) (“The most important function
performed during origination is the selection of candidates for public investment. The decision to underwrite a
particular issue is normally made only after careful investigation of the issuer and evaluation of its prospects. Not
all corporations are able to win sponsorship of proposed flotations, and prestigious underwriters reject many more
candidates than they accept. After initially deciding to sponsor a flotation, the managing underwriter must conduct
another, more intensive investigation into the issuer’s affairs in order to satisfy the duty to conduct a ‘reasonable
investigation’ imposed on underwriters by section 11 of the 1933 Act… [t]he screening and investigative processes
employed in origination should weed out those prospective issuers least likely to make productive use of publicly
invested funds and should identify elements of risk in those issues which are selected and presented to the public.
The successful performance of these functions is important to the protection of investors and to the optimum
allocation of economic resources.”).
173 See, e.g., Harold S. Bloomenthal & Samuel Wolff, Due diligence defenses—Underwriter’s responsibilities and
liabilities, 3B Sec. & Fed. Corp. Law § 12:42 (2d ed.) (“The managing or initiating underwriter plays a critical role
in determining access to capital markets. The decision of a particular investment banking firm to put together an
underwriting syndicate in order to float an issue of securities or to refrain from doing so for a particular issuer
obviously has significance beyond investors since it determines to a degree the shape of our economy. However, it
has specific and immediate significance to members of the investing public in that in large part reliance is being
placed on such underwriters to screen the multitude of issuers seeking access to the capital markets.”).

between the price stated on the cover of the prospectus (the price at which the underwriters will
sell the issuer’s shares to the public for the first time) and the price at which the underwriters are
able to negotiate with the issuer for the initial purchase of the issuer’s shares.174
An underwriter’s participation in an issuer’s offering also exposes the underwriter to
potential liability under the Securities Act. The civil liability provisions of the Securities Act
reflect the unique position underwriters occupy in the chain of distribution of securities and
provide strong incentives for underwriters to take steps to help ensure the accuracy of disclosure
in a registration statement. Section 11 of the Securities Act imposes on underwriters, among
other parties identified in Section 11(a), civil liability for any part of the registration statement, at
effectiveness, which contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, to any person acquiring such security.175 Similarly, Section 12(a)(2) imposes
liability upon anyone, including underwriters, who offers or sells a security, by means of a
prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, to any person purchasing such
security from them.176 These provisions provide significant investor protections to those who
acquire securities sold pursuant to a registration statement by providing tools to hold companies,
underwriters, and other parties accountable for misstatements and omissions in connection with
 174 SPACs initially engage in firm commitment underwritten offerings in order to first sell their securities to the
public. See supra Section I. However, as we further discuss below, the compensation structure for SPAC initial
public offerings is generally different than that in traditional firm commitment offerings because a significant
portion of the compensation is deferred.

public offerings of securities.177 As a result, anyone who might be named as a potential
defendant in these suits has strong incentives to take the necessary steps to avoid such liability.
One defense available to an underwriter in a distribution is the “due diligence” defense,
which shields an underwriter from liability if it can establish that, after reasonable investigation,
the underwriter had reasonable ground to believe and did believe, at the time the registration
statement became effective, that the statements therein were true and that there was no omission
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading.178 To establish its “due diligence” defense, an underwriter must establish that it
exercised reasonable care in verifying the statements in the registration statement. Underwriters
in a traditional initial public offering are therefore motivated to take the investigative steps
necessary to establish the “due diligence” defense.179 The statutory provision of a due diligence
defense appears to reflect an intent to improve the standards of conduct to which persons
associated with the distribution of securities are to be held by imposing upon them standards of
“honesty, care, and competence.”180 It was believed that the imposition of civil liability under

177 See William O. Douglas & George E. Bates, The Federal Securities Act of 1933, 43 YALE L.J.171 (1933) (“The
civil liabilities imposed by the Act are not only compensatory in nature but also in terrorem. They have been set
high to guarantee that the risk of their invocation will be effective in assuring that the ‘truth about securities’ will be
told.”).
178 See Section 11(b)(3) of the Securities Act. [15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3).].
179 Similarly, Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act provides a defense for defendants who, in the exercise of
“reasonable care,” could not have known of the alleged misstatement or omission (15 U.S.C. 77l(a)(2)). Courts
generally have construed these two defenses similarly. See, e.g., In re WorldCom Inc. Sec. Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d
628, 663-64 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).
180 H.R. No. 85, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. (1933) (From the Introductory Statement to the Report submitted by Mr.
Rayburn, Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce: “Honesty, care, and competence are the demands of
trusteeship. These demands are made by the bill on the directors of the issues, its experts, and the underwriters who
sponsor the issue. If it be said that the imposition of such responsibilities upon these persons will be to alter
corporate organization and corporate practice in this country, such a result is only what your committee expects.”).
91
the Securities Act upon participants in a distribution would cause them to exercise the care
necessary to assure the accuracy of the statements in the registration statement.181
Consistent with this intent, the Commission has stated that the due diligence efforts
performed by underwriters are central to the integrity of our disclosure system.182 The investing
public relies on underwriters to “screen the multitude of issuers seeking access to the capital
markets” and expects them to verify the accuracy of the information in the registration
statement.183 Moreover, although the Securities Act does not expressly require an underwriter to
conduct a due diligence investigation, the Commission has long expressed the view that
underwriters nonetheless have an affirmative obligation to conduct reasonable due diligence.184
The Commission has stated that “an underwriter [in a securities offering] impliedly represents
that he has made such an investigation [of the accuracy of the information in the registration
statement] in accordance with professional standards” and “[i]nvestors properly rely on this

with the distribution of securities to “exercise the ‘honesty, care and competence’ necessary to assure the accuracy
of the [s]tatements in the registration statement”).

substantial accuracy of representations made in the prospectus and other sales literature.”); In re Brown, Barton &
Engel, 41 SEC 59, at 64 (June 8, 1962) (“[I]n undertaking a distribution . . . [the underwriter] had a responsibility to

added protection which has a direct bearing on their appraisal of the reliability of the
representations in the prospectus.”185
1. Participants in a Distribution as “Underwriters”
Common interpretations of the underwriter definition in Section 2(a)(11) traditionally
have focused on the words “with a view to” in the phrase “purchased from an issuer with a view
to ... distribution.” Thus, an investment banking firm that arranges with an issuer for the public
sale of its securities is clearly an “underwriter.” However, as noted above, the statutory
definition of underwriter is much broader. Both federal courts and the Commission previously
have found that other parties involved in securities offerings can be deemed “statutory
underwriters” under the underwriter definition, such as by selling “for an issuer;”186 and/or
 185 In the Matter of the Richmond Corp., Release No. 33-4584 (Feb. 27, 1963). See also In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec.
Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d 628, 684 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Underwriters … have special access to information about an
issuer at a critical time in the issuer’s corporate life, at a time it is seeking to raise capital. The public relies on the
underwriter to obtain and verify relevant information and then make sure that essential facts are disclosed.”);
Sanders v. John Nuveen & Co., Inc., 524 F.2d 1064, 1069–70 (7th Cir. 1975) (“An underwriter’s relationship with
the issuer gives the underwriter access to facts that are not equally available to members of the public who must rely
on published information. And the relationship between the underwriter and its customers implicitly involves a
favorable recommendation of the issued security. Because the public relies on the integrity, independence and
expertise of the underwriter, the underwriter’s participation significantly enhances the marketability of the security.
And since the underwriter is unquestionably aware of the public’s reliance on his participation in the sale of the
issue, the mere fact that he has underwritten it is an implied representation that he has met the standards of his
profession in his investigation of the issuer.”); Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341,
370 (2d Cir. 1973) (“No greater reliance in our self-regulatory system is placed on any single participant in the
issuance of securities than upon the underwriter. He is most heavily relied upon to verify published materials
because of his expertise in appraising the securities issue and the issuer, and because of his incentive to do so. He is
familiar with the process of investigating the business condition of a company and possesses extensive resources for
doing so…. Prospective investors look to the underwriter … to pass on the soundness of the security and the
correctness of the registration statement and prospectus.”); Escott v. BarChris Const. Corp., 283 F. Supp. 643, 697
(S.D.N.Y. 1968) (“The purpose of Section 11 is to protect investors. To that end the underwriters are made
responsible for the truth of the prospectus.”).
186 See SEC v. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, 120 F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1941) (charitable association
deemed a statutory underwriter in promoting the sale of war bonds, collecting funds and distributing the securities to
its members notwithstanding the charitable association’s lack of a relationship with the issuer of the bonds); SEC v.
Kern, 425 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2005). See also Release No. 33-5223, supra note 171 (stating that any persons may be
underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) “if they act as links in a chain of transactions through which
securities move from an issuer to the public…. the Commission hereby emphasizes and draws attention to the fact
that the statutory language of Section 2[(a)](11) is in the disjunctive. Thus, it is insufficient to conclude that a
person is not an underwriter solely because he did not purchase securities from an issuer with a view to their
distribution. It must also be established that the person is not offering or selling for an issuer in connection with the
93
directly or indirectly “participating” in a distribution by engaging in activities “necessary to the
distribution”187 or in “distribution-related activities.”188 Such parties can attain underwriter
status even if they do not receive compensation for their services,189 do not sell securities directly
to the public,190 and do not have privity of contract with the issuer.191 Similarly, courts have
interpreted the underwriter definition broadly to include promoters, officers, and control persons
who have arranged for public trading of an unregistered security or have stimulated investor
interest in such security through advertisements, research reports, or other promotional efforts.192
Moreover, the Commission has stated that “there is nothing in Section 2[(a)](11) which places a
 distribution of the securities and that the person does not participate or have a participation in any such undertaking,
and does not participate or have a participation in the underwriting of any such undertaking.”).
187 See, e.g., Harden v. Raffensperger, Hughes & Co., 65 F.3d 1392 (7th Cir. 1995) (third party retained as a
“qualified independent underwriter” to perform due diligence and recommend a minimum yield for a bond offering
deemed a statutory underwriter). The defendant argued that it was not an underwriter because it had neither
purchased nor sold any of the distributed securities. The court held that the defendant’s activities fell within the
“participates” and “has a participation” language of Section 2(a)(11), reasoning that Section 2(a)(11) is broad
enough to encompass all persons who engage in the steps necessary to the distribution of securities.
188 See, e.g., Geiger v. SEC, 363 F.3d 481, 487 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (defendant “participated” in a distribution as a
statutory underwriter through its actions in finding a buyer, negotiating the terms of the transaction, and facilitating
the resale of securities).
189 See, e.g., Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, supra note 186, at 740 (“The solicitation of offers to
buy the unregistered bonds, either with or without compensation, brought defendant’s activities literally within the
prohibition of the statute.”); see also J. William Hicks, 7A Exempted Trans. Under Securities Act 1933 § 9:39
(citing the Brief for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association:
“The legislative history of Section 2[(a)](11) makes it apparent that Congress did not intend to require the elements
of compensation or a contract with the issuer in order to make a distributor of securities an underwriter. In an earlier
draft of the Securities Act, which was considered by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the
definition of underwriter … would have made the underwriting relationship depend upon the receipt of
compensation. In abandoning that definition and adopting the definition which is included in the bill as enacted,
Congress showed a clear intention of extending the term to include all persons who sell for an issuer, whether or not
they do so for profit.”).

either case, the solicitation was equally for the benefit of the Chinese government and broadly speaking was for the
issuer in connection with the distribution of the bonds.”).

time limit on a person’s status as an underwriter” because the “public has the same need for
protection afforded by registration whether the securities are distributed shortly after their
purchase or after a considerable length of time.”193
2. The De-SPAC Transaction as a “Distribution” of the Combined
Company’s Securities
Underwriter status depends upon a person’s activities occurring “in connection with” a
“distribution” of any security. The Commission has explained that underwriter status under the
“participation” prong of the underwriter definition depends on the putative underwriter “enjoying
substantial relationships with the issuer or underwriter, or engaging in the performance of any
substantial functions in the organization or management of the distribution.”194 The Securities
Act does not define the term “distribution;” however, the federal courts and the Commission
have interpreted the term as synonymous with a “public offering” within the meaning of Section
4(a)(2) of the Act.195 Moreover, a distribution has been said to comprise “the entire process by
which in the course of a public offer [a] block of securities is dispersed and ultimately comes to
rest in the hands of the investing public.”196

The purpose of a SPAC initial public offering is to raise a pool of cash in order to
subsequently merge with a private operating company in a de-SPAC transaction that will convert
the private operating company into a public company. Although the timing of a SPAC initial
public offering and a de-SPAC transaction is bifurcated because a private operating company is
not identified at the SPAC initial public offering stage, the result of a de-SPAC transaction,
however structured, is consistent with that of a traditional initial public offering. The substance
of a de-SPAC transaction is, in many ways, analogous to the distribution that occurs in a
traditional IPO—i.e., a SPAC’s assets consist primarily of highly liquid assets, such as cash and
government securities, and the combined company effectively distributes its securities to public
holders of SPAC shares in exchange for the contribution of the SPAC’s assets to the combined
company. The de-SPAC transaction marks the introduction of the private operating company to
the public capital markets197 and is effectively how the private operating company’s securities
“come to rest” —in other words, are distributed—to public investors as shareholders of the
combined company.198 Accordingly, as in a traditional underwritten initial public offering,
 Matter of Oklahoma-Texas Tr., 2 S.E.C. 764, 769, 1937 WL 32951 (Sept. 23, 1937), aff'd, 100 F.2d 888 (10th Cir.
1939) (finding an ongoing distribution where portions of a registered offering continued to be held by securities
dealers).
197 Such a transaction may take a variety of forms and involve a multitude of issuers. However, the rule we are
proposing would apply to all de-SPAC transactions involving a registered offer of securities.
198 A court has addressed in dicta whether a somewhat analogous situation involving the introduction of private
companies to the public markets through an existing shareholder base was a distribution. See SEC v. Datronics
Engineers, Inc., 490 F.2d 250, 254 (4th Cir. 1973), cert denied, 416 U.S. 937 (1974) wherein Datronics, a public
corporation, acquired a number of privately-held, target companies in merger transactions. A subsidiary of the
defendant would merge with the target company, with the subsidiary surviving the merger. Both the shareholderprincipals of the target and Datronics received stock in the surviving subsidiary. After the merger, Datronics
distributed some of its shares to its shareholders as a dividend. In this way, formerly privately-held companies
became publicly owned without going through a registered public offering. The court stated in dicta, “we think that
Datronics was an underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act. Hence its transactions were covered by the
prohibitions, and were not within the exemptions, of the Act. §§ 3(a)(1) and 4(1) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77c,
77d. By definition, the term underwriter ‘means any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or
offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security, or participates or has a direct or
indirect participation in any such undertaking….’ § 2(11) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77b(11). … By this
underwriter distribution Datronics violated [Section] 5 of the 1933 Act—sale of unregistered securities.”
96
public investors—who were unfamiliar with the formerly private company—would benefit from
the additional care and diligence exercised by SPAC underwriters in connection with the deSPAC transaction.199
3. Proposed Rule: SPAC IPO Underwriters are Underwriters in Registered
De-SPAC Transactions
Proposed Rule 140a would clarify that a person who has acted as an underwriter in a
SPAC initial public offering (“SPAC IPO underwriter”) and participates in the distribution by
taking steps to facilitate the de-SPAC transaction, or any related financing transaction,200 or
otherwise participates (directly or indirectly) in the de-SPAC transaction will be deemed to be
engaged in the distribution of the securities of the surviving public entity in a de-SPAC
transaction within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. Clarifying the
underwriter status of SPAC IPO underwriters in connection with de-SPAC transactions should
motivate them to exercise the care necessary to help ensure the accuracy of the disclosures in
these transactions by affirming that they are subject to Section 11 liability for registered deSPAC transactions.201 In this way, proposed Rule 140a underscores and reinforces that the
liability protections in de-SPAC transactions involving registered offerings have the same effect
as those in underwritten initial public offerings.

199 See Gilligan, Will & Co., supra note 193.
200 Most SPAC deals contain an available cash condition that represents a minimum amount of proceeds below
which the target will not be obligated to consummate the transaction. The cash condition represents a number the
sponsor group believes it can reasonably achieve given their banking syndicate, network, access to capital, and the
target company itself. Since cash in trust is subject to redemption, one mechanism to ensure the cash condition will
be satisfied is to secure commitments for a PIPE investment. See SPAC Research Weekly Newsletter (Oct. 19,
2020), available at https://www.spacresearch.com/newsletter?date=2020-10-19. In addition the staff has observed
that for the vast majority of PIPEs associated with de-SPAC transactions, the closing of the PIPE financing is crossconditioned on the closing of the de-SPAC transaction.
201 Under Section 11, “any person acquiring such security” has a right of recovery. The Commission’s longstanding
view for traditional firm commitment registered offerings is that standing to sue under this provision extends to all
purchasers of securities, whether the purchase occurred in the offering or subsequently in the secondary market. See
Brief of the SEC in DeMaria v. Andersen, 318 F.3d 170 (2d Cir. 2003).
97
As described above, the purpose of a SPAC’s initial public offering is to facilitate a
subsequent de-SPAC transaction, and for target companies merging with a SPAC, the de-SPAC
transaction is the means chosen, out of the several avenues available under the securities laws,
for a private operating company to go public. It is the method by which the target company’s
securities, as securities of the combined company, are distributed into the hands of public
investors. Although SPAC IPO underwriters typically are not retained to act as firm
commitment underwriters in the de-SPAC transaction, they nevertheless typically participate in
activities that are necessary to that distribution.202 For instance, it is common for a SPAC IPO
underwriter (or its affiliates) to participate in the de-SPAC transaction as a financial advisor to
the SPAC, and engage in activities necessary to the completion of the de-SPAC distribution such
as assisting in identifying potential target companies, negotiating merger terms, or finding
investors for and negotiating PIPE investments. Furthermore, receipt of compensation in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction could constitute direct or indirect participation in the
de-SPAC transaction. While SPAC IPO underwriting fees—those fees the SPAC IPO
underwriters earn for their efforts in connection with the initial offering of SPAC shares to the
public—generally range between 5% and 5.5% of IPO proceeds, a significant portion (typically
3.5% of IPO proceeds) is deferred until, and conditioned upon, the completion of the de-SPAC
transaction.203 A SPAC IPO underwriter therefore typically has a strong financial interest in
taking steps to ensure the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction.204 For these reasons,
 202 See generally Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, supra note 186 and accompanying text.
203 See Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17. It is not necessary, however, for a SPAC IPO underwriter to
derive a pecuniary benefit from the distribution in order for Section 2(a)(11) to apply. See Brief for the SEC at 19,
Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, supra note 186 (“The legislative history of Section 2[(a)](11) makes
it apparent that Congress did not intend to require the elements of compensation or a contract with the issuer in order
to make a distributor of securities an underwriter.”)
204 See Robert J. Haft, Peter M. Fass, Michele Haft Hudson, and Arthur F. Haft, Tax-Advantaged Securities,
Overview of SPACs § 6:134.60.
98
proposed Rule 140a would clarify that the SPAC IPO underwriter is an underwriter with respect
to the distribution that occurs in the de-SPAC transaction, when it takes steps to facilitate the deSPAC transaction, or any related financing transaction, or otherwise participates (directly or
indirectly) in the de-SPAC transaction.
We note that proposed Rule 140a addresses the underwriter status of only the SPAC IPO
underwriter in the context of a de-SPAC transaction. In addition, we have discussed above some
of the activities that are sufficient to establish that the SPAC IPO underwriter is participating in
the distribution of target company securities. This discussion, however, is not intended to
provide an exhaustive assessment of underwriter status in the SPAC context, and neither is it
intended to limit the definition of underwriter for purposes of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities
Act. Federal courts and the Commission may find that other parties involved in securities
distributions, including other parties that perform activities necessary to the successful
completion of de-SPAC transactions, are “statutory underwriters” within the definition of
underwriter in Section 2(a)(11). For example, financial advisors, PIPE investors, or other
advisors, depending on the circumstances, may be deemed statutory underwriters in connection
with a de-SPAC transaction if they are purchasing from an issuer “with a view to” distribution,
are selling “for an issuer,” and/or are “participating” in a distribution.
Request for Comment
82. Should we adopt a definition of distribution in Rule 140a, as proposed?
83. Does the current regulatory regime provide sufficient incentives for participants in a deSPAC transaction to conduct appropriate due diligence on the target private operating
company and the disclosures provided to public investors in connection with the deSPAC transaction? Would proposed Rule 140a likely result in improved diligence of
99
private company targets in de-SPAC transactions and related disclosure? Would the
other measures we are proposing in this release mitigate the need for proposed Rule
140a?
84. Does the SPAC IPO underwriter have the means and access necessary (via contract or
otherwise) to perform due diligence at the de-SPAC transaction stage, particularly where
the SPAC IPO underwriter is not retained as an advisor in the de-SPAC transaction or the
target is the registrant for the de-SPAC transaction? Could such access be reasonably
obtained in the course of the negotiation of the underwriting agreement for the SPAC
initial public offering or otherwise?
85. Will shareholders after the de-SPAC transaction have difficulty recovering against SPAC
IPO underwriters liable under Securities Act Section 11 due to potential challenges in
tracing the shares they hold to an effective registration statement for the de-SPAC
transaction? Are there steps we should take to address the challenges shareholders might
face in tracing their shares to such a registration statement? For example, should we
consider rulemaking to define “any person acquiring such security” under Securities Act
Section 11 in the context of de-SPAC transactions and, if so, how should it be defined?
86. Should we limit the application of proposed Rule 140a to situations in which the SPAC
IPO underwriter takes steps to facilitate the de-SPAC transaction, or any related
financing transaction, or otherwise participates (directly or indirectly) in the de-SPAC
transaction, as proposed?
87. Would a determination that SPAC IPO underwriters are engaged in a distribution of the
private operating company’s securities, as proposed, raise additional issues we should
address? For example, does it raise questions about when the SPAC IPO underwriters’
100
participation in the SPAC initial public offering distribution is completed for purposes of
calculating the restricted period under Regulation M?
88. As noted above, there may be additional parties that are involved in a de-SPAC
transaction that may fall within the statutory definition of underwriter because they are
“participating in the distribution” of the target private operating company’s securities to
the public. Should proposed Rule 140a be expanded to expressly include such other
parties? If so, which parties? Should the rule instead deem any party playing a
significant role at the de-SPAC transaction stage to be an underwriter? Should the
Commission provide additional guidance as to which additional parties may be
underwriters and what activities or other considerations would be relevant to determining
whether a party falls within the statutory definition of underwriter in a de-SPAC
transaction?
89. Is it clear what parties would be considered a SPAC IPO underwriter for purposes of
proposed Rule 140a? Should we limit underwriter status as clarified by Rule 140a to the
entities acting as traditional underwriter in a SPAC IPO? Are there other parties that
should be specifically excluded from the application of the rule?
90. Are there alternative approaches we should consider that would enhance the incentives of
participants in a de-SPAC transaction to assure the accuracy of the disclosures provided
to public investors in connection with the de-SPAC transaction and/or align liability
protections for investors across the various avenues for private operating companies to go
public?

IV. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INVOLVING SHELL COMPANIES
In response to concerns regarding the use of shell companies205 as a means of accessing
the U.S. capital markets, and as discussed more fully below, we are proposing new rules that
would apply to business combination transactions involving shell companies, which include deSPAC transactions. First, we are proposing new Rule 145a under the Securities Act that would
deem such business combination transactions to involve a sale of securities to a reporting shell
company’s shareholders. Second, we are proposing new Article 15 of Regulation S-X and
related amendments to more closely align the required financial statements of private operating
companies in connection with these transactions with those required in registration statements on
Form S-1 or F-1 for an initial public offering.206 The issues we are addressing with these rule
proposals are common to these shell company transactions, regardless of whether the shell
company is a SPAC.
A. Shell Company Business Combinations and the Securities Act of 1933
1. Shell Company Business Combinations
SPAC initial public offerings and business combinations occurred with increased
frequency in 2020 and 2021,207 but a business combination with a reporting shell company208 is
 205 As stated above, throughout this release, we use “shell company” and “reporting shell company” in lieu of the
phrase “shell company, other than a business combination related shell company” and “reporting shell company,
other than a business combination related shell company.” See supra note 43 for the definition of “reporting shell
company.”
206 The requirements in Form S-4, Form F-4, and Schedule 14A for an acquisition of a business were developed at a
time when acquirers were generally operating companies, and these requirements do not specifically address
transactions involving shell companies. For example, Form S-4 was adopted by the Commission in 1985, which
predates the origins of SPACs in the 1990s. See Business Combination Transactions-Adoption of Registration
Form, Release No. 33-6578 (Apr. 23, 1985) [50 FR 19001 (May 6, 1985)].
207 See supra notes 7 and 8 regarding the 2020-2021 increase in popularity of SPACs as a means for private
companies to access the public markets.
208 See supra note 9.
102
not a new means for a private company to become a U.S. public company with an Exchange Act
reporting obligation.
209 Historically, private companies have utilized shell companies in various
forms of transactions,210 such as spin-offs, reverse mergers, and de-SPAC transactions to become
U.S. public companies,
211 in many cases without filing a Securities Act registration statement.212
Due to abuses involving shell company transactions, over the years the Commission has adopted
various rules and limitations intended to address the misuse of shell companies.213 For example:
 209 See generally, Ronald M. Shapiro and Laurence M. Katz, The “Going Public through the Back Door”
Phenomenon—An Assessment, 29 MD. L. REV. 320 (1969); Leib Orlanski, Going Public through the Backdoor and
the Shell Game, 58 VA. L. REV. 1451 (1972) (both describing various ways of combining with a public shell
company as a method to bring private corporations public).
210 Shell company business combinations can take many forms. They can be as simple in structure as a statutory
merger, with a private operating company merging with and into a shell company that has previously filed a Form
10 with the Commission, or as complex as a de-SPAC transaction involving multiple merging entities, tax blockers,
and/or a new holding company. Among de-SPAC transactions, the Commission staff has observed a number of
variations, only some of which are consistently registered transactions. For example, in de-SPAC transactions
structured as share exchanges, securities can be offered and sold to the public holders of SPAC securities from the
target, a new holding company, or they can retain their interests in the reporting SPAC.
211 These transactions generally can take the form of either a “reverse merger” in which the private business merges
into the shell company, with the shell company surviving and the former shareholders of the private business
controlling the surviving entity or, in another common type of transaction, a “back door registration,” the shell
company merges into the formerly private company, with the formerly private company surviving and the
shareholders of the shell company becoming shareholders of the surviving entity. See Use of Form S-8, Form 8-K,
and Form 20-F by Shell Companies, Release No. 33-8587 (July 15, 2005) [70 FR 42234 (July 21, 2005)] (“Shell
Company Adopting Release”). Both alternatives transform a private company into a public company by combining
directly or indirectly with a public company (whether through a merger, exchange offer, or otherwise).
212 For example, unregistered transactions can involve a direct or indirect offer and sale of the public shell’s
securities to holders of the target entity’s securities in consideration for their interests in the target entity. The public
shell is then the entity that survives the business combination. In the context of SPACs, where there is no
registration statement, transactions are typically disclosed to the SPAC’s public shareholders in a proxy or
information statement if there is a vote or consents being solicited, or otherwise in a Schedule TO. In shell company
mergers where there is no vote, the shell company’s shareholders may only learn about the transaction when the
shell company files an Item 5.06 Form 8-K to report a change in shell company status. With respect to de-SPAC
transactions, the Commission staff has observed that in 2020 (Sept. 30, 2019 to Oct. 1, 2020), 21 de-SPAC
transactions were registered on Form S-4 or F-4 and 16 were disclosed on proxy or information statements soliciting
shareholder votes or consents, respectively. Over the same months in 2021, 212 de-SPAC transactions were
registered on Form S-4 or F-4 and 48 were disclosed on proxy or information statements.
213 We note that these rules and limitations generally do not apply to shell companies that qualify as “business
combination related shell companies” as defined in Rule 405. See infra Section IV.A.3.
103
• Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by either reporting
or non-reporting shell companies;214
• Shell companies are not permitted to use Form S-8;
215
• Shell companies are considered ineligible issuers that cannot use free writing
prospectuses for communications during a registered offering;
216 and
• Broker-dealers are able to rely on the “piggyback” exception to publish quotations for
shell companies for only 18 months following the initial priced quotation on OTC
Markets.217
Although many of these rules address concerns related to market manipulation and penny stock
fraud, the Commission also has previously expressed concerns about the use of a shell company
to distribute securities to the public without the protections afforded by the Securities Act
including, where required, a registration statement.218 The lack of a registration statement could
deprive investors of the critical disclosures and protections that come with Securities Act
registration.
219 The use of shell companies to complete business combinations can thus also
provide companies with opportunities to avoid the disclosure, liability, and other provisions
 214 See 17 CFR 230.144(i), 17 CFR 230.145(c) and (d), and Revisions to Rules 144 and 145, Release No. 33-8869

Release”).

applicable in traditional registered offerings.220 These concerns are still present when shell
companies are used in business combinations to provide private companies with access to the
public markets.
2. Proposed Rule 145a
The substantive reality of a reporting shell company221 business combination with a
company that is not a shell company is that reporting shell company investors have effectively
exchanged their security representing an interest in the reporting shell company for a new
security representing an interest in the combined operating company. As noted above, however,
unlike investors in transaction structures in which the Securities Act applies and a registration
statement would be filed (absent an exemption), investors in reporting shell companies may not
always receive the disclosures and other protections afforded by the Securities Act at the time the
change in the nature of their investment occurs due to the business combination involving
another entity that is not a shell company.
Under the Securities Act, all offers and sales of securities must either be registered or be
exempt from registration, and any offer or sale that is not registered or exempt violates
Section 5.
222 Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act defines a “sale” as, among other things,
 220 For example, in SEC v. M & A W., Inc., 538 F.3d 1043, 1053 (9th Cir. 2008), the court considered a civil
enforcement action against an individual engaged in the business of assisting private corporations to become
publicly-traded companies through reverse merger transactions with reporting shell companies, alleging the sale of
unregistered securities. The court noted: “[W]e are informed by the purpose of registration, which is ‘to protect
investors by promoting full disclosure of information thought necessary to informed investment decisions.’ The
express purpose of the reverse mergers at issue in this case was to transform a private corporation into a corporation
selling stock shares to the public, without making the extensive public disclosures required in an initial offering.
Thus, the investing public had relatively little information about the former private corporation. In such
transactions, the investor protections provided by registration requirements are especially important.”).
221 See supra note 43 for a definition of this term.
222 15 U.S.C. 77e.
105
“every contract of sale or disposition of a security or interest in a security, for value.”223 In view
of the remedial purpose of the Securities Act, courts and the Commission have broadly
interpreted this term, particularly with respect to the creation of a public market in shares of a
private company.224 Moreover, the Commission has concluded that certain business
combination and other transactions involve a sale of securities within the meaning of Section
2(a)(3).
225
Due to the significant increase in reporting shell company business combination
transactions as a means to enter the U.S. capital markets, including through the use of a SPAC,
and in an effort to provide reporting shell company shareholders with more consistent Securities
Act protections regardless of transaction structure, we are proposing new Rule 145a226 that
would deem any business combination of a reporting shell company227 involving another entity
that is not a shell company to involve a sale of securities to the reporting shell company’s
 223 15 U.S.C. 77b(3).
224 In this regard, the Supreme Court has stated that securities legislation, enacted for the purpose of avoiding
frauds, is to be construed “not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.” SEC v.
Cap. Gains Rsch. Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S. Ct. 275, 284–85 (1963). See also SEC v. Harwyn Indus.
Corp., 326 F. Supp. 943, 954 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (construing “value” in Section 2(a)(3) to include the creation of a
public market in the shares with its resulting benefits to the defendants, the court stated, “…[W]e must look to its
overall purpose, which is to provide adequate disclosure to members of the investing public, rather than engage in
strangulating literalism.”); SEC v. Datronics Engineers, Inc., 490 F.2d 250, 254 (4th Cir. 1973), cert denied, 416
U.S. 937 (1974); In the Matter of UniversalScience.com, Inc., Release No. 33-7879 (Aug. 8, 2000) (distribution of
securities as purported “free stock” constituted a sale because it was a disposition for value, the “value” arising “by
virtue of the creation of a public market for the issuer’s securities.”); and Thomas Lee Hazen, The Law of Securities
Regulation § 12:22 (“Concepts of purchase and sale are to be construed flexibly in order to accomplish the purpose
of the securities laws. The courts will consider the economic reality of the transaction and whether it lends itself to
fraud in the making of an investment decision.”).

219 (Rule 145 deems the submission to a vote of stockholders of a proposal for certain mergers, consolidations, or
reclassifications of securities or transfers of assets to involve a “sale,” “offer,” “offer to sell,” or “offer for sale” of

shareholders.
228 It is our preliminary view that such a transaction would be “a disposition of a
security or interest in a security… for value,”229 regardless of the form or structure deployed, and
regardless of whether a shareholder vote or consent is solicited.
230 By deeming such transactions
to be a “sale” for the purposes of the Securities Act, the proposed rule is intended to address
potential disparities in the disclosure and liability protections available to reporting shell
company shareholders depending on the transaction structure deployed in a reporting shell
company business combination.
Nothing in proposed Rule 145a would prevent or prohibit the use of a valid exemption, if
available, for the deemed sale of securities to the reporting shell company’s shareholders in the
business combination.
231 However, our current view is that Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act,
232 which exempts any securities exchange by an issuer with its existing security holders
exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for
soliciting such exchange, generally would not be available for the sales covered by proposed
Rule 145a. In these circumstances, we believe that the deemed exchange by the reporting shell
company’s existing shareholders for the combined company’s securities should be viewed as part
 228 This expresses our views as to the substance of these transactions for the purposes of the Securities Act. Neither
proposed Rule 145a nor the description in this section is intended to express a view with respect to the treatment of
these transactions under other laws including, but not limited to, state corporate law and the Internal Revenue Code.
229 Although no securities may actually be changing hands, in substance, shareholders in a reporting shell company
merger are effectively exchanging their interests in the shell company for interests in a non-shell company; these
shareholders can be viewed as having surrendered “value” for the purposes of Section 2(a)(3).
230 We note that this rule does not change the conclusion that a merger with a reporting shell company may
constitute the offer and sale of securities to other parties for which registration under the Securities Act or an
exemption would be required. For example, where a SPAC survives the de-SPAC transaction, the SPAC will
frequently issue its securities to shareholders of the private company in exchange for their interests in the private
company. Such a transaction would still require registration or an exemption from registration.
231 We note that even if an exemption applies, if Rule 145a is adopted, investors would have the protections of the
anti-fraud provisions in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the
Exchange Act. [15 U.S.C. 77q; 15 U.S.C. 78j; and 17 CFR 240.10b-5, respectively].
232 15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(9).
107
of the same offering as the exchange of the private company’s securities for their interests in the
combined company.233 As a result, because the exchange would not be exclusively with the
reporting shell company’s existing security holders, Section 3(a)(9) would not be available to
exempt the deemed sale to reporting shell company shareholders in proposed Rule 145a, if
adopted. In addition, we note that Section 3(a)(9) would not be available where a commission or
other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting of participation in the
deemed exchange. This would occur, for example, if a proxy solicitor is compensated to solicit
the approval of the reporting shell company’s shareholders for the business combination.
Given the substance of the transactions that would be covered by new Rule 145a, we are
proposing the rule so that shareholders more consistently receive the full protections of the
Securities Act disclosure and liability provisions in business combinations involving reporting
shell companies, regardless of the transaction structure. Not only would registration in this
context result in enhanced liabilities for signatories to any registration statement and potential
underwriter liability as described elsewhere in this release,234 it would also include liability under
Securities Act Section 11(a)(4) for experts, which include every accountant, engineer, or
appraiser, or any person whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him, who has
with his consent been named as having prepared or certified any part of the registration statement
or as having prepared or certified any report or valuation which is used in connection with the
registration statement.
235 In addition, if the transaction is registered, Rule 145a would, in some
 233 We note that none of the non-exclusive safe harbors in 17 CFR 230.152(b) would be likely to apply. In
particular, the closing of the business combination with the reporting shell company would be simultaneous with the
deemed exchange of reporting shell company securities with its own holders and would therefore not meet the 30-
day safe harbor in 17 CFR 230.152(b)(1).
234 See supra Sections III.C and III.F, respectively.
235 See 15 U.S.C. 77k(a)(4). This would include auditors who opine on the financial statements associated with the
business combination. Depending on the transaction and whether services are provided by other parties, this could
108
cases, provide reporting shell company investors with additional pre-sale disclosure about a
transaction that would significantly alter the nature of their investment.236 In this way, proposed
Rule 145a is consistent with the intent of other rules intended to “inhibit the creation of public
markets in securities of issuers about which adequate current information is not available to the
public.”237 The proposed rule should also eliminate potential regulatory arbitrage opportunities
to avoid disclosure requirements or liability through the use of alternative transaction structures
when combining with a reporting shell company.238
3. Excluded Transactions
We wish to emphasize that proposed Rule 145a would have no impact on business
combinations between two bona fide non-shell entities. However, we note that any reporting
shell company that is made to appear to have, or has cloaked itself as having, more than
“nominal” assets or operations would still be subject to Rule 145a in a business combination
transaction.
239
The Commission has historically recognized the usefulness of shell companies formed
solely to change an entity’s domicile or to effect a business combination transaction.240 As a
 also include, for example, valuation consultants, outside reviewers of management projections, or anyone who
provides a fairness opinion about the transaction.
236 Some public shell company business combinations are not disclosed to investors until after the transaction has
closed. See supra note 212.
237 See Rule 145 Adopting Release, supra note 219.
238 See infra Sections III.F for a discussion of the sources of liability in registered de-SPAC transactions.
239 We reiterate the Commission’s previous position on structuring transactions to avoid shell company status in
adopting the 2005 shell company limitations. See Shell Company Adopting Release, supra note 211, at n.32.
240 See the Supplementary Information to the Shell Company Adopting Release, supra note 211 (“We recognize that
companies and their professional advisors often use shell companies for many legitimate corporate structuring
purposes. Similarly, our definition and use of the term ’shell company’ is not intended to imply that shell companies
are inherently fraudulent. Rather, these rules target regulatory problems that we have identified where shell
companies have been used as vehicles to commit fraud and abuse our regulatory processes.”).
109
result, the Commission has excluded such so-called business combination related shell
companies241 from many of the shell company requirements and prohibitions that have been put
in place to ensure the protection of investors in such companies.242 Consistent with this, the
proposed rule would not apply to reporting shell companies that are business combination related
shell companies as this term is defined in Securities Act Rule 405.243
In addition, we are proposing to exclude the business combination of one shell company
into another shell company from the scope of Rule 145a. Such a business combination would
not amount to a fundamental change in the nature of the reporting shell company shareholder’s
investment unlike a business combination with an entity that is not a shell company.244
Request for Comment
91. Should we adopt Rule 145a as proposed?
92. Should we be seeking to align the required disclosures and liabilities associated with shell
company business combinations among the various available transaction structures in
order to provide reporting shell company investors consistent disclosures and protections
across transaction structures? Are there alternative approaches that would accomplish
this goal?
 241 See supra note 43 for the definition of “business combination related shell company.”
242 See Shell Company Adopting Release, supra note 211.
243 Neither a SPAC nor any such entity formed to facilitate a merger with a SPAC meets the definition of a business
combination related shell company because neither of these entities is a shell company formed solely for the purpose
of changing the corporate domicile solely within the United States or formed solely for the purpose of completing a
business combination transaction among one or more entities other than the shell company, none of which is a shell
company.
244 However, such a business combination may continue to fall within Securities Act Rule 145 because there is a
shareholder vote and the transaction is one to which Rule 145 would apply (e.g., a statutory merger or consolidation
or similar plan or acquisition where the sole purpose of the transaction is not to change an issuer’s domicile solely
within the United States).
110
93. How would the proposed rule affect business combinations involving both SPACs and
non-SPAC reporting shell companies? Would these entities be more likely to register
such transactions?
94. If the deemed sale to reporting shell company shareholders is required to be registered
under the Securities Act pursuant to the proposed amendments, should we provide
guidance with respect to the timing of the effectiveness of such registration statement in
relation to the business combination?
95. Are there other transactions that have purposes or results similar to reporting shell
company business combinations that we should deem to constitute sales? Conversely,
does the proposed rule deem too broad of a set of reporting shell company business
combinations to be sales? For example, should the rule be limited to SPACs?
96. Should proposed Rule 145a be limited to deeming shell company business combinations
“sales” with respect to only reporting shell company shareholders? Are there other
parties whose interest in a shell company would be such that a shell company business
combination should be deemed a sale? For example, holders of securities other than
common shares?
97. Should reporting shell companies be prohibited from relying on the exemption in
Securities Act Section 3(a)(9) in a transaction deemed a sale under proposed Rule 145a?
Should we provide additional guidance on the potential availability or lack of availability
of other exemptions from registration for the proposed Rule 145a sale? If so, what
exemptions should we address?
98. Should we exclude business combination related shell companies from the scope of
proposed Rule 145a, as proposed?
111
99. Should Rule 145a exclude the business combination of one shell company into another
shell company, as proposed? How frequently do such mergers occur in absence of the
proposed Rule 145a? In such a situation, would either or both companies’ shareholders
benefit from registration under the Securities Act?
100. Securities Act Rule 145(a) deems sales within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the
Securities Act for certain transactions submitted for the vote or consent of security
holders. Securities Act Rules 145(c) and (d) include provisions that have the effect of
limiting resales with respect to parties to transactions described in Rule 145(a) and their
affiliates that involve shell companies. Although proposed Rule 145a would apply to all
reporting shell company business combinations, not all of these business combinations
would also fall within Rule 145(a). Should we consider resale limitations for Rule 145a?
Should any such resale limitations be similar to those in existing Rule 145?
101. Should we consider guidance or additional rule amendments for transactions where the
provisions of existing Rule 145 and Rule 145a could overlap? For example, are there any
rules that currently reference Rule 145 that should be amended to apply (or not apply) to
transactions covered by proposed Rule 145a (e.g., Rule 500 of Regulation D, which states
the availability of the exemptions for Rule 145(a) transactions; Securities Act Rule 135,
which allows notice of a registered offering, including for a Rule 145(a) transaction; or
Rule 172, which prohibits the use of access equals delivery in Rule 145(a) transactions)?
What, if any, issues should the Commission address through guidance?
102. Are there other potential opportunities for regulatory arbitrage in shell company or SPAC
transactions that the Commission should consider addressing?
112
B. Financial Statement Requirements in Business Combination Transactions
Involving Shell Companies
After a business combination involving a shell company, the financial statements of the
private operating company become those of the registrant for financial reporting purposes. In
other words, the private operating company becomes the predecessor.245 How the private
operating company chooses to become a public company could affect its financial statement
disclosures due to differences in the requirements of registration statements on Form S-1/F-1 and
the requirements of Form S-4/F-4. In our view, a company’s choice of the manner in which it
goes public should not generally result in substantially different financial statement disclosures
being provided to investors.
We are proposing amendments to our forms, schedules, and rules to more closely align
the financial statement reporting requirements in business combinations involving a shell
company and a private operating company with those in traditional initial public offerings. The
financial statements that would be required under the proposed amendments are based, in part,
on current staff guidance for transactions involving shell companies.246 Codifying this guidance
should reduce any asymmetries between financial statement disclosures in business combination
transactions involving shell companies and traditional initial public offerings. Accordingly, we
are proposing new Article 15 of Regulation S-X and related amendments to address certain
inconsistencies in the reporting of financial information that can arise when applying existing
 245 The term predecessor when used in this section has the same meaning as applied in its use under Regulation S-X
and determination of financial statement requirements.
246 Commission staff has provided informal guidance to address practical questions related to financial reporting
issues for shell company mergers in the Division of Corporation Finance’s Financial Reporting Manual (“FRM”).
The FRM is not a rule, regulation or statement of the Commission, and the Commission has neither approved nor
disapproved its content.
113
requirements to business combination transactions involving shell companies compared to the
financial statement requirements for a Securities Act registration statement.
1. Number of Years of Financial Statements
A registration statement on Form S-4 and F-4 and a proxy or information statement
require financial statements of the target company for the same number of years of financial
statements as would be required by the target in an annual report and any subsequent interim
periods.247 Three years of statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows are required, except in the following scenarios when two years are permitted:
• The target company would qualify as a smaller reporting company;
248
• The target company would be an emerging growth company (“EGC”)249 if it were
conducting an initial public offering of common equity securities and the registrant is an
EGC that has not yet filed or been required to file its first annual report, even if the target
would not be a smaller reporting company;
250 or
• The transaction is registered on a Form F-4 and either (1) the target company is a first
time adopter of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), or (2) the Form F-4 is the initial
registration statement of the private company and it provides U.S. GAAP financial
statements.251
 247 See Items 17(b)(7) and 17(b)(8) of Form S-4; Items 17(b)(5) and 17(b)(6) of Form F-4; Item 14 of Schedule
14A; and Instruction 1 of Schedule 14C.
248 See supra Section III.D.
249 See supra note 112.
250 An EGC is permitted to include two years of statements of comprehensive income in its Securities Act
registration statement for an initial public offering of its common equity securities. EGCs that are not smaller
reporting companies are still required to include three years of statements of comprehensive income in their annual
reports. See Rule 3-02 of Regulation S-X.
251 Item 17(b)(5) of Form F-4; General Instruction G of Form 20-F; and Instruction 3 to Item 8.A.2 of Form 20-F.
114
Our proposed amendments would expand the circumstances in which target companies may
report two years of financial statements under the second bullet above by removing whether or
not the shell company has filed its first annual report as a factor in determining the number of
years required. Because the scenarios described in the first and third bullets above are already
aligned with the financial statements required in a traditional initial public offering, we have not
proposed any changes related to them. In addition, the proposed amendments would not affect
the number of years of statements of comprehensive income that are required for the private
operating company when it exceeds both the smaller reporting company and EGC revenue
thresholds (that is, three years would continue to be required).252 However, to align the reporting
with a traditional initial public offering, the proposed amendments would potentially reduce the
number of years required when the target company would be an EGC if it were conducting an
initial public offering of common equity securities and the registrant is an EGC that has filed or
been required to file its first annual report.
In a traditional initial public offering under the Securities Act, the registrant may provide
two years of statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows when its most recently completed fiscal year revenue is below the smaller reporting
company or EGC revenue thresholds (and all the other EGC qualifications are met), or as noted
in the third scenario above for a foreign private issuer. We are proposing to align the number of

252 See Items 17(b)(7) and 17(b)(8) of Form S-4; Items 17(b)(5) and 17(b)(6) of Form F-4; Item 14 of Schedule
14A; and Instruction 1 of Schedule 14C. In addition to providing three years of financial statements due to the
private operating company not qualifying as an EGC, the private operating company would not be able to take
advantage of the delayed adoption dates for new or revised accounting standards permitted by EGCs in its financial
statements. In the staff’s view, the private operating company’s revenue, as predecessor, should be used to
determine whether the registrant qualifies as an EGC after the transaction. See FAQ 47 of the Division of
Corporation Finance’s Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act Frequently Asked Questions, available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfjjobsactfaq-title-i-general.htm (last revised Dec. 21, 2015). The
FAQ does not represent a rule, regulation or statement of the Commission, and the Commission has neither
approved nor disapproved its content.
115
fiscal years required to be included in the financial statements for a private company that will be
the predecessor(s) in a shell company combination with the financial statements required to be
included in a Securities Act registration statement for an initial public offering of equity
securities in proposed Rule 15-01(b) of Regulation S-X.
Proposed Rule 15-01(b) would provide that when the registrant is a shell company, and
the financial statements of a business253 that will be a predecessor to the registrant are required in
a registration statement or proxy statement, the registrant must file financial statements of the
business that will be a predecessor to the registrant in accordance with § 210.3-01 to 3-12 and
§ 210.10-01 (Articles 3 and 10 of Regulation S-X) or § 210.8-01 to 8-08 (Article 8), if
applicable, as if the filing were a Securities Act registration statement for the initial public
offering of that business’s equity securities. As a result, a shell company registrant would be
permitted to include in its Form S-4/F-4/proxy or information statement two years of statements
of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the private
operating company for all transactions involving an EGC shell company and a private operating
company that would qualify as an EGC, and this determination would not be dependent on
whether the shell company has filed or was already required to file its annual report or not. The
proposed amendments would not affect the number of years of statements of comprehensive
income that are required for the private operating company when it exceeds both the smaller
 253 We use the term business in this context, rather than private operating company, in order to be consistent with
the provisions in Regulation S-X that define and use business, such as Rule 11-01(d) of Regulation S-X. In a
business combination transaction involving a shell company, the private operating company would meet the
definition of a business.
116
reporting company and EGC revenue thresholds (that is, three years would continue to be
required).
254
2. Audit Requirements of Predecessor
Proposed Rule 15-01(a) would align the level of audit assurance required for the target
private operating company in business combination transactions involving a shell company with
the audit requirements for an initial public offering.255 Specifically, we are proposing that the
term audit (or examination), when used in regard to financial statements of a business that is or
will be a predecessor to a shell company, means an examination of the financial statements by an
independent accountant in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB for the purpose of
expressing an opinion thereon. As a result, a target private operating company would be
required to comply with Article 2 of Regulation S-X as if it were filing an initial public offering
for its audited financial statements. Forms S-4 and F-4256 currently provide that, for an
acquisition by a registrant that is not a shell company, (i) the target operating company financial
statements may be audited in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards,257
(ii) the financial statements of the most recent fiscal year are required to be audited only to the
extent practicable,258 and (iii) financial statements before the latest fiscal year need not be
audited if they were not previously audited.259 The staff, however, has advised registrants that it
 254 The private operating company would also not be able to take advantage of the delayed adoption dates for new
or revised accounting standards as that transition is only available to EGC companies. As described in FAQ 47 of
the Division of Corporation Finance’s Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act Frequently Asked Questions, the staff
takes the view that the private operating company’s revenue, as predecessor, will determine the post-transaction
EGC status. See Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B).
255 See proposed Rule 15-01(a) of Regulation S-X and Instruction 1 to Item 17(b) of Form S-4.
256 See Instruction 1 to Item 17(b)(5) of Form F-4 and General Instruction E(c)(2) of Form 20-F.
257 See 17 CFR 210.1-02(d) (Rule 1-02(d) of Regulation S-X).
258 See Instruction 1 to Item 17(b)(7) of Form S-4.

117
expects the financial statements of the business, i.e., target private operating company, in a
transaction involving a shell company to be audited to the same extent as a registrant in an initial
public offering, because at consummation the financial statements of the target private operating
company become that of the registrant.260 The proposed amendments would codify this existing
staff guidance.
3. Age of Financial Statements of the Predecessor
Proposed Rule 15-01(c) would provide that the age of financial statements for a private
operating company that would be the predecessor to a shell company in a registration statement
or proxy statement would be based on whether the private operating company would qualify as
smaller reporting company if filing its own initial registration statement. Absent this
amendment, our rules require filing financial statements of the private operating company that
would be required in an annual report, which do not have the same age requirements as those in
the context of an initial registration statement.261 Similar to the other proposed amendments to
Regulation S-X, this amendment would further align the financial statement requirements for a
private operating company involved in a business combination with a shell company with those
required in a Securities Act registration statement for an initial public offering. If the private
operating company would qualify to be a smaller reporting company, it would apply Rule 8-08
of Regulation S-X for the age of financial statements.262 Otherwise, the private operating
 260 See FRM at Section 4110.5 for a chart that outlines the staff’s application of certain PCAOB requirements in
various filings with the SEC, which includes transactions involving a shell company.
261 For example, in an annual report, a domestic company with net losses in its recently completed fiscal year would
have up to 90 days after its most recently completed fiscal year-end to update its third quarter financial statements.
In contrast, in an initial registration statement, it would have up to only 45 days. See General Instruction A. to Form
10-K and 17 CFR 210.3-12 (Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X).
262 See 17 CFR 210.8-08 (Rule 8-08 of Regulation S-X), which states financial statements may be as current as of
the end of the third fiscal quarter when the anticipated effective or mailing date falls within 45 days after the end of
the fiscal year, OR if the date falls within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year and (1) if a reporting company, all
118
company would apply the age of financial statement requirements in Rules 3-01(c) and 3-12 of
Regulation S-X. Based on the staff’s experience reviewing these transactions, we believe this
proposed amendment to be consistent with existing practice.
We are not proposing amendments to the age requirements for the financial statements of
the shell company registrant because we continue to believe that the age requirements in Articles
3 and 8 of Regulation S-X that apply to existing registrants are appropriate. Thus, the existing
provisions in Articles 3 and 8 of Regulation S-X for reporting companies required to file under
Exchange Act Section 13(a) or 15(d) would continue to apply to shell companies.
263
4. Acquisitions of Businesses by a Shell Company Registrant or Its
Predecessor That Are Not or Will Not Be the Predecessor
The financial statements of a target private operating company that is or will be the
predecessor to a shell company registrant are required in registration statements or proxy
statements related to the business combination.264 The financial statements of any other
businesses, besides the predecessor, that have been, or are probable to be, acquired may also be
required.265 For example, “Shell Company A” and “Target Private Operating Company B” are
part of a business combination and a Form S-4 registration statement is filed. Target Private
Operating Company B acquired “Company C” before the Form S-4 was filed. The proposed
amendments in this section would address the reporting required for Company C in this nonexclusive example.
 reports due were filed; (2) in good faith the company expects to report income in the fiscal year just completed; and
(3) it reported income in at least one of the two previous fiscal years.
263 See Rule 3-01(c) of Regulation S-X (Rule 8-08 for smaller reporting companies), which applies to reporting
companies required to file under Exchange Act Section 13(a) or 15(d).
264 See Item 17 of Form S-4 or Form F-4, § 240.14A-3(b), and Items 13 and 14 of Schedule 14A.
265 See 17 CFR 230.408(a) (Securities Act Rule 408(a)) and 17 CFR 240.12b-20 (Exchange Act Rule 12b-20).
119
Under existing rules,266 financial statements of a business acquired or probable of being
acquired by the target private operating company (e.g., “Company C” in the above example) are
required to be filed in a registration statement or proxy/information statement only when
omission of those financial statements would render the target company’s financial statements
substantially incomplete or misleading. In order to specify when such financial statements are
required, we are proposing new Rule 15-01(d) of Regulation S-X to require application of Rules
3-05 or 8-04 (or Rule 3-14 as it relates to a real estate operation), the Regulation S-X provisions
related to financial statements of an acquired business, to acquisitions of businesses by a shell
company registrant, or its predecessor, that are not or will not be the predecessor to the
registrant.267 This proposal would further align the financial reporting for a shell company
business combination contained in Forms S-4 or F-4 and a proxy or information statement with
what would be required to be included in a Securities Act registration statement for an initial
public offering of the target private operating company. Based on staff’s experience reviewing
these transactions, we understand this proposed amendment to be consistent with the current
market practice of applying Rule 3-05 (or Rule 8-04) to acquisitions by the target private
operating company in the context of a business combination involving a shell company.
In connection with this proposed amendment in Rule 15-01(d), we also considered and
are proposing amendments related to the significance tests in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X
that determine when acquired business financial statements are required. The existing tests as
applied to acquisitions involving shell companies appear inconsistent with the reasons
 266 Id.
267 17 CFR 210.8-04 (Rule 8-04) applies when the registrant or, depending on the context, its predecessor would
qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most recently completed fiscal year
if it were filing a registration statement itself.
120
underlying the sliding scale approach adopted in Rule 3-05.
268 Rule 1-02(w) requires the
financial information of the registrant, which may be a shell company, to be used as the
denominator for the significant subsidiary tests and does not address the scenario when there is
both a shell company registrant and target private operating company that is or will be its
predecessor. Because a shell company has nominal activity, the application of such tests results
in limited to no sliding scale for business acquisitions, including those made by the private
operating company that will be the predecessor to the shell company, because every acquisition
would be significant and thus require financial statements.269 Such application may limit the
ability to recognize which acquisitions have a greater impact on the predecessor than others.270
We are proposing to amend Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X to require that significance
of the acquired business be calculated using the private operating company’s financial
information as the denominator instead of that of the shell company registrant. Using the private
operating company’s financial statements for the denominator should produce results more

Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired or To Be Acquired, Release No. 33-6413 (June 24, 1982) [47 FR
29832 (July 9, 1982)] (“Rule 3-05 Adopting Release”). The requirements are based on the significant subsidiary
tests using a sliding scale so that the requirements for filing such financial statements, as well as the periods covered
by such financial statements, will vary with the percentage impact of the acquisition on the registrant. In adopting
the sliding scale approach, the Commission stated its belief that the selected percentages “meet the objectives of
providing adequate financial information to investors, shareholders and other users while at the same time reducing
the reporting burdens of registrants involved in acquisitions.”
269 For example, financial statements of a business that the private operating company has acquired and represents
less than 5% of its total assets, revenue and net income could be required in the Form S-4 because the acquired
business would be compared to the shell company’s financial statements.
270 The 2020 amendments to Rules 1-02(w) and 3-05 did not affect the financial statements related to the acquisition
of a business that is the subject of a proxy statement or registration statement on Form S-4 or Form F-4. See
Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, Release 33-10786, (May 21, 2020)
[85 FR 54002 (Aug. 31, 2020)], n.20.
121
consistent with the sliding scale approach in Rule 3-05 and recognizes that certain acquisitions
have a greater impact than others.271
Related to the application of the significance tests, we considered the impact of the
application of 17 CFR 210.11-01(b)(3)(i)(B) (“Rule 11-01(b)(3)(i)(B) of Regulation S-X”). This
rule permits, in certain circumstances, the use of pro forma amounts that depict significant
business acquisitions and dispositions consummated after the latest fiscal year-end, for which the
registrant’s financial statements are required to be filed, for the registrant’s financial information
in the significance tests.
272 While we are not proposing amendments to this paragraph in Rule
11-01, based on the proposed amendment to 17 CFR 210.11-01(d) (“Rule 11-01(d)”) described
below, we highlight that application of this rule may change and result in a future acquired
business being compared to the pro forma amounts related to the shell company and target
private operating company business combination transaction in filings made after the
consummation of the business combination transaction.273 The impact of such application would
be that the SPAC’s financial statements, including its cash, would be part of the pro forma
financial information and will likely increase the denominator in the significance tests compared
to measuring an acquisition solely on the target private operating company.
We are proposing new 17 CFR 210.15-01(d)(2) (“Rule 15-01(d)(2)”) to specify when the
financial statements of a recently acquired business (or real estate operation) that is not the
private operating company that will be the predecessor, which are omitted from a shell company
 271 Ibid.
272 Such pro forma use is permitted if the registrant has filed audited financial statements for any such acquired
business for the periods required by Rule 3-05 or Rule 3-14 and the pro forma information required by Rule 11-01
through 11-02 of Regulation S-X.
273 Pursuant to the proposed amendment to Rule 11-01d) that would stipulate that the SPAC is a business, an
acquisition of the SPAC is considered to be an acquisition of a business, and the conditions to use pro forma
financial statements depicting the acquisition as the denominator in the significance tests may be met.
122
registration, proxy, or information statement under Regulation S-X, would be required to be
filed. Rule 3-05(b)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-X provides that financial statements of a probable of
being acquired or recently acquired business may be omitted from a registration, proxy, or
information statement when their significance is measured at 50% or less (or Rule 3-14(b)(3)(ii)
as it relates to a real estate operation). The rule further provides that financial statements of a
recently acquired business, when omitted from the registration statement or proxy or information
statement, must be filed under cover of Form 8-K within 75 days after consummation of the
acquisition. Because the significance of the acquisition is greater than 20% but less than 50%,
the recently acquired business’s financial statements, which are omitted from the registration,
proxy, or information statement, must be filed.274 However, it is unclear how those financial
statements are to be filed when the private operating company is not yet subject to Exchange Act
reporting requirements and thus may not be able to file a Form 8-K. Rather than requiring a
post-effective amendment, we are proposing in Rule 15-01(d)(2) that the financial statements of
the acquired business omitted from the previously-filed registration, proxy, or information
statement would be required in an Item 2.01(f) Form 8-K filed with Form 10 information.
5. Financial Statements of a Shell Company Registrant After the
Combination with Predecessor
In recent years, the staff has received questions on whether the historical financial
statements of the shell company are required in filings made after the business combination. Due
to the lack of clarity regarding the application of the financial statement requirements in Articles
3 and 8 of Regulation S-X, we are proposing new Rule 15-01(e), which would allow a registrant
to exclude the financial statements of a shell company, including a SPAC, for periods prior to the
 274 Rule 3-05 generally requires financial statements of an acquired business when the conditions in Rule 1-02(w)
related to significant subsidiary exceed 20%.
123
acquisition once the following conditions have been met: (1) the financial statements of the shell
company have been filed for all required periods through the acquisition date, and (2) the
financial statements of the registrant include the period in which the acquisition was
consummated.
In the example of a de-SPAC transaction, the financial statements of the SPAC, as a shell
company, would generally no longer be relevant or meaningful to an investor after a de-SPAC
transaction once the financial statements of the registrant include the period in which the deSPAC transaction was consummated for any filing.275 The proposed rule would apply regardless
of whether the de-SPAC transaction is accounted for as a forward acquisition of the target
private operating company by the SPAC or a reverse recapitalization of the target private
operating company. The financial statements of the SPAC would be required in all filings
(including registration statements and the Form 8-K with Form 10 information filed following
the de-SPAC transaction) prior to the filing of the first periodic report that includes those postbusiness combination financial statements. The proposed amendments should not result in a
significant change from current practice as it relates to periodic reports because the staff in the
last several years has not objected to the registrant excluding the historical financial statements
of the SPAC from periodic reports once the financial statements for the registrant include the
period in which the acquisition or recapitalization was consummated.
Further, the proposed amendments would not change the requirement that a registrant
must provide all material information as may be necessary to make required statements, in light
 275 Once the financial statements of the registrant include the period in which the de-SPAC transaction was
consummated, the financial statements required would be those of the predecessor for all historical periods
presented.
124
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,276 so if there is information
included in or about the historical SPAC financial statements that would be material to an
investor, a registrant would still be required to provide such information.
6. Other Amendments
In addition, we are proposing a number of other related amendments as follows:
• We are proposing to amend Rule 11-01(d) of Regulation S-X to state that a SPAC is a
business for purposes of the rule. While Rule 11-01(d) states that an entity is presumed
to be a business, consideration of the continuity of the SPAC’s operations prior to and
after the de-SPAC transaction may lead some parties to conclude that the SPAC is not a
business under the rule. Nonetheless, given the significant equity transactions generally
undertaken by a SPAC, we believe the financial statements of the SPAC could be
material to an investor, particularly when they underpin adjustments to pro forma
financial information in a transaction when an operating company is the legal acquirer of
a SPAC. As a result of the proposed rule, an issuer that is not a SPAC may be required to
file financial statements of the SPAC in a resale registration statement on Form S-1.
• Item 2.01(f) of Form 8-K currently requires a shell company registrant to file, after an
acquisition, the information that would be required if the registrant were filing a general
form for the registration of securities on Form 10. We are proposing to revise this Item to
refer to “acquired business,” rather than “registrant,” in an effort to clarify that the
information provided relates to the acquired business and for periods prior to
consummation of the acquisition and not the shell company registrant.
 276 See Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, Securities Act Rule 408(a).
125
• Rule 3-02 of Regulation S-X requires that statements of comprehensive income be filed
for the registrant and its predecessors. However, as it relates to balance sheets, certain
provisions in Regulation S-X specify that they be filed for the registrant and do not
specifically refer to balance sheets of predecessors. We do not believe the intent of these
rules is to provide the predecessor’s statements of comprehensive income without the
balance sheets as that would not be considered a complete set of financial statements and
would be inconsistent with Article 3 of Regulation S-X that requires both. We are
proposing amendments to Rules 3-01, 8-02, and 10-01(a)(1) of Regulation S-X to
specifically refer to financial statements of predecessors consistent with the provision
regarding income statements. These amendments codify existing financial reporting
practices, and we do not expect them to result in any changes in disclosures.
Request for Comment
103. Should we adopt the amendments and new rules related to aligning financial statement
disclosures, including Rule 15-01 of Regulation S-X, as proposed?
104. Should Rule 15-01 provide that the term audit (or examination), when used in regard to
financial statements of a business that is or will be a predecessor to a shell company,
means an examination of the financial statements by an independent accountant in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB for the purpose of expressing an opinion
thereon, as proposed?
105. Should Article 15 of Regulation S-X address financial statement requirements for the
acquisition by a shell company of a business that will be its predecessor, as proposed, or
should we limit the requirements to apply only to a de-SPAC transaction, and if so, why?
126
106. Should the significance tests that determine whether the financial statements of
businesses that are not or will not be the predecessor are required to be filed employ the
denominator of the private operating company in lieu of that of the shell company
registrant, as proposed? Should the pro forma financial information that gives effect to
the shell company transaction be allowed to be used as the denominator in measuring the
significance of other acquisitions not involving a predecessor? Should there be
restrictions on when such pro forma financial information is used to measure
significance, such as only for acquisitions that occur subsequent to consummation of the
transaction and not for acquisitions that are done in tandem with the shell company
transaction?
107. Should the financial statements of a shell company not be required in filings once the
financial statements of the registrant include the period in which the acquisition was
consummated, as proposed? Are there situations in which investors would continue to
rely upon the information in the shell company financial statements after the acquisition
was consummated and reflected in the financial statements of the registrant, or other
factors we should consider in determining when the shell company financial statements
should not be required in filings after the acquisition is complete? Should the accounting
for the transaction as a forward acquisition or reverse recapitalization determine whether
the financial statements are required in filings made after the acquisition was
consummated?
108. Should Rule 11-01(d) of Regulation S-X be amended to state that a SPAC is a business
for purposes of the rule, as proposed? Would it change the existing application of Rule
11-01(b)(3)(i)(B) of Regulation S-X as it relates to de-SPAC transactions? Should
127
eliciting the financial statements of the SPAC in a resale registration statement of an
issuer that is not a SPAC be accomplished through a rule that specifically requires the
SPAC financial statements to be filed (subject to the provisions of proposed Rule 15-
01(e))?
109. The Form 8-K filed pursuant to Item 2.01(f) may require a third fiscal year of certain
financial statements for an acquired business that is the predecessor to a shell company
and an emerging growth company, while Rule 15-01(b), as proposed, would only require
two. Should we amend the Form 8-K requirement to provide an exception to the required
Form 10-type information so the financial statements of the acquired business need not
be presented for any period prior to the earliest audited period previously presented in
connection with a registration, proxy, or information statement of the registrant?
V. ENHANCED PROJECTIONS DISCLOSURE
A. Background
Disclosure of financial projections is not expressly required by the federal securities laws;
however, there are various reasons why registrants produce and disclose such information. For
example, projections may be disclosed to comply with state or foreign corporate law regarding
the board’s decision to approve a business combination transaction or the basis underlying a
fairness opinion issued by a financial advisor.
277 Companies engaged in business combination
transactions may use projections to negotiate the offered consideration, terms, and conditions and
to allocate risks in those transactions. Companies may also disclose projections to avoid claims

277 See, e.g., In re Netsmart Techs., Inc., 924 A.2d 171 (Del. Ch. 2007), and the disclosure of the substantive work
performed by the financial advisor, see, e.g., In re Pure Res., Inc., 808 A.2d 421 (Del. Ch. 2002).
128
that the omission of such information violates federal anti-fraud provisions or to satisfy certain
requirements under Regulation M-A.278
Recent events have raised renewed concerns about the use of projections, particularly
with respect to de-SPAC transactions in which private operating companies disclose projections
that may lack a reasonable basis.279 For example, some companies have presented projections of
significant increases in revenue or market share even though they do not have any operations at
the time such projections were prepared.280 Other companies have allegedly used materially
misleading assumptions, failed to take into account foreseeable future events in developing

278 See Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13e-3(b)(1)(ii), and 17 CFR 240.14a-9 (Exchange Act Rule 14a-9),
Securities Act Rule 408(a), and Exchange Act Section 14(e). See also Item 1004(b)(2)(iii) and 1011(c) of
Regulation M-A. Omission of projections used by the board or the fairness opinion advisers, in particular, have
been the subject of various lawsuits filed in federal courts alleging violation of Rule 14a-9. See, e.g., Smith v.
Robbins & Myers, Inc., 969 F.Supp.2d 850 (2013), Azar v. Blount Intern., Inc., No. 3:16-cv-483-SI, 2017 WL
1055966, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39493 (D. Or. Mar. 20, 2017), and NECA-IBEW Pension Trust Fund v. Precision
Castparts Corp., No. 3:16-cv-01756-YY, 2017 WL 4453561, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165139 (D. Or. Oct. 3, 2017),
adopted by 2018 WL 533912, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11463 (D. Or. Jan. 24, 2018) (relating to disclosed projections
that management knew were not reflective of management’s plans for the registrant).
279 The Commission recently has brought enforcement actions alleging the use of baseless or unsupported
projections about future revenues and the use of materially misleading underlying financial projections. These cases
involve both SPACs and other reporting companies. See the following matters related to SPACs: In the Matter of
Momentus, Inc., et. al., Exch. Act Rel. No. 34-92391 (July 13, 2021); SEC vs. Hurgin, et al., Case No. 1:19-cv05705 (S.D.N.Y., filed June 18, 2019); In the Matter of Benjamin H. Gordon, Exch. Act Rel. No. 34-86164 (June
20, 2019); and, SEC vs. Milton, Case No. 1:21-cv-6445 (S.D.N.Y., filed July 29, 2021). See the following nonSPAC cases: SEC vs. CanaFarma Hemp Products Corp, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08211 (S.D.N.Y., filed Oct. 5,
2021); SEC v. Thomas, et al., Civil Action No. 19-cv-1132 (D. Nev., filed June 28, 2019); In the Matter of Ribbon
Communications Inc., et. al., Exch. Act Rel. No. 34-83791 (Aug. 7, 2018); SEC v. Enviro Board Corporation, et al.,
[Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-06427 (C.D. Cal., filed Aug. 26, 2016)]; and SEC v. Roberts, et. al., Civil Action No.
8:15-cv-2093-T-17-MAP (M.D. Fla., filed Sept. 9, 2015). See also Dave Michaels, Regulators Hit Space SPAC
Over Disclosures, The Wall Street Journal, July 26, 2021.
280 Some news reports have also suggested that many post-business combination companies, particularly those with
less revenue or that are early stage companies, do not meet revenue or earnings targets that they provided to
investors at the time of the de-SPAC transaction. An analysis performed by The Wall Street Journal indicates that,
of the 63 companies that became public companies through a de-SPAC transaction in 2021 and had less than $10
million in sales at the time of the transaction, at least 30 did not meet their projections. The article reported that the
companies in the analysis expected to miss their 2021 revenue projections fell short by an average of 53% and that
companies falling short of their earnings projections have estimated losses that are approximately 40% greater, on
average, than they projected at the time of the de-SPAC transaction. See Heather Somerville, SPACs Fall Short of
Lofty Goals, The Wall Street Journal, Feb. 26, 2022.
129
projections, or used projections unsupported by a target’s experience.281 Similar potentially
misleading projections have been used in non-SPAC filings, including with respect to future
revenues, prospects and profitability.282 Although the Commission has previously acknowledged
that projections and other forward-looking information can provide useful information for
investors when making voting and investment decisions,283 it has also recognized that the use of
such forward-looking information could raise investor protection concerns.284 Accordingly, the
Commission adopted Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K to set forth its views on important factors to
be considered in formulating and disclosing such projections in certain Commission filings.285
Item 10(b) states that management has the option to present in Commission filings its good faith
assessment of a registrant’s future performance, but it also states that management must have a
reasonable basis for such an assessment. Item 10(b) further expresses the Commission’s views
on the need for disclosure of the assumptions underlying the projections, the limitations of such
projections, and the format of the projections.
B. Rule Proposals
We are proposing to amend Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K to expand and update the
Commission’s views on the use of projections. Among other things, the proposed amendments
would address the presentation of projections by companies with no history of operations and

In connection with the adoption of the integrated reporting system, the Commission rescinded several staff guides
relating to the preparation of registration statements and reports and relocated the substance of some of them into
Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K. See Rescission of Guides and Redesignation of Industry Guides, Release No. 33-
6384 (Mar. 16, 1982) [47 FR 11476 (Mar. 16, 1982)].
130
provide that the guidance in the item also applies to projections of future economic performance
of persons other than the registrant, such as the target company in a business combination.
Further, given the widespread use of projections in de-SPAC transactions and the resulting
heightened concerns, we are also proposing new Item 1609 of Regulation S-K that would be
applicable to financial projections used in de-SPAC transactions and would set forth additional
disclosure requirements relating to financial projections.
The proposed revisions to Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K and proposed Item 1609 of
Regulation S-K are intended to help address concerns about the use of projections in de-SPAC
transactions and similar circumstances. By providing additional guidance for registrants and
mandating specific disclosures in de-SPAC transactions, these proposed rules could enhance the
attention and level of care companies bring to the preparation of financial projections, both in deSPAC transaction filings and in other filings made with the Commission.
1. Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K
We are proposing to amend Item 10(b) to present the Commission’s updated views on
projected financial information. The proposed amendments to Item 10(b) would continue to
state the Commission’s view that projected financial information included in filings subject to
Item 10(b) must have a reasonable basis. To address specific concerns that some companies may
present projections more prominently than actual historical results (or the fact that they have no
operations at all) or use non-GAAP financial measures in the projections without a clear
explanation or definition of such a measure, we propose to amend Item 10(b) to state that:
• Any projected measures that are not based on historical financial results or operational
history should be clearly distinguished from projected measures that are based on
historical financial results or operational history;
131
• It generally would be misleading to present projections that are based on historical
financial results or operational history without presenting such historical measure or
operational history with equal or greater prominence; and
• The presentation of projections that include a non-GAAP financial measure should
include a clear definition or explanation of the measure, a description of the GAAP
financial measure to which it is most closely related,286 and an explanation why the nonGAAP financial measure was used instead of a GAAP measure.287
These proposed changes, if adopted, should assist registrants in presenting their
projections in an appropriate format and with the appropriate context, which in turn should
facilitate investors’ evaluation of the projections, assessment of the reasonableness of the bases
for these projections (particularly when compared to historical performance and results), and
determinations about the appropriate reliance to place on the projections when making an
investment or voting decision.
Finally, Item 10(b) currently refers to projections regarding the future performance of a
“registrant.” In business combination transactions, it is common for projections of the target
company to be included in the Securities Act registration statement or proxy statement filed by
the acquiring company. In such a case, it may be unclear if the guidance in Item 10(b) applies to
the target company’s projections because the target company is not the registrant for that filing.
In our view, Item 10(b) should apply to such projections because they are nevertheless being
presented to investors through the registration statement or proxy statement filed by the

286 The reference to the nearest GAAP measure called for by amended Item 10(b) would not require a reconciliation
to that GAAP measure. The need to provide a GAAP reconciliation would continue to be governed by Regulation G
and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.
287 The Commission stated a similar view in 2003. See Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,
Release No. 33-8176 (Jan. 22, 2003), section II.B.2 [68 FR 4820 (Jan. 30, 2003)].
132
acquiring company. Accordingly, we are proposing to amend Item 10(b) to state that the
guidance therein applies to any projections of future economic performance of persons other than
the registrant, such as the target company in a business combination transaction, that are included
in the registrant’s Commission filings.
Request for Comment
110. Should we amend Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K, as proposed? Is there additional or
different guidance we should provide?
111. Instead of applying to all filings covered by Item 10(b), as proposed, should the proposed
updated guidance apply solely to filings relating to business combination transactions
(including de-SPAC transactions), while retaining the existing Item 10(b) guidance for
other filings?
112. Are the proposed amendments to Item 10(b) necessary in light of proposed Item 1609 of
Regulation S-K, which is limited to de-SPAC transactions?
113. Are there different ways of presenting financial projections that would be beneficial to
investors? For example, should we require registrants to present some or all financial
projections in a separately captioned section of a Commission filing?
2. Item 1609 of Regulation S-K
We are also proposing new Item 1609 of Regulation S-K that would apply only to deSPAC transactions.288 The nature of the SPAC structure and de-SPAC transactions raise
heightened concerns about the use of projections in such transactions. As noted above, a
sponsor’s compensation may depend to a large extent on the completion of the de-SPAC

288 The disclosure would be required in the forms or schedules filed for de-SPAC transactions.
133
transaction, and thus the SPAC and its sponsor may have an incentive to use a private operating
company’s financial projections in seeking support for the de-SPAC transaction.289 In particular,
such projections could be used to value the private operating company and may influence how
investors evaluate a proposed de-SPAC transaction.290 Similarly, as a consequence of the
SPAC’s expected valuation of the private operating company on the basis of this type of
financial projections, controlling shareholders and management of the private operating company
may have an incentive to be overly aggressive in their development of projections as a means of
justifying a higher price for their company.291 Aggressive projections may also be used by the
SPAC or the private operating company to justify the target’s valuation in order to help meet any
exchange listing requirement that the target has a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the
balance of funds in the SPAC’s trust account.292
For these reasons, we are proposing additional disclosures intended to assist investors in
assessing the bases of projections used in de-SPAC transactions and determining to what extent
they should rely on such projections. Proposed Item 1609 would require a registrant to provide
the following disclosures:
• With respect to any projections disclosed by the registrant, the purpose for which the
projections were prepared and the party that prepared the projections;

289 There is evidence that, in a majority of de-SPAC transactions announced in the twelve months ending in the first
quarter of 2021, the private operating companies were pre-revenue, thus making financial projections an important
basis for SPACs and private operating companies to find additional investments and to receive support for de-SPAC
transactions. See “Why Have SPAC Valuations Skyrocketed?,” Stuart Gleichenhaus and Bill Stotzer, FTI
Consulting, Aug. 6, 2021.
290 In this regard, we note that there also is evidence of the different uses of, and greater reliance on, financial
projections by retail investors than by institutional investors. See Dambra, Even-Tov, and George, supra note 33.
291 See Kimball Chapman, Richard M. Frankel, and Xiumin Martin, SPACs and Forward-Looking Disclosure: Hype
or Information? (SSRN Working Paper, 2021).
292 See, e.g., NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 102.06 and Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.
134
• All material bases of the disclosed projections and all material assumptions
underlying the projections, and any factors that may materially impact such
assumptions (including a discussion of any factors that may cause the assumptions to
be no longer reasonable, material growth rates or discount multiples used in preparing
the projections, and the reasons for selecting such growth rates or discount multiples);
and
• Whether the disclosed projections still reflect view of the board or management of the
SPAC or target company, as applicable, as of the date of the filing; if not, then
discussion of the purpose of disclosing the projections and the reasons for any
continued reliance by the management or board on the projections.
These proposed disclosures would inform investors about why the projections were prepared,
and by whom, which could allow them to better understand the motivations underlying such
projections. In addition, the proposed disclosures could help investors assess the continued
reliability of the projections both independently and through the views of the board or
management.
Request for Comment
114. Should we adopt Item 1609 as proposed? Are there additional disclosures that we should
require in de-SPAC transaction filings related to financial projections?
115. As proposed, Item 1609 of Regulation S-K would apply only to de-SPAC transactions.
Should we expand the scope of the item to apply to all companies that publicly disclose
financial projections in Commission filings?
116. Should we prohibit the disclosure of any specific financial measures or metrics? If so,
which measures or metrics?
135
117. Will proposed Item 1609 discourage the use of financial projections in de-SPAC
transactions? What impact would this have on investors? Would our proposal have any
impact on the ability to comply with state or foreign law obligations regarding
disclosures of projections used in business combination transactions?
118. Both the proposed amendments relating to the PSLRA safe harbor and proposed Item
1609 may result in market participants using financial projections in de-SPAC
transactions in a different manner than they do currently. Would adoption of only one of
the proposals strike a better balance in terms of the costs and benefits with respect to the
use of projections? If so, which proposal?
VI. PROPOSED SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
A. Background
While the number of SPACs has grown dramatically in recent years,293 some SPACs
have sought to operate in novel ways that suggest that SPACs and their sponsors should increase
their focus on evaluating when a SPAC could be an investment company.294 We are concerned
that SPACs may fail to recognize when their activities raise the investor protection concerns
addressed by the Investment Company Act.
295 To assist SPACs in focusing on, and appreciating

293 See supra notes 7-8 and accompanying text.
294 The growth of the SPAC industry, among other things, has also sparked debate about the status of SPACs as
investment companies. See, e.g., Kristi Marvin, 49 Law Firms Unite and Push Back on Recent SPAC Litigation,
SPAC Insider (Aug. 27, 2021), available at https://spacinsider.com/2021/08/27/49-law-firms-unite-push-back-onspac-litigation/; Alison Frankel, Law Profs Defend Theory that SPAC is Illegal under the Investment Company Act,
Reuters (Nov. 1, 2021).
295 The Investment Company Act regulates the organization of investment companies that engage primarily in
investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities, and whose own securities are offered to the investing public. The
Act is designed to minimize conflicts of interest that arise in these complex operations protecting investors by
preventing insiders from managing the companies to their benefit and to the detriment of public investors;
preventing the issuance of securities having inequitable or discriminatory provisions; preventing the management of
investment companies by irresponsible persons; preventing the use of unsound or misleading methods of computing
earnings and asset value; preventing changes in the character of investment companies without the consent of
investors; preventing investment companies from engaging in excessive leveraging; and ensuring the disclosure of
136
when, they may be subject to investment company regulation, we are proposing Rule 3a-10,
which would provide a safe harbor from the definition of “investment company” under Section
3(a)(1)(A)296 of the Investment Company Act for SPACs that meet the conditions discussed
below.297 We believe that certain SPAC structures and practices may raise serious questions as
to their status as investment companies. While a SPAC would not be required to rely on the safe
harbor, we have designed the proposed conditions of the safe harbor to align with the structures
and practices that we preliminarily believe would distinguish a SPAC that is likely to raise these
questions from one that would not.
1. Potential Status as an Investment Company
Section 3(a)(1)(A) defines an “investment company” as any issuer that is or holds itself
out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing,
reinvesting, or trading in securities. Depending on the facts and circumstances, SPACs could
meet the definition of “investment company” in Section 3(a)(1)(A). To assess a SPAC’s status
as an investment company under that definition, we generally look to the SPAC’s assets, the
sources of its income, its historical development, its public representations of policy, and the
activities of its officers and directors (known as the “Tonopah factors”).298

full and accurate information about the companies and their sponsors. See Section 1(b) of the Investment Company
Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-1(b)].
296 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(1)(A).
297 Proposed 17 CFR 270.3a-10. SPACs that meet the proposed rule’s conditions would not need to register under
the Investment Company Act.
298 See In the Matter of Tonopah Mining Co., 26 S.E.C. 426 (July 21, 1947). See generally SEC v. National Presto
Industries, Inc., 486 F.3d 305 (7th Cir. May 15, 2007), rev’g. SEC v. National Presto Industries Inc., Case No. 02 C
5057 (N.D. Ill, Oct. 31, 2005). The Tonopah factors were first used by the Commission to determine an issuer’s
primary engagement under Section 3(b)(2), but have been applied in part or in totality to determine an issuer’s
primary engagement in other contexts under the Investment Company Act, including Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
Certain Prima Facie Investment Companies, Release No. IC-10937 (Nov. 13, 1979) [44 FR 66608 (Nov. 20, 1979)]
at n.24 (“Proposing Release to Rule 3a-1”) (“Although [Tonopah] was decided under [S]ection 3(b)(2) of the Act,
the “primary engagement” standard set forth in that case also appears to be applicable to the identical standard of
Section 3(a)(1)[A] and [S]ection 3(b)(1).”). The Commission has also considered the activities of the company’s
137
SPACs are generally formed to identify, acquire and operate a target company through a
business combination and not with a stated purpose of being an investment company.299 We
understand that SPACs typically view their public representations, historical development and
efforts of officers and directors as consistent with those of issuers that are not investment
companies. At the same time, most SPACs ordinarily invest substantially all their assets in
securities, often for a period of a year or more, meaning that investors hold interests for an
extended period in a pool of securities. Moreover, whatever income a SPAC generates during
this period is generally attributable to its securities holdings. The asset composition and sources
of income for most SPACs may therefore raise questions about their status as investment
companies under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act and, in assessing this status,
these factors would need to be weighed together with the other Tonopah factors.
2. Rationale for the Safe Harbor
The safe harbor we are proposing focuses on conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration,
asset composition, business purpose and activities as a means of enhancing investor
protection.300 The proposed rule is designed so that, if a SPAC satisfies the rule’s conditions,

employees, in addition to company’s officers and directors, in determining a company’s primary business. See, e.g.,
17 CFR 270.3a-8 (Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company Act); Snowflake Inc., Release No. IC-34049 (Oct. 9,
2020) [85 FR 65449 (Oct. 15, 2020)] (notice), Release No. IC-34085 (Nov. 4, 2020) (order); Lyft Inc., Release No.
IC-33399 (Mar. 14, 2019) [84 FR 10156 (Mar. 19, 2019)] (notice), Release No. IC-33442 (Apr. 8, 2019) (order).
299 See generally supra Section I.
300 We understand that SPACs typically place most of their assets in a trust or escrow accounts. Although the
Commission has never addressed the status of SPACs under the Investment Company Act, the Commission has
addressed the status of escrow or trust accounts established by blank check companies that comply with Rule 419
under the Securities Act (“Rule 419 Accounts”). The Commission took the position that “although a Rule 419
Account may be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, in light of the purposes served
by the regulatory requirement to establish such an account, the limited nature of the investments, and the limited
duration of the account, such an account will neither be required to register as an investment company nor regulated
as an investment company as long as it meets the requirements of Rule 419.” Blank Check Offerings, supra note 6
(“Rule 419 Adopting Release”), at text accompanying n.32. SPACs have evolved since the Commission adopted
Rule 419, and as noted above, SPACs are not subject to the requirements of Rule 419. See supra notes 12 and 13
and accompanying text.
138
together with the disclosure requirements being proposed in this release, such SPAC’s operations
would be limited and differ sufficiently from those of investment companies so as to generally
not raise the types of investor protection concerns that the Investment Company Act is intended
to address. In addition, the proposed rule may also promote investor protection by highlighting
for SPACs and their sponsors the Investment Company Act concerns that certain SPAC activities
may raise.
The proposed rule may also have the effect of providing more certainty to SPACs
regarding their status under the Investment Company Act. This in turn, could facilitate capital
formation because SPACs that operate within the boundaries of the safe harbor would be assured
that they would not qualify as investment companies. The rule may also promote efficiency by
providing a clear framework for SPACs to determine their status under the Investment Company
Act.301
3. Boundaries of the Safe Harbor
While a SPAC would not be required to rely on the safe harbor, we have designed the
proposed conditions of the safe harbor to align with the structures and practices that we
preliminarily believe would distinguish a SPAC that is likely to raise serious questions as to its
status as an investment company under the Investment Company Act from one that would not.
Activities that would raise these concerns include, solely by way of example and without
limitation, if a SPAC were to invest in securities not permitted by the proposed safe harbor,
actively manage its portfolio, or hold itself out in a manner that suggests investors should invest
to gain exposure to the portfolio it holds prior to the de-SPAC transaction.

301 For these reasons, we believe the safe harbor, subject to the proposed conditions, would be necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by
the policy and provisions of the Act. See Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C.80a-6(c)]. See
also Section 38(a) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C.80a-37(a)].
139
A SPAC would raise similar concerns if it were to invest its assets in securities, including
those permitted by the safe harbor, for a lengthier period of time without identifying a target
company. As discussed below, we are concerned that, the longer the SPAC operates with its
assets invested in securities and its income derived from securities, the more likely investors will
come to view the SPAC as a fund-like investment and the more likely the SPAC will appear to
be deviating from its stated business purpose.302 Similarly, if a SPAC did not seek to engage in a
business combination but instead sought to acquire a minority interest in a target company with
the intention of being a passive investor, it is more likely that it will appear to be an investment
company. Investors in SPACs that engage in the activities discussed above may be at a
significantly greater risk of acquiring SPAC shares expecting a fund-like investment.303
The safe harbor we are proposing only addresses investment company status under
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, commonly known as the “subjective test.”
Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act provides an alternate “objective test” that
defines an “investment company” as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the
business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and that owns or
proposes to acquire investment securities,304 having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the
company’s total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated
basis. If a SPAC owns or proposes to acquire 40% or more of investment securities, it would

302 See infra Section VI.B.2.b.
303 In considering the investment company status of SPACs that do not comply with the safe harbor, we would use
the traditional framework for evaluating the status of a potential investment company discussed above.
304 Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act generally defines “investment securities” to include all securities
except Government securities, securities issued by employees’ securities companies, and securities issued by
majority-owned subsidiaries of the owner which are not investment companies or certain private investment
companies. 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(2).
140
likely need to register and be regulated as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act.
The safe harbor we are proposing is intended to address the status of a qualifying SPAC
from the time of the SPAC’s initial public offering until it completes its de-SPAC transaction.
305
For purposes of the proposed rule, the definitions of SPAC, de-SPAC transaction, and target
company would be the same as those set forth in proposed Item 1601 of Regulation S-K.306
Request for Comment
119. Instead of a safe harbor, should we provide an interpretation concerning when SPACs
would meet the definition of “investment company”? Alternatively, should we exempt
SPACs that meet the definition of “investment company” from any provisions of the
Investment Company Act, and if so, which provisions? Are there any changes we should
make to the proposed approach that would better achieve the objectives of the proposed
rule? Are there conditions we should include in addition to those set forth below?
120. We request comment on whether the safe harbor should include an exemption from
Section 3(a)(1)(C), in addition to Section 3(a)(1)(A). If such an expansion is needed,
please explain the circumstances in which a SPAC could meet the definition of
“investment company” in Section 3(a)(1)(C) while still complying with the conditions in
the proposed safe harbor.
121. Should the proposed rule incorporate the definitions of de-SPAC transaction, special
purpose acquisition company and target company as proposed in Item 1601? Should any

305 The remaining company (or companies) after the de-SPAC transaction may also raise separate questions of
Investment Company Act status. If a remaining company meets the definition of “investment company” following
the de-SPAC transaction, that company would need to register as an investment company or rely on an appropriate
exclusion or exemption under the Investment Company Act.
306 See supra Section II.A.
141
of these definitions be different under proposed Rule 3a-10? If so, please identify the
definition, how the definition should be changed, and why.
122. We understand that SPACs typically place most of their assets in a trust or escrow
account as required by the listing standards. In the event that these accounts may also be
“issuers” under the Investment Company Act,307 does the safe harbor need to address
these accounts under that Act? Alternatively, should the rule text specify that assets and
activities of the SPAC (as discussed below) include those of the trust?
123. As proposed, an existing SPAC that has not completed a de-SPAC transaction prior to the
effective date of the rule would not be prohibited from relying on the safe harbor if it
satisfies the conditions. Should we permit an existing SPAC to rely on the safe harbor if
it does not have a board resolution but has other contemporary evidence of its intent and
otherwise meets the conditions of the safe harbor? Alternatively, should we limit reliance
on the safe harbor to SPACs formed after the effective date of the rule? If proposed Rule
3a-10 is adopted, should the rule’s effective date reflect the possibility that some SPAC’s
may need to alter their operations or more quickly complete a de-SPAC transaction in
order to meet the conditions of the rule? If so, should we provide an extended or delayed
effective date? Should we provide a compliance or transition period, and if so, why?
B. Conditions
The conditions to the safe harbor focus on certain defining characteristics of SPACs308
and are designed to ensure that SPACs wishing to rely on the safe harbor do not operate, or hold
themselves out, as investment companies.

307 See supra note 300.
308 The conditions are also consistent with our approach with respect to Rule 419 Accounts. Id.
142
The conditions are discussed in more detail below.
1. Nature and Management of SPAC Assets
In order to rely on the proposed safe harbor, a SPAC’s assets309 must consist solely of
Government securities,310 Government money market funds311 and cash items312 prior to the
completion of the de-SPAC transaction.313 Thus, all proceeds obtained by the SPAC, including
those from any SPAC offering, cash infusion from the sponsor, or any interest, dividend,
distribution or other such return derived from the SPAC’s underlying assets would need to be
held in these assets. We understand that SPACs typically acquire these assets in part because
they may be easily liquidated to fund any acquisition or other expenses related to the de-SPAC
transaction and investor redemptions and, unlike the investments of registered investment
companies, are not primarily made to achieve an investment purpose.314 This condition reflects
the SPAC’s intended business purpose to acquire assets to fund a de-SPAC transaction and also
generally limits the SPAC’s assets to those that may be consistent with cash management
practices rather than primarily investment purposes.315

309 For purposes of the rule, any references to the SPAC’s assets refer to both the assets held in the trust or escrow
account and any assets held by the SPAC directly.
310 The term “Government security” has the same meaning as defined in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act. 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(16).
311 The term “Government money market fund” has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (a)(14) of Rule 2a-7
under the Investment Company Act. 17 CFR 270.2a-7.
312 The Commission has previously included the following as cash items for purposes of Rule 3a-1: cash, coins,
paper currency, demand deposits with banks, timely checks of others, cashier checks, certified checks, bank drafts,
money orders, travelers’ checks, and letters of credit. See Proposing Release to Rule 3a-1, supra note 298, at text
accompanying n.11. We take the same view here with respect to the proposed rule.
313 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(1).
314 If a SPAC were to significantly change its asset composition contrary to its original representations, it would
raise questions whether the initial representations were false and misleading.
315 This limited asset composition would not, on its own, distinguish a SPAC from an investment company. This
provision is designed to operate together with the other conditions to the safe harbor, and nothing in this provision is
meant to address the status under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of a company that is not relying on this safe harbor, including
those primarily engaged in the business of investing in government securities and/or government money market
143
Under the proposed rule, a SPAC seeking to rely on the safe harbor may not acquire any
other type of asset, including interests in an operating company, prior to the completion of a deSPAC transaction. Acquiring other types of assets and then transferring such assets to another
entity or to SPAC shareholders would suggest that the SPAC’s primary business is that of
investing in securities. Nothing in this provision, however, is intended to preclude the SPAC
from using SPAC assets to pay expenses related to the operation of the SPAC.
Under the proposed rule, the assets set forth in paragraph (a)(1) may not at any time be
acquired or disposed of for the primary purpose of recognizing gains or decreasing losses
resulting from market value changes.
316 Unlike management investment companies, SPACs
typically do not actively manage their portfolios, often holding their Government securities to
maturity. The proposed provision is therefore intended to allow SPACs the flexibility to hold
their assets consistent with cash management practices yet ensure that SPACs relying on the safe
harbor do not engage in activities that would necessitate the investor protections of the
Investment Company Act, like portfolio management practices resembling those that
management investment companies employ.
Request for Comment
124. Should we allow SPACs seeking to rely on the safe harbor to invest in Government
securities? Alternatively, should we limit these SPACs to only certain types of
Government securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities?

funds. For example, an issuer that holds these types of assets, but whose primary business is to achieve investment
returns on such assets would still be an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A).
316 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(2). This provision is similar to that found in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) in 17 CFR 270.3a-7
(Rule 3a-7), and we propose to apply this provision in the same manner in the proposed rule.
144
125. Should we allow SPACs to invest in government money market funds, as defined in Rule
2a-7? Should we instead limit the type of money market funds that a SPAC may invest
in to money market funds that only hold U.S. Treasury securities? Conversely, should
the provision be expanded to permit SPACs to invest in all types of money market funds
provided that they rely on Rule 2a-7?317
126. In addition to the questions raised above, as a general matter, is paragraph (a)(1) too
narrow? For example, should the safe harbor be expanded to include SPACs that acquire
investment securities or other assets (e.g., assets that are not for investment purposes
relevant to the operation of the SPAC)? If yes, please explain which investment
securities and/or assets and why such an expansion of the safe harbor would be
appropriate.
127. Does paragraph (a)(2) provide enough flexibility with respect to a SPAC’s holdings but
yet prevent SPACs from engaging in activities similar to management investment
companies?
128. As noted, we understand that SPACs typically place most of their assets in trust or
escrow accounts. Should the rule text address the manner in which a SPAC holds its
assets? For example, should the rule require SPAC assets to be held in trust or escrow
accounts? If yes, should the safe harbor be conditioned on complying with the terms of
the custody rules under the Investment Company Act as if they applied to these accounts?
2. SPAC Activities
a. De-SPAC Transactions

317 The Commission has taken the position that money market funds relying on Rule 2a-7 may be treated as cash
equivalents for purposes of Rule 2a-7 for GAAP purposes. See Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form
PF, Release No. IC-31166 (July 23, 2014) [79 FR 47736 (Aug. 14, 2014)].
145
The proposed rule would provide a safe harbor only to those SPACs that seek to
complete a single de-SPAC transaction as a result of which the surviving public entity (the
“surviving company”),
318 either directly or through a primarily controlled company,319 will be
primarily engaged in the business of the target company or companies, which is not that of an
investment company. Thus, to rely on the rule, the SPAC must have a business purpose aimed at
providing its shareholders with the opportunity to own interests in a public entity that, in contrast
to an investment company, will either be an operating company, or will, through a primarily
controlled company, operate such operating company.320 In addition, the SPAC would need to
seek to complete a de-SPAC transaction as a result of which the surviving company would have
at least one class of securities listed for trading on a national securities exchange.321
A SPAC would be able to engage in only one de-SPAC transaction while relying on the
safe harbor, but such transaction may involve the combination of multiple target companies,322
provided that the SPAC treats them for all purposes as part of a single de-SPAC transaction.
 318 The proposed rule defines the term “surviving company” to mean the public company issuer that survives a deSPAC transaction and in which the shareholders of the SPAC immediately prior to the de-SPAC transaction will
own equity interests immediately following the de-SPAC transaction. Proposed Rule 3a-10(b)(3).
319 The proposed rule defines the term “primarily controlled company" to mean an issuer that (i) is controlled within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act by the surviving company following a de-SPAC
transaction with a degree of control that is greater than that of any other person and (ii) is not an investment
company. Proposed Rule 3a-10(b)(2).
320 As drafted, the proposed rule would permit a SPAC relying on the safe harbor to seek to engage in a de-SPAC
transaction with any company other than an investment company. Thus a SPAC may seek to engage in a de-SPAC
transaction with a target company that is not considered an investment company under Section 3(a) or that is
excepted or exempted from the definition of investment company by order under Section 3(b) [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(b)]
or by rules or regulations under Section 3(a).
321 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(3)(i). The post-business combination surviving company would have to qualify for
listing on a national securities exchange by meeting initial listing standards just as any company seeking an
exchange listing would have to do. If the surviving company did not qualify for listing, it could not be listed for
trading on a national securities exchange and delisting procedures would commence.
322 The proposed definitions of “special purpose acquisition company” and “de-SPAC transaction” anticipate that a
SPAC may engage in a de-SPAC transaction with more than one target company contemporaneously. See supra
Section II.A.
146
Such intentions would be evidenced by the description in any disclosure or reporting documents,
and that the closing with respect to all target companies occurs contemporaneously and within
the required time frames.323 We are imposing this limitation because we are concerned that a
SPAC that makes multiple acquisitions could be engaging in the types of activities that raise the
investor protection concerns addressed by the Investment Company Act. A SPAC that purchases
multiple companies as part of a single transaction (and complies with the other conditions of the
safe harbor) would not raise these concerns as it would still appear to be seeking to be primarily
engaged in the business of an operating company or companies after the de-SPAC transaction,
and not to be engaged in investment management activities.
While recognizing that de-SPAC transactions may have various structures and may
involve intermediary entities, the proposed safe harbor is intended to ensure that the SPAC must
be seeking a business combination in which the surviving entity, directly or through a primarily
controlled company,324 is primarily engaged in the business of the target company or companies
and not merely seeking an investment opportunity. “Primary control” within the definition of
“primarily controlled company” means that the surviving company must have “control”325 of
such company and the degree of that control must be greater than that of any other person.
326
The “primarily control” standard, which is similar to that found in other status rules under the
Investment Company Act,327 is designed to distinguish a holding company structure for an
 323 See infra Section VI.B.3.
324 See supra note 319.
325 See Section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act for the definition of “control”[15 U.S.C. 80a-2(9)].
326 See, e.g., paragraph (b)(2) of 17 CFR 270.3a-8 (Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company Act.
327 See, e.g., Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company Act; 17 CFR 270.3a-1 (Rule 3a-1 under the Investment
Company Act).
147
operating company from an investment in securities of an operating company.328 As we
previously expressed in a similar context, this level of control is more consistent with an active
role in managing the affairs of a company than if the issuer owns a lesser controlling interest in
such company.329 We believe that a lesser degree of control, or lack of control, would in these
circumstances more closely resemble the activities of an investment company330
In order to rely on the safe harbor, the surviving company must also have at least one
class of securities listed for trading on a national securities exchange.331 This condition
recognizes that a SPAC’s business plan is to engage in a de-SPAC transaction, the result of
which is that SPAC shareholders receive the publicly traded shares of the surviving company.332
Similar to the other parts of this condition, this provision helps to ensure that the SPAC has a
business purpose that is different from engaging primarily in the business of investing,
reinvesting or trading in securities.
b. Evidence of Primary Engagement
The proposed rule would require a SPAC wishing to rely on the safe harbor to be
primarily engaged in the business of seeking to complete a de-SPAC transaction in the manner
and within the time frame set forth in the rule. Such engagement must be evidenced by the

328 See, e.g., Certain Research and Development Companies, Release No. IC-25835 (Nov. 26, 2002) [67 FR 71915
(Dec. 3, 2002)] (“Proposing Release to Rule 3a-8”) at nn.57-58 and accompanying text.
329 See Proposing Release to Rule 3a-1, supra note 287, at n.32. See also Proposing Release to Rule 3a-8, supra
note 328, at text before n.58 (“The Commission traditionally has viewed the fact that an issuer’s degree of control
over a company is greater than that of any other person as strong evidence that the issuer is engaged in a business
through the other company.”).
330 Id.
331 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(3)(i)(B). As noted in supra note 321, the surviving company would have to apply for
and be approved for listing by meeting the initial listing standards of a national securities exchange. Otherwise, it
could not be listed and traded on an exchange.
332 See supra Section I.
148
activities of its officers, directors and employees, its public representations of policies, and its
historical development.333 For example, the officers, directors and employees of a SPAC
wishing to rely on this safe harbor would need to be primarily focused on activities related to
seeking a target company to operate and not on activities related to the management of its
securities portfolio. These conditions incorporate three of the Tonopah factors and are intended,
together with the other conditions to the safe harbor, to ensure that a SPAC may only rely on the
safe harbor if it is primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting or
trading in securities. These factors are also similar to those used to determine the primary
engagement of a business in different contexts under the Investment Company Act.334
To rely on the safe harbor, the SPAC’s board of directors would also need to adopt an
appropriate resolution evidencing that the company is primarily engaged in the business of
seeking to complete a single de-SPAC transaction as described by the rule, and which is recorded
contemporaneously in its minute books or comparable documents.335 This condition is similar to
other exclusionary rules under the Investment Company Act in which the issuer may only rely on
the safe harbor provided by the rule if the issuer’s board of directors adopts an appropriate
resolution evidencing that the company is primarily engaged in a non-investment business.336

333 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(5)(i) through (iii). Such evidence may also include its articles of incorporation or other
formation documents.
334 See, e.g., Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company Act. As discussed previously, in addition to these factors,
the Tonopah factors also focus on the company’s assets and sources of income. See supra Section VI.A.1. While
proposed paragraph (a)(1) addresses the asset composition of SPACs wishing to rely on the safe harbor, the
proposed safe harbor does not include a separate condition specifically addressing a SPAC’s source of income
because the sources of income are addressed in the proposed rule’s limitations regarding the SPACs’ activities and
the types of assets it may acquire.
335 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(5)(iv).
336 See 17 CFR 270.3a-2 (Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act); Rule 3a-8 under the Investment Company
Act.
149
Such action serves to publicly document the intent of management and helps to establish a
shared understanding of shareholders concerning the business purpose of this issuer.
A SPAC relying on the proposed rule also may not hold itself out as being primarily
engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Given that SPACs
invest in the same types of securities as certain investment companies, such as money market
funds, a SPAC relying on the rule may not hold itself out, or otherwise suggest, that the SPAC
operates in a manner similar to these types of investment companies. For example, a SPAC
could not market itself as a means for gaining exposure to U.S. Treasury securities.
Request for Comment
129. Do SPACs engage in other activities that should be expressly permitted or prohibited by
the safe harbor? If yes, please explain these business activities and why they should be
permitted or prohibited.
130. As proposed, should the SPAC be required to seek a de-SPAC transaction in which the
surviving company is required either to directly or through a primarily controlled
company be primarily engaged in the business of the target company? Are the proposed
definitions of “surviving company” and “primarily controlled company” appropriate?
Should the proposed definitions be revised, and if so, how?
131. Should the safe harbor be limited to SPACs that seek de-SPAC transactions that result in
the surviving company having at least a majority interest in the target company?
Conversely, should the safe harbor permit the SPAC to seek a de-SPAC transaction in
which the surviving company is only required to control the target company? Are there
other approaches, such as requiring the de-SPAC transaction to result in a consolidation
of the SPAC and the target company?
150
132. As proposed, should we require that the surviving company be primarily engaged in the
business of operating the target company or companies? Is the use of the term “primarily
engaged” consistent with current business practices in this context? Should we instead
require that the surviving company be “solely” in the business of the target company or
companies? If so, how should “solely” be defined? Alternatively, should we require that
the surviving company be engaged in the business of the target company (and in activities
related or incidental thereto)?337
133. As proposed, should the SPAC be limited to only one de-SPAC transaction while relying
on the safe harbor? Why or why not? Similarly, should a SPAC, as proposed, be limited
to engaging in a combination with multiple target companies only if the combination
occurs as part of a single de-SPAC transaction with a single closing? Why or why not?
Should there be a limit on how many target companies may be part of a single de-SPAC
transaction? If so, what should that limit be and why? For example, would limiting the
safe harbor to two target companies strike an appropriate balance of the relevant
regulatory considerations?
134. As proposed, should we require a SPAC to be “primarily engaged” in the business of
seeking to complete a single de-SPAC transaction? Should we instead require that the
SPAC should be “solely” in the business of seeking to complete a single de-SPAC
transaction? Why or why not? Alternatively, should we require that the SPAC be
engaged in the business of seeking to complete a single de-SPAC transaction (and in
activities related or incidental thereto)?338

337 See generally Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act.
338 Id.
151
135. As drafted, the proposed rule would permit a SPAC relying on the safe harbor to seek to
engage in a de-SPAC transaction with any company other than an investment company.
Should the safe harbor further limit the types of companies in which a SPAC may seek a
de-SPAC transaction? For example, should a SPAC be precluded from seeking to engage
in a de-SPAC transaction with issuers relying on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7)?
Should a SPAC be precluded from seeking to engage in a de-SPAC transaction with
issuers relying on other exclusions under Section 3(c)? Should a SPAC be precluded
from seeking to engage in a de-SPAC transaction with issuers otherwise relying on an
exclusion or exemption by order from the definition of “investment company” by Section
3(b) or the rules or regulations under Section 3(a)? If so please identify which issuers
and why?
136. Should the rule include as evidence of the SPAC’s business purpose the SPAC’s
historical development given the SPAC’s short duration? Should the rule include, as
evidence of the SPAC’s business purpose, the SPAC’s public representation of policies
and the activities of its officers, directors and employees? Similarly, is it appropriate to
require the board of directors to adopt a resolution stating that the SPAC is primarily
engaged in the business of seeking to complete a de-SPAC transaction as described by
the rule? Should we require that the SPAC’s activities also, or instead, be evidenced by
its articles of incorporation, other formation documents or by-laws? If so, which
documents should be required? If a SPAC’s business purpose is evidenced in its
formation documents or by-laws, should we condition the proposed rule on those
provisions being subject to change only with the approval of shareholders? Should the
rule include a separate condition that addresses the SPAC’s sources of income? For
152
example, should a SPAC’s income be limited to that derived from assets in proposed
Rule 3a-10(a)(1)? Are any other conditions necessary to ensure that SPACs do not
convey to investors that they have attributes similar to investment companies? Given the
nature of a SPAC’s activities and the proposed conditions of the safe harbor, should the
proposed rule also include a condition providing that a SPAC must not be a special
situation investment company?339
137. Should we include a condition to the safe harbor that SPACs must disclose their intention
to rely on the safe harbor? Would such a condition be redundant to the disclosure
requirements under the Securities Act or under the Exchange Act? Should the safe
harbor include a condition that the SPAC’s board of directors must adopt a resolution
indicating that the SPAC intends to rely on the safe harbor?
3. Duration Limitations
To rely on the safe harbor, a SPAC would have a limited time period to announce and
complete a de-SPAC transaction. Specifically, the proposed rule would require a SPAC to file a
report on Form 8-K with the Commission announcing that it has entered into an agreement with
the target company (or companies) to engage in a de-SPAC transaction no later than 18 months
after the effective date of the SPAC’s registration statement for its initial public offering. The
SPAC must then complete the de-SPAC transaction no later than 24 months after the effective
date of its registration statement for its initial public offering.340 Following the completion of the

339 See Proposing Release to Rule 3a-1, supra note 298, at n.19 and accompanying text. See also In the Matter of
United Stores Corp., 10 S.E.C. 1145 (Feb. 12, 1942).
340 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(3)(ii) and (iii). As we discuss below, the average time between the announcement by a
SPAC of its intended de-SPAC transaction and the completion of that transaction is approximately 5 months. See
infra Section IX.B.6.
153
de-SPAC transaction, any assets that are not used in connection with the de-SPAC transaction
would need to be distributed in cash to investors as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.
The SPAC would also be required to distribute its assets in cash to investors as soon as
reasonably practicable if it does not meet either the 18-month deadline or the 24-month
deadline.341 Given that the time needed for such distribution in either case may be dependent on
facts and circumstances, we are not defining the term “reasonably practicable.” What is
reasonably practicable generally would depend on, among other things, any logistical or legal
limitations on an orderly, immediate return of funds to investors.
We are proposing these duration conditions mindful of the framework of the Investment
Company Act, the rules thereunder, and past Commission positions. The Investment Company
Act provides that any issuer that meets the definition of “investment company” must register and
be regulated under that Act unless the issuer can rely on an exclusion or exemption. The
Investment Company Act requires that an issuer will register and be subject to the Act’s
regulatory requirements once the issuer meets the definition.342 The Commission, however, has
in the past provided conditional, temporary relief to certain issuers that meet the definition of
“investment company” for only a short period of time. For example, Rule 3a-2 provides a oneyear safe harbor to so-called “transient investment companies,” which are issuers that, as a result
of an unusual business occurrence, may be considered an investment company under the
statutory definitions but intend to be engaged in a non-investment company business.343 In
 341 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(4).
342 See generally Sections 7(a) and 8(a) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-7(a); 15 U.S.C. 80a-8(a)]
343 See Transient Investment Companies, Release No. IC-11552 (Jan. 14, 1981) [46 FR 6882 (Jan. 22, 1981)]
(“Adopting Release to Rule 3a-2”). See Transient Investment Companies, Release No. IC-10943 (Nov. 16, 1979)
[44 FR 67152 (Nov. 23, 1979)], at text accompany nn 5-6 (“Proposing Release to Rule 3a-2”) (“Examples of
unusual business occurrences include: (1) a ‘start-up’ company’s investing its offering proceeds in securities while
arranging to purchase operating assets; (2) a company’s selling a large operating division and investing the proceeds
154
addition, as discussed previously, the Commission took the position that Rule 419 Accounts need
not be required to register as an investment company nor regulated as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act in part because the rule limits the duration of such accounts
to 18 months.344 The Commission has also at times granted short-term, conditional exemptive
relief under Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act345 to certain issuers that needed
additional time to restructure their businesses beyond that afforded by Rule 3a-2.346
Accordingly, the proposed rule would require a SPAC wishing to rely on the safe harbor
to enter into an agreement with a target company no later than 18 months after its initial public
offering, as evidenced by its filing a report on Form 8-K.347 A SPAC may enter into agreements
with additional target companies348 after the 18-month period provided that the business
combination contemplated by such later agreements are part of the de-SPAC transaction and all
of the transactions close contemporaneously within the 24 month period. The condition that the

in securities pending acquisition of additional operating assets; and (3) a company making a tender offer to
stockholders of a non-investment company and failing to obtain a majority of the target company’s stock.”).
344 See 17 CFR 230.419(e)(2)(iv) (“If a consummated acquisition(s) meeting the requirements [of Rule 419] has not
occurred by a date 18 months after the effective date of the initial registration statement, funds held in the escrow or
trust account shall be returned [to investors.]”). .
345 Section 6(c) gives the Commission the broad power to exempt conditionally or unconditionally any person,
security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act or any rule thereunder, provided that the exemption is
“necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of [the Act].” An applicant requesting such relief must explain in its
application that, given its particular facts and circumstances, the requested relief would meet the section’s standards.
See generally Amendments to Procedures With Respect to Applications Under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
Release No. IC-33921 (July 6, 2020) [85 FR 57089 (Sept. 15, 2020)].
346 See, e.g., General Electric Company and GE Capital International Holdings Ltd., Release No. IC-32477 (Feb.
13, 2017) [82 FR 11079 (Feb. 17, 2017)] (notice), Release No. IC-32532 (Mar. 13, 2017) (order).
347 See infra Section IX.B.6. (discussing baseline data regarding average duration). One press report suggests that
the average period of time between a SPAC’s initial public offering and the signing of its business combination
agreement may be decreasing, with the average such period of time being approximately 7.5 months for de-SPAC
transactions that closed in 2021. See “De-SPACs Still Popular But Becoming Harder To Close,” available at:
https://www.law360.com/mergersacquisitions/articles/1464716/de-spacs-still-popular-but-becoming-harder-to-close.
348 These additional agreements would need to be evidenced by the filing of a Form 8-K.
155
de-SPAC transaction close within 24 months is designed to allow SPACs to complete their stated
business purpose while balancing the risk that investors may come to view a SPAC holding
securities for a prolonged period as a fund-like investment, thereby necessitating the regulatory
protections of the Investment Company Act.
This timeframe is longer than the one-year timeframe of Rule 3a-2. We are proposing a
longer time frame under Rule 3a-10 because we understand that the search for a de-SPAC target
frequently takes more than one year and an issuer relying on Rule 3a-10 would be more
restricted in its business purpose and activities throughout the period of reliance than an issuer
relying on Rule 3a-2.349 This proposed timeframe reflects a consideration of the Tonopah
factors, including the factor that focuses on an issuer’s historical development as well as our
position with respect to Rule 419. While an issuer relying on Rule 3a-10 may have certain
characteristics resembling those of an investment company for a longer period than an issuer
relying on Rule 3a-2, its assets, income and purpose, and the activities of its officers and
directors, would be further restricted under the other conditions of Rule 3a-10. Accordingly, the
conditions are designed to work together to reduce the likelihood that investors will come to
view the SPAC as a fund-like investment. Nevertheless, we stress that the inability of a SPAC to
identify a target and complete a de-SPAC transaction within the proposed timeframe would raise
serious questions concerning the applicability of the Investment Company Act to that SPAC.
While we understand most SPACs commit to closing a de-SPAC transaction within 24
months, we also acknowledge that the duration limits we are proposing are shorter than the
 349 We stress that, for an issuer satisfying the safeguards tailored for transient investment companies under Rule 3a2, a company’s inability to become engaged primarily in a noninvestment company business within that rule’s one
year period would continue to raise serious questions concerning the applicability of the Investment Company Act to
that company. See Adopting Release to Rule 3a-2, supra note 343, at text following n.5. See also infra note 358
and accompanying text (quoting from Proposing Release to Rule 3a-2, supra note 343).
156
actual timeline of some SPACs that recently completed their de-SPAC transactions.350 We
understand that SPACs that choose to rely on the proposed safe harbor may need to seek to
identify and complete de-SPAC transactions on an accelerated timeline. Nonetheless, we are
concerned that, the longer the SPAC operates with its assets invested in securities and its income
derived from securities, the more likely investors will come to view the SPAC as a fund-like
investment and the more likely the SPAC appears to be deviating from its stated business
purpose.351 We have sought to strike a balance between providing flexibility for the SPAC to
pursue its stated purpose and recognizing that, beyond some horizon, the SPAC’s historical
development would become difficult to distinguish from that of an investment company. While
exchange listing rules contemplate potentially longer SPAC lifespans, those rules were adopted
for a different regulatory purpose.
The proposed rule would also require that any assets that are not used in connection with
the de-SPAC transaction be distributed in cash to SPAC shareholders as soon as reasonably
practicable after the completion of the de-SPAC transaction.352 Thus, in the event that the deSPAC transaction requires fewer assets than are owned by the SPAC, the SPAC would be unable
to seek another de-SPAC transaction with its remaining assets, or otherwise continue to operate
as a SPAC, even if the de-SPAC transaction met the duration conditions. As discussed
previously, a SPAC that is relying on the safe harbor would already be precluded from engaging
in more than one de-SPAC transaction pursuant to proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(3)(i). This separate
 350 See infra Section IX.B.6.
351 We also note that some SPACs in the past have sought an extension to their lifespan by obtaining approval of
their shareholders. The proposed rule does not provide for any extensions.
352 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(4)(i).
157
condition supplements that provision and is designed to ensure that a SPAC may not continue to
operate after its single de-SPAC transaction and still qualify for the safe harbor.
A SPAC seeking to rely on the safe harbor would also be required to distribute the
SPAC’s assets in cash to investors in the event that the SPAC fails to meet either the 18-month
or the 24-month deadline.353 As proposed, a SPAC would be required to distribute its assets in
cash to investors if the SPAC fails to enter into an agreement with a target company within 18
months even if it believes that it would complete a transaction within 24 months. This condition
would result in a SPAC that fails to meet these timing requirements either distributing its assets
as soon as reasonably practicable or registering as an investment company. In any event, such a
SPAC would not be permitted to continue to rely on the safe harbor.354
A SPAC would not be able to rely on Rule 3a-2 subsequent to its reliance on proposed
Rule 3a-10 in the event that it fails to meet either proposed Rule 3a-10’s 18-month or 24-month
time frame.
355 A failure to meet either timeframe would not constitute an unusual business
occurrence under that rule.356 In addition, Rule 3a-2 specifically states that the 12-month safe
harbor provided under that rule begins once the issuer acquires specified amounts of
securities.
357 Generally, the commencement date for reliance on Rule 3a-2 (and the 12 month
safe harbor provided under that rule) would have passed in the event a SPAC wished later to rely
on that rule subsequent to its reliance on proposed Rule 3a-10. Finally, both Rule 3a-2 and
proposed Rule 3a-10 are safe harbors that provide or would provide temporary relief to certain
 353 Proposed Rule 3a-10(a)(4)(ii).
354 Once a SPAC has distributed its assets, the SPAC must cease to operate as a SPAC, and it may not rely on the
safe harbor again.
355 The proposed rule would also preclude a SPAC from relying on proposed Rule 3a-10 after Rule 3a-2, because
the time period in the proposed rule begins on the effective date of its initial registration statement.
356 See supra note 343 and accompanying text.
357 Rule 3a-2(b).
158
issuers that may be investment companies, provided that, among other conditions, they transition
to a non-investment company business in a short period of time. When it was considering Rule
3a-2, the Commission was concerned that issuers could circumvent the Investment Company Act
by repeatedly relying on the Rule 3a-2 safe harbor, explaining that “where an issuer’s activities
would bring it within the definition of investment company more frequently than would be
permitted by the rule, the investor protection concerns of the Act would be relevant, the need for
shareholder protections would not be met, and there would be no persuasive public interest from
the standpoint of investors in permitting a non-transient investment company to avoid complying
with the prohibitions and regulatory provisions of the Act.”358 This concern would also arise if
SPACs were to rely on the Rule 3a-2 safe harbor following reliance on proposed Rule 3a-10.
Request for Comment
138. Should we require, as proposed, that the SPAC reach an agreement with at least one
target company within 18 months? Should we require that the SPAC reach an agreement
with at least one target company within 12 months, which would be more consistent with
the time period in Rule 3a-2? Should the time period be even shorter than 12 months
(e.g., 6 months)? Should the time period be longer (e.g., 20 months, 24 months, 36
months)? If the time period should be longer, please explain why such a longer period is
necessary and how any such longer period would be consistent with the framework of the
Investment Company Act, the rules thereunder, and prior Commission positions.
139. Is there an alternative way to limit the duration of the SPAC? Should we require that
such an agreement be evidenced by the filing of the Form 8-K? Should a SPAC be
 358 See Proposing Release to Rule 3a-2, supra note 343.
159
permitted, as proposed, to enter into agreements with other target companies after the 18
month period provided that all transactions close within 24 months?
140. Should we include an option for SPACs that have not identified a target within 18
months, or completed the de-SPAC transaction within 24 months to extend these
deadlines? If so, what would that be and what conditions should be included? For
example, should we provide that a SPAC can obtain an extra 2, 4 or 6 months and stay
within the safe harbor if it obtains approval from its shareholders? Please explain how
any extensions of these deadlines would be consistent with the framework of the
Investment Company Act, the rules thereunder, and prior Commission positions.
141. Should we require, as proposed, that the SPAC complete the de-SPAC transaction within
a 24-month period? Should the time period be 18 months, as in Rule 419 or 12 months,
as in Rule 3a-2? Should the period be longer (e.g., 30 months)? If so, how would that
longer period be consistent with the framework of the Investment Company Act, the rules
thereunder, and past Commission positions?
142. The rule proposal requires that any assets of the SPAC that are not used in connection
with the de-SPAC transaction, or in the event of the SPAC’s failure to meet the timelines
required for identification or completion of a de-SPAC transaction, be distributed in cash
to investors as soon as reasonably practicable. Should we allow distributions “in-kind”?
Are there any other distributions made by the SPAC that should be covered by the rule?
Should the rule text define the term “reasonably practicable”? If yes, how should the
term be defined? If the term “reasonably practicable” is not defined, could that
potentially result in unnecessarily extended periods of time before investor assets are
returned? Instead of defining the term “reasonably practicable,” should we specifically
160
require that such assets be distributed within a defined time period such as 30 days? 15
days? 7 days? Should we require the SPAC to provide notification to the Commission,
its investors and/or the SPAC’s board of directors if the distribution of cash takes longer
than a certain period of time, e.g., 30 days?
143. The proposed rule would require, following completion of a de-SPAC transaction, or in
the event that the SPAC failed to identify or complete a de-SPAC transaction, the SPAC
to distribute all remaining assets and cease operating as a SPAC. The proposed rule,
however, does not specifically mandate that the SPAC dissolve. Should we include this
requirement as a condition to the safe harbor? Why or why not?
144. In adopting Rule 3a-2, the Commission identified examples of companies that may be
able to rely on that safe harbor. These examples did not specifically include SPACs or
blank check companies. Are SPACs currently relying on Rule 3a-2 and, if so, what is the
basis for their reliance? Should the Commission provide guidance concerning, or amend
Rule 3a-2 to address, the ability of SPACs to rely on that safe harbor?
VII. ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR COMMENT
As discussed above, we believe that the proposed new rules and amendments would
enhance the disclosure requirements applicable to SPACs in initial public offerings and in deSPAC transactions and provide important investor protections in connection with de-SPAC
transactions. In considering the SPAC market as a whole, we are requesting comment on a
number of additional matters relating to the disclosures provided by SPACs, investor protection
measures, and the treatment of companies following a de-SPAC transaction.
161
145. Are there disclosure requirements that we have not proposed that would be helpful for
investors in SPACs at the initial public offering stage or at the de-SPAC transaction
stage?
146. Should the disclosure requirements and filer status determinations in a de-SPAC
transaction be the same no matter the de-SPAC structure? Do our proposals accomplish
this, or are there other disclosure requirements and filer status determinations impacted
by transaction structure that we should address?
147. What are the reasons, other than possible reporting outcomes, why a de-SPAC transaction
is structured so that an entity other than the SPAC is the acquirer and filing the
registration statement or proxy or information statement for the de-SPAC transaction?
Are there tax or other reasons that we should consider in relation to the proposed
amendments in this release and whether the disclosure requirements should be further
aligned across all de-SPAC transaction structures?
148. Should we consider amendments to other registration statement forms under the
Securities Act to require enhanced disclosures for offerings by SPACs that are similar to
those proposed above with respect to Form S-1 and F-1? Should we consider similar
amendments to Regulation A and Form 1-A?
149. The periodic reports filed by SPACs under the Exchange Act generally contain limited
information due to the absence of an operating business. Should some of the disclosure
requirements we are proposing also be required in the periodic reports filed by a SPAC
following its initial public offering? If so, which disclosures? Are there other disclosures
that we should require in the Exchange Act reports filed by a SPAC?
162
150. We note that the announcement of a prospective de-SPAC transaction often results in an
immediate and substantial increase in the trading volume of the securities of the SPAC,
based on the terms of the transaction that have been disclosed and the limited information
publicly available on the private operating company at the time of the announcement,
which is far less extensive than that of a newly public company after a traditional initial
public offering.
359 Should we consider requiring additional disclosures, such as more
disclosure on the private operating company or risk factor disclosure, in a Form 8-K filed
pursuant to Item 1.01 of the form disclosing that the parties have entered into a business
combination agreement? If so, what additional disclosure should we require? Should we
amend Item 1.01 of Form 8-K to require the filing of the business combination agreement
as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filing (as opposed to allowing the agreement to be filed as
an exhibit to a subsequent periodic report)? What other amendments should we consider
in this regard?
151. Currently, the post-business combination company is required to file a Form 8-K with
Form 10 information within four business days after the completion of a de-SPAC
transaction. Should we require the filing of this Form 8-K within a shorter time frame in
order to reduce the gap in timing between the completion of the transaction and the
public availability of this information in the Form 8-K?
152. Are there other rule changes the Commission should consider to enhance investor
protections in initial public offerings by SPACs and in de-SPAC transactions?
 359 According to one study, institutional investors typically purchase the vast majority of the securities in a SPAC’s
initial public offering and are far more likely to redeem their shares instead of reselling the shares, resulting in
limited secondary market trading of SPAC shares. Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17.
163
• We have not proposed requirements for SPAC offerings comparable to those
applicable to blank check companies under Rule 419. Should we consider requiring
SPACs to comply with conditions similar to those in Rule 419? If so, which
conditions?
• The shareholders of a SPAC are permitted to vote in favor of a proposed de-SPAC
transaction while redeeming their shares prior to the closing of the transaction and
retaining their warrants, such that the vote is decoupled from any continuing share
ownership in the post-business combination company (unless and until the warrants
are exercised).
360 Should the Commission adopt rule changes or other approaches to
address this situation? For example, should the Commission condition the continued
availability of an exclusion from the requirements of Rule 419 on whether
shareholders voting to approve a de-SPAC transaction retain an economic interest in
the combined company? Should we address this issue through the Commission’s
authority under Section 19(c) of the Exchange Act to adopt rules applicable to
national securities exchanges?
153. A post-business combination company following a de-SPAC transaction is subject to
different treatment under various rules based on its status as a former shell company. For
example, a post-business combination company following a de-SPAC transaction is an
“ineligible issuer,” based on its status as a former shell company, which prevents the
company from using free writing prospectuses pursuant to Securities Act Rules 164 and
433 for a three-year period.361 As a former shell company, the post-business combination
 360 See Rodrigues and Stegemoller, supra note 17.
361 See Securities Act Rule 164(e)(1).
164
company is also ineligible to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for a 60-day period
following the de-SPAC transaction,362 and the safe harbor in Rule 139 for broker-dealer
research reports is not available for research reports on the post-business combination
company for a three-year period.363 In this regard, we note that the treatment of former
shell companies under these rules is based on heightened concerns regarding fraud and
other abuses surrounding many shell company transactions. To better align de-SPAC
transactions with initial public offerings, should we consider amending these and other
rules relating to former shell companies to treat companies that have become public
companies through a de-SPAC transaction in the same or similar manner as those that
have completed traditional initial public offerings? Should we differentiate SPACs from
other shell companies in applying these rules? If so, on what basis?
154. Are there areas relating to SPACs where additional Commission guidance would be
helpful? For example, would it be useful if the Commission reiterated or expanded upon
the Commission staff’s guidance in 2020 and 2021 regarding SPACs?364
VIII. GENERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENTS
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments on any aspect of
our proposals, other matters that might have an impact on the proposed amendments, and any
suggestions for additional changes. With respect to any comments, we note that they are of
greatest assistance if accompanied by supporting data and analysis of the issues addressed in
those comments and by alternatives to our proposals where appropriate.

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
We are mindful of the costs and benefits of these proposed new rules and amendments.
The discussion below addresses the potential economic effects of the proposed new rules and
amendments, including the likely benefits and costs, as well as the potential effects on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation.365 We have analyzed the expected economic effects of the
proposed new rules and amendments relative to the current baseline, which consists of the
existing regulatory framework of disclosure requirements and liability provisions, current market
practices, and the distribution of participants by type.
As discussed above, we are proposing new rules and amendments to existing rules that
are intended to enhance investor protections in SPAC registered offerings, including initial
public offerings, and in de-SPAC transactions. The proposed new rules and amendments would
require disclosures with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts
of interest, dilution, and the fairness of de-SPAC transactions. The proposed new rules and
amendments would also revise certain rules and forms under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act to specify their application in the context of de-SPAC transactions, including, among other
things, a proposed rule that a SPAC and a target company be treated as co-registrants when a
SPAC files a registration statement for a de-SPAC transaction and a proposed rule that addresses
the underwriter status of SPAC IPO underwriters in any subsequently registered de-SPAC
transaction.
 365 Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78c(f)],
and Section 2(c) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(c)] require the Commission, when engaging in
rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in (or, with
respect to the Investment Company Act, consistent with) the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection
of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further, Section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)] requires the Commission, when making rules under the
Exchange Act, to consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the Commission from
adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
Exchange Act.
166
Additional proposed rules are intended to align de-SPAC transactions more closely with
initial public offerings. One would require certain non-financial disclosures regarding the target
private operating company that are typically filed on Form 8-K within 4 days after the
completion of a de-SPAC transaction to be included in the disclosures that are filed in
connection with an anticipated de-SPAC transaction (Form S-4 or F-4, a proxy or information
statement, or a Schedule TO). The other would require the surviving entity following a deSPAC transaction to re-determine its eligibility for smaller reporting company status within four
business days of the completion of the transaction.
We are also proposing new rules and amendments that would apply to shell companies
more broadly. Proposed Rule 145a would deem any business combination involving a reporting
shell company that is not a business combination related shell company, and another entity that is
not a shell company, to involve a sale of securities to the reporting shell company’s shareholders.
In addition, the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X are intended to more closely align the
financial statement requirements in business combinations between a shell company (other than a
business combination related shell company) and a non-shell company with those required on
Forms S-1 or F-1 for an initial public offering.
Furthermore, we are proposing to: (i) amend Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K to expand and
update our views with respect to projections used in Commission filings; (ii) require additional
disclosures regarding projections when disclosed in connection with de-SPAC transactions; and
(iii) amend the definition of “blank check company” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbor for
forward-looking statements, such that the safe harbor would not be available for projections by
blank check companies that are not penny stock issuers, which would include SPACs and target
companies in de-SPAC transactions. Finally, we are proposing to create a safe harbor from the
167
definition of “investment company” under the Investment Company Act for SPACs that meet
certain conditions.
Overall, we expect the proposed new rules and amendments relating to SPAC
transactions, in particular, and in some cases to shell company business combinations more
broadly, to provide investors366 with improved and, in some instances, potentially earlier367
access to more consistent, comprehensive, and readily comparable information and to enhance
their ability to make more informed investment decisions, which can lead to more efficient
pricing of securities.368 Both public reporting companies seeking to make an acquisition (SPACs
or other shell or blank check companies, in some cases) and target private operating companies
may incur costs related to the production and public disclosure of the proposed required
information; however, these costs may be mitigated to the extent that either party may already
voluntarily produce or provide such information in response to evolving market demands.369 We
further anticipate that addressing the liability of various parties in de-SPAC transactions or other
shell company business combinations could encourage those parties to exercise greater care in
either the selection of an intended target company or the preparation and review of the required
disclosures. This could result in more reliable information for investors regarding a private

366 Throughout this section, “investor” can refer to any current or a potential shareholder of a company, though it is
generally understood costs and benefits may accrue to such investors heterogeneously based on size, sophistication,
and affiliation.

368 See, e.g., Orie E. Barron & Hong Qu, Information Asymmetry and the Ex Ante Impact of Public Disclosure
Quality on Price Efficiency and the Cost of Capital: Evidence from a Laboratory Market, 89 ACCOUNTING REV.

company target at the time of a transaction, and would further align the protections afforded to
investors with those of an initial public offering.
To the extent that the proposed rules would also provide better, more readily accessible
information about SPACs, they may result in less adverse selection than might otherwise occur
at the de-SPAC transaction. Overall, we expect the proposals may enhance the protection of
investors, as well as promote market efficiency. We are mindful that some aspects of this
rulemaking may deter some forms of communications or some transactions that might otherwise
be efficient or to the economic benefit of issuers and investors. They also may deter some
business combinations that otherwise would have created value. We discuss these considerations
in more detail below.
In many cases, we are unable to quantify the relative magnitudes of various economic
effects because we lack information to quantify such effects with a reasonable degree of
accuracy. Where we are unable to quantify the economic effects of the proposed new rules and
amendments, we have provided a qualitative assessment of the potential effects and encourage
commenters to provide data, studies, reports and other information that would help quantify the
benefits, costs, and potential impacts on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.370
A. Broad Economic Considerations
Although a significant level of information asymmetry exists when a private company
“goes public,” the traditional initial public offering process (IPO) has developed mechanisms
 370 For our estimates of the paperwork burdens associated with the proposed rules and amendments for purposes of
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”), please see Section X below. These PRA burden estimates pertain to
“collections of information” as that term is defined in the PRA, and therefore reflect only the hours and costs to
prepare required disclosures and maintain records. As a result, these estimates do not reflect the full economic
effects or full scope of economic costs of the proposed rules and amendments that are discussed in this analysis.
169
that can alleviate adverse selection problems.371 Those mechanisms include mandated public
disclosures, staff review of registration statements,
372 and the effects of Section 11 liability,
which, among other things, motivates due diligence performed by underwriters, accountants, and
other offering participants. These mechanisms generally lead to lower levels of information
asymmetry, which can improve the security’s pricing and placement efficiency and encourages
investor participation in the IPO market. The traditional IPO process, however, is associated
with costs, which could be significant for certain firms. Those costs can be direct, in the form of
fees, or indirect in the form of underpricing, as has long been recognized in the academic
literature.373
Alternative ways374 of going public have emerged that may allow companies to avoid
some of the costs of the traditional initial public offering process, though this also might involve
 371 Adverse selection is sometimes described as the ‘lemons’ problem: when buyers have less information than
sellers, their bids will be lower to reflect this uncertainty. In response, the sellers of high quality products may exit
the market, causing further decline in buyers’ willingness to pay, which could cause a market failure. See, e.g.,
George Akerlof, The Market for “Lemons”: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism, 84 QTR. J. ECON. 488
(1970).
372 This review includes benefits such as, for example, the production of additional valuable information in response
to comments issued by the Commission staff during the filing reviews. See, e.g., Michelle Lowry, Roni Michaely,
& Ekaterina Volkova, Information Revealed Through the Regulatory Process: Interactions Between the SEC and
Companies Ahead of Their IPO, 33 REV. FIN. STUD. 5510 (2020).
373 See Alexander Ljungqvist, Chapter 7 - IPO Underpricing, in 1 HANDBOOK OF EMPIRICAL CORPORATE FINANCE
375 (B. Espen Eckbo ed., 2007); Kevin Rock, Why New Issues are Underpriced, 15 J. FIN. ECON. 187 (1986); Tim
Loughran & Jay Ritter, Why Has IPO Underpricing Changed Over Time?, 33 FIN. MGMT. 5 (2004).
374 While equity in a private company might also become publicly traded by participation in a roll-up, because such
transactions typically involve multiple companies and the surviving entity thus may resemble each of the rolled-up
entities less specifically, individually, we do not consider this a comparable way of going public for the purposes of
our discussion. Additionally, a handful of companies have listed their shares directly on a national securities
exchange without the use of a traditional underwriter and without raising capital. As with participation in a roll-up,
this method of accessing the public markets is not frequently used. From 2018 through 2021, only twelve
companies went public using this approach. (This Commission estimate includes 9 direct listings on NYSE and 3
direct listings on Nasdaq that occurred on or before Dec. 31, 2021.) In December 2020, the Commission issued an
order approving a proposed rule change submitted by New York Stock Exchange LLC (NYSE) that would allow
private companies to list on the NYSE via a direct listing and raise capital at the same time. See Release No. 34-
90768 (Dec. 22, 2020) [85 FR 85807 (Dec. 29, 2020)] (SR-NYSE-2019-67). In May 2021, the Commission
approved a similar proposed rule change submitted by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. See Release No. 34-91947
(May 19, 2021) [86 FR 28169 (May 25, 2021)] (SR-NASDAQ-2020-057). While, it is possible that the number of
companies that would seek to offer securities via direct listing will increase following these recent regulatory
170
forgoing some of the benefits typically considered desirable by market participants (e.g.,
potentially better pricing due to underwriter help with the placement of securities as well as more
robust due diligence and disclosure).375 While pursuit of these alternatives suggest private
operating companies are interested in accessing the benefits of being publicly traded, it is not
clear that these alternatives represent net improvements in the mechanism design of the
traditional IPO process.
One way a private company may become a public reporting company is via merger with
a shell company that has already obtained exchange listing, quotation, or otherwise registered a
class of securities under the Exchange Act. In recent years, a significant number of private
companies have opted to become a public reporting company via a merger with a particular kind
of shell company, a SPAC. SPACs have been in existence since the 1990s, and though their use
by private companies as an alternative mechanism for becoming a public reporting company has
varied over time, it has increased dramatically in the past three years. We estimate that in the
past year alone, approximately 200 companies have become listed on an exchange via a deSPAC transaction, which is slightly more than a sevenfold increase since 2019 and a twentyfold
increase since 2015.
376
As with a traditional IPO, becoming a public reporting company through a de-SPAC
transaction might also be subject to adverse selection given that this type of transaction is
associated with significant information asymmetries between public investors in the SPAC and

changes, it is unclear that future use would become comparable in purpose or scope to mergers with shell companies
as an alternative means to access the public market. See Release No. 34-94311 (Feb. 24, 2022) [87 FR 11780 (Mar.
2, 2022)] (SR-NASDAQ-2021-045) (order disapproving proposed rule change to modify certain price limitations in
a direct listing with a capital raise).
375 See, e.g., James Brau & Stanley Fawcett, Initial Public Offerings: An Analysis of Theory and Practice, 61 J. FIN.
399 (2006).
376 Staff review of Form 8-K filings identified 28 private operating companies acquired in calendar year 2019 and
10 in calendar year 2015 that could be confirmed in the Dealogic M&A module as a de-SPAC transaction.
171
the private company that the SPAC intends to acquire. Public SPAC investors could rely on
various mechanisms to overcome the adverse selection problem in the SPAC context: the
contingent nature of sponsor compensation; the right to vote to approve a de-SPAC transaction
or redeem shares; projections regarding anticipated future performance, to the extent they
improve price formation; potential liability; and any additional unregistered investments by
investors at the de-SPAC transaction stage.377 While in some cases, a private company might
prefer these alternative mechanisms to a traditional IPO, their general efficacy in resolving the
problems or costs of information asymmetry might, in practice, be limited.378
Some economic theorists have argued that the structure of SPAC sponsor compensation
may efficiently incentivize transactions that benefit investors,
379 but the effects in practice may
be more ambiguous. On one hand, because almost all of the SPAC sponsor’s compensation is
contingent on the completion of a de-SPAC transaction, the sponsors may therefore have an
incentive to select target companies that would maximize their own, as well as investors’, returns
at exit. As noted above, however, there is also a potential conflict of interest for sponsors
precisely because their compensation (e.g., 20% promote) is dependent on the completion of a
de-SPAC transaction.
380 This could create an incentive to enter into unfavorable, or less
favorable, de-SPAC transactions than would otherwise be optimal for the SPAC’s unaffiliated
shareholders because the sponsor’s alternative to a de-SPAC transaction is to liquidate the
 379 For a detailed description of the SPAC process, see Section I.
378 In addition to the potentially problematic incentives embedded in the SPAC structure as described in the
following sections, we further acknowledge that in some cases management and other insiders in target companies
may find that a de-SPAC transaction is a more attractive option for becoming a public reporting company than a
traditional initial public offering for reasons that conflict more directly with adequate investor protections. These
reasons may include the lack of a named underwriter or actionable liability.
379 See, e.g., Sris Chatterjee, N.K. Chidambaran, Gautam Goswami, Security design for a non-standard IPO: The
case of SPACs, 69 J. INT’L MONEY & FIN. 151 (2016).
380 See supra note 12.
172
SPAC, and return the initial public offering proceeds, forfeiting their potential promote. While
reputational concerns may be a mitigating source of discipline, sponsors may also be more likely
to prioritize private benefits when these concerns are less pressing; for example, in periods when
the market is broadly less risk-averse or if the sponsor does not intend to pursue serial SPAC
activities.
In addition, voting rights and redemption rights may protect SPAC investors, because
SPAC investors have the right to vote against a de-SPAC transaction and may redeem their
shares if they believe holding shares in the combined company is not in their best interest.381
However, these rights can also create potential conflicts of interest between non-redeeming
shareholders and shareholders who choose to redeem shares but continue to hold warrants.
When SPAC investors redeem the shares but retain and later exercise the warrants of the initial
IPO unit, the equity shares of the non-redeeming shareholders are diluted relative to what they
would be absent such exercise. A further conflict may arise because the value of the warrants is
enhanced by greater volatility of the underlying security. Thus, warrant-holders may incur
greater financial benefits from high-risk mergers in a manner that may not be aligned with the
interests of the non-redeeming SPAC investors. Additionally, in cases where the SPAC is
structured so that the shareholders are able to vote in favor of a merger but also redeem their
shares, this could present a moral hazard problem, in economic terms, because these redeeming
shareholders would not bear the full cost of a less than optimal choice of target.
The use of projections regarding the future earnings and performance of the target
company in the de-SPAC transaction may be another mechanism that helps SPAC investors
 381 For listed SPACs, existing exchange listing standards, if a shareholder vote is held, require public shareholders
voting against a de-SPAC transaction to have the right to redeem their shares if the de-SPAC transaction is approved
and consummated. See infra Section IX.B.1.a. SPACs have often extended this redemption right to shareholders
voting in favor of the de-SPAC transaction as well.
173
overcome adverse selection, insofar as they provide information that could improve price
formation. However, there may also be conflicts of interest associated with those projections
given some features of the SPAC structure. The need to secure shareholder approval and meet
the respective exchange listing’s valuation requirement382 to complete the de-SPAC transaction
may imply that it is in the target company’s interest to present the most favorable projections of
its future performance. SPAC sponsors’ interests in completing the de-SPAC transaction in
order to receive their compensation could also affect the degree to which they would be
motivated to scrutinize or question a target company’s projections.
383 Additionally, the basis,
source, and support for any projections may not be adequately disclosed to shareholders, thereby
limiting their value. For example, there may be confusion among some practitioners as to
whether Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K, which states the Commission’s views regarding the
reasonableness of projections, applies to projections regarding the target company’s future
performance that may be included in the SPAC’s filings.
Applicable liability provisions may also provide some protections for SPAC investors.
For example, SPACs are liable for material misstatements or omissions in their proxy
solicitations under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 of the Exchange Act. However, such liability
generally requires proof of negligence. Similarly, SPAC investors may be protected by the
application of Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act for material misstatements or
omissions made in connection with SPAC transactions involving the filing of a registration
 382 See infra Section IX.B.1.a.
383 See supra note 67 and accompanying text.
174
statement. However, as discussed above, there are potential gaps or inconsistencies in these
protections that the proposed amendments are intended to address.384
Another mechanism that could help investors overcome the adverse selection problem is
the potential signal of deal quality implied by the presence of PIPE investors.
385 These investors,
who are generally institutional investors, are often afforded an opportunity to gain considerable
insight into the details of a de-SPAC transaction and the future financial prospects of the target
company (subject to confidentiality agreements) for purposes of evaluating whether to
participate in a PIPE that often occurs close in time to a de-SPAC transaction. Public SPAC
investors could benefit from the participation of PIPE investors in a de-SPAC transaction in a
number of ways. At present, some PIPE investments in connection with de-SPAC transactions
function as a backstop to offset high levels of redemption, thereby ensuring a de-SPAC
transaction does not fail to meet the minimum cash requirement necessary to complete its
intended business combination. In other cases, PIPE investments enable the SPAC to acquire a
larger target, or one with a higher valuation, giving SPAC IPO investors access to a different
type of target company than they might otherwise be able to acquire.
386 On the other hand, the
presence of PIPE investors in a de-SPAC transaction may not benefit public SPAC investors
because they typically invest at a discount. When a de-SPAC redemption rate is high, the PIPE
discount can exacerbate the dilution of the equity position of the SPAC’s non-redeeming
 384 See supra Sections III.C & III.F.
385 See, e.g., Mike Hopkins & Donald G. Ross, Key Drivers of Private Equity Firm Certification at Initial Public
Offering, 16 J. PRIVATE EQUITY, 69 (2013).
386 This role of PIPEs has been more common, historically, see, e.g., Vijay M. Jog & Chengye Sun, Blank Check
IPOs: A Home Run for Management (SSRN Working Paper, 2007) (“the median value of the transaction in relation
to gross proceeds is approximately 178 percent, meaning that the size of the acquisition is higher than the proceeds
raised through the IPO since many [blank check companies] raised additional debt to finance the acquisitions”), and
could be a contributing factor to the differences we continue to observe between average capital raised via SPAC
IPO (see infra Section IX.B.6.a) and PIPE financing (see infra Section IX.B.2.c) and the average consideration paid
per SPAC target (see infra Section IX.B.2.c).
175
shareholders. Additionally, because PIPEs may, in some cases, involve the purchase of only
warrants, similar misalignments of incentives with respect to a de-SPAC transaction may occur
with this category of warrant-only holders as those previously discussed in that they may have
incentives to pursue riskier targets than would be optimal for a non-redeeming SPAC
shareholder. As such, the PIPE’s financial participation in a de-SPAC transaction may not be a
reliable indication that the transaction would benefit unaffiliated SPAC investors.
Therefore, while a number of the mechanisms associated with a SPAC transaction
structure could mitigate adverse selection concerns for investors and could, theoretically,
improve the process by which private companies may become publicly traded, many of their
potential benefits over the traditional IPO process may be mitigated by countervailing conflicts
of interest. As a result of the complexity inherent in the SPAC structure, investors may lack or
otherwise be unable to readily decipher critical information regarding certain financial incentives
(such as contingent sponsor or IPO underwriter compensation or the potential dilutive effects of
PIPE financing) of the SPAC, the target company, their respective affiliates, or other parties in a
manner necessary to properly assess the value of an investment position.
There is also a question of whether investors, particularly retail investors, fully
understand the costs involved in de-SPAC transactions and how these costs may affect investors’
post-de-SPAC transaction returns on their original investments. Specifically, investors may not
fully anticipate the dilutive effects of sponsor compensation (the “promote”), PIPE financing,
and outstanding warrants following de-SPAC transactions. In a similar vein, the potential
uncertainty regarding the availability of the PSLRA safe harbor and the applicability of the
guidance of Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K to projections of a target company in a de-SPAC
transaction may result in the use of unreasonable or aspirational projections in connection with
176
de-SPAC transactions that may misrepresent the benefits and risks involved in such transactions.
Furthermore, while the SPAC vehicle may allow a private company to go public without using
the traditional IPO process, the disclosure regarding the private company provided in connection
with a de-SPAC transaction may be less complete or less reliable than that provided in a
traditional IPO for reasons discussed in the release, including, among other reasons, the lack of
due diligence by traditional gatekeepers, such as underwriters.
387 By strengthening investor
protection, the proposed rules could increase investors’ confidence in SPAC transactions, while
keeping this alternative route of going public attractive for private companies.
In addition to the SPAC-specific items that are of central concern to this proposal, we are
also proposing amendments to address further areas of incongruity in requirements that guide the
disclosures and liabilities in the broader context of shell-company mergers and the use of
projections. For example, proposed Rule 145a would help investors in reporting shell companies
more consistently receive the full protections of the Securities Act disclosure and liability
provisions in business combinations involving shell companies, regardless of the transaction
structure. Reporting shell companies would have to register offerings subject to proposed Rule
145a by filing a Securities Act registration statement unless there is an applicable exemption.
Additionally, we are proposing new Article 15 of Regulation S-X and amendments to our forms,
schedules, and rules to more closely align the financial statement reporting requirements in
business combinations involving a shell company and a private operating company with those in
traditional initial public offerings. For example, we are proposing to align the number of fiscal
years required to be included in the financial statements for a private company that will be the
 387 Although as discussed above, a court could find that many parties to a de-SPAC transaction may meet the
definition of “underwriter,” all of these issues may be compounded by the lack of a designated underwriter in deSPAC transactions that could perform due diligence and would be subject to liability under Section 11 of the
Securities Act.
177
predecessor(s) in a shell company combination with the financial statements required to be
included in a Securities Act registration statement for an initial public offering of equity
securities in proposed Regulation S-X Rule 15-01(b). Other proposed amendments would codify
certain current staff guidance for transactions involving shell companies.
In our analysis below, we first discuss the proposed provisions that pertain to specialized
disclosure requirements for SPACs in registered offerings and for de-SPAC transactions and then
address the proposals concerning liability related to de-SPAC transactions and the PSLRA safe
harbor. We then analyze the impact of the proposed new rules and amendments that would
apply to shell companies and to the use of projections in Commission filings. Finally, we discuss
the proposed safe harbor for SPACs from being deemed an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Where appropriate, we discuss the interactions between the proposed
new rules and amendments.
B. Baseline and Affected Parties
To assess the economic impact of the proposed rules, the Commission uses as its baseline
the current regulatory framework and existing market practices, including Commission staff
guidance and other staff positions. We discuss in this section those parties likely to be affected
by the proposed rules and some of the relevant regulatory and market baselines. The remainder
of the discussion of the regulatory and market baselines is integrated into our analysis of the
benefits and costs of the proposed rules to aid comprehension and minimize repetition.388
1. SPAC Initial Public Offerings
The parties most likely to be directly affected by the proposed rules regarding specialized
disclosure requirements for SPACs in initial public offerings and other registered offerings are
 388 See also supra Sections I-IV for further discussion of existing regulatory framework and market practices.
178
existing or potential sponsors intending to organize a new SPAC, SPACs, prospective investors
in such offerings, and any other market participants whose service or activities involve analysis
of the information, data, and disclosures related to SPACs and their sponsors in these offerings.
In 2021, there were approximately 620 SPAC initial public offerings.
In addition, these proposed amendments would necessarily have secondary impacts on
the prospects or opportunities of private companies that would be potential targets of such newly
organized SPACs if, as a result of their adoption, a different number or type of SPAC sponsors
and their affiliates participate in the market. Similarly, given that proposed Rule 140a clarifies
the underwriter status of SPAC IPO underwriters at the de-SPAC transaction stage, this proposed
rule may affect the number and type of potential targets that might be selected for acquisition by
potentially reducing the number of SPAC IPOs underwriters are willing to support or by
potentially deterring SPAC IPO underwriters from directly or indirectly participating in the deSPAC transaction or any related financing transaction.
389 Other potentially affected parties
include those parties who provide advisory or other services to sponsors of SPACs in connection
with these registered offerings.
a. SPAC Initial Public Offerings and Exchange Listing
SPACs initial public offerings on national securities exchanges have greatly increased in
recent years. Moreover, SPAC listings have migrated from the over-the-counter market to three
national securities exchanges: first NYSE American (formerly AMEX), then Nasdaq and NYSE
(see Table 1).
390
 389 See Jessica Bai, Angela Ma, and Miles Zheng, Reaching for Yield in the Going-Public Market: Evidence from
SPACs (SSRN Working Paper, 2021).
390 SPACs first were listed on the AMEX in 2005. The Commission approved the NYSE’s proposed rule change to
adopt listing standards to permit the listing of SPACs on May 6, 2008, and approved NASDAQ’s proposal to adopt

that conducted an initial public offering with a confirmed pricing date as of December 30,2021.
NYSE, Nasdaq, and NYSE American have rules setting forth listing requirements for a
company whose business plan is to complete an IPO and engage in a de-SPAC transaction.391
Among other things, all three exchanges permit the initial listing of SPACs only if at least 90%
of the gross proceeds from the IPO and any concurrent sale by the SPAC of equity securities will
be deposited in a trust account.392 These exchanges further require that within three years, for
NYSE, or 36 months, for Nasdaq and NYSE American, of the effectiveness of its IPO
registration statement (or such shorter period specified in the registration statement under Nasdaq
and NYSE American rules or its constitutive documents or by contract under NYSE rules), the

SPAC complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at
least 80% of the value of the net assets in the account excluding certain costs.393 NYSE, Nasdaq,
and NYSE American require that a de-SPAC transaction meeting the 80% requirement be
approved by a majority of the SPAC’s independent directors,394 and all three exchanges require,
if a shareholder vote is held, that a majority of the shares voted at the shareholder meeting
approve the de-SPAC transaction meeting the 80% requirement.395 In addition, if a de-SPAC
transaction meeting the 80% requirement is approved and consummated, public shareholders
voting against the transaction must have the right to convert their shares of common stock into a
pro rata share of the aggregate amount then in the trust account net taxes and working capital
disbursements.396 If a shareholder vote on a de-SPAC transaction is not held, the SPAC must
provide all shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all their shares for cash equal to their pro
rata share of the aggregate amount then in the trust account net of taxes and working capital
disbursements, pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which
regulate issuer tender offers.397
b. SPAC Sponsors

attractive route to the public markets was the benefit of the leadership and professional advice by

one or more individuals comprising the SPAC sponsor, including in some cases beyond the deSPAC and into the life of the target as public operating company.
398 Although the majority of
sponsors are financial institutions, a sizable fraction (47%) of SPACs are sponsored by
individuals.
Figure 1. Distribution of SPACs by Sponsor Type, 2019-2021a
a Data presents the average composition of SPAC offerings by sponsor type as categorized by SPAC Insider. See
SPAC Insider, 1H 2021 SPAC Report (2021). Note, sponsor composition data for 2021 SPAC sponsorship reflects
only data through end second quarter.
c. SPAC IPO Underwriters
During the period 1990-2021, the average number of underwriters participating in a
SPAC IPO was 2.5.399 Approximately 99% of these SPAC IPOs were done via a firm
 398 See Robert Berger, SPACs: An Alternative Way to Access the Public Markets, 20 J. APPLIED CORPORATE FIN. 68
(2008) (“Though privately negotiated, tailored transactions, SPACs can provide companies with access to the public
markets in ways that a traditional IPO cannot. SPAC mergers typically exhibit … specialized SPAC management
teams that add experience that is difficult to replicate.”).

commitment offering.400 The average fee charged by SPAC IPO underwriters during this time
was approximately 5.6%.
401 This reflects a decline from the underwriting fees associated with
the earliest SPACs (approximately 7-7.5%),402 when underwriters typically received their full
compensation at the time of the SPAC IPO.
403 As mentioned above, a portion of this fee is
typically deferred until, and conditioned upon, the completion of the de-SPAC transaction.
404 In
a typical SPAC underwriting, this deferred fee is placed in the SPAC trust or escrow account.
During the period 1990-2021, we estimate that the average size of the deferred underwriter fee
was 3.4%.
405 We do not observe significant differences in the structure or level of underwriter
fees and deferred fees, as disclosed at the IPO stage, between SPACs that have completed a deSPAC transaction and those that have not. We observe that among SPACs that have completed a
de-SPAC transaction the average number of underwriters was 3.1, which is slightly higher than
the average number of underwriters per SPAC IPO.
406 SPAC underwriters may provide other
services to the SPAC or its eventual target after the IPO as well. For example, the SPAC
underwriter may help the SPAC identify potential targets, provide financial advisory services to
the SPAC or the target, or act as a PIPE placement agent.
d. Warrants
 400 SPACs that conduct a firm commitment IPO and raise more than $5 million in the offering are not subject to the
requirements of Securities Act Rule 419. See supra note 12.
401 This estimate is based on staff analysis of data as described in Table 1, note a.
402 See, e.g., Lola Miranda Hale, SPAC: A Financing Tool with Something for Everyone, 18 J. CORP. ACCT. & FIN.
67 (2007) (“The underwriting discounts are typically around 7-7.5 percent of the public offering price”).
403 See Yochanan Shachmurove & Milos Vulanovic, Specified Purpose Acquisition Company IPOs, in THE OXFORD
HANDBOOK OF IPOS (Douglas Cumming ed., 2018).
404 See supra Section III.E.3.
405 This estimate is based on staff analysis of data as described in Table 1, note a, and may be positively skewed
because the data features a greater proportion of deals occurring between 2019 and 2021.
406 Based on staff analysis of data as described in Table 1, note a. We note that timing differences in where a SPAC
might currently be, relative to its dissolution date, might result in overestimation of this difference.
183
SPAC IPOs most often register the offering of a unit composed of a common share,
warrants, or fractions thereof, and—in some cases—rights.407 In their earliest form, SPAC units
usually included two in-the-money warrants exercisable for full shares at the later of completion
of the de-SPAC transaction or one year after the effective date of the IPO registration
statement.
408 These warrants could thus become highly dilutive to the equity shareholders given
that warrants may begin trading separately from the unit common share once a Form 8-K
containing the balance sheet of IPO proceeds has been filed.409 Shareholders could experience
equity dilution if redeeming shareholders retain and later exercise their warrants.
 407 See, e.g. Gül Okutan Nilsson, Incentive Structure of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, 19 EUR BUS ORG
Law Review (2018) (“[R]ecent SPACs seem to be experimenting with issuing certain ‘rights’ [. . .] defined as the
‘right to receive one-tenth of a SPAC share upon consummation of the business combination’ Unlike in the case of
warrants, shareholders are not required to pay for receiving these shares. ‘Rights can also trade separately and even
the shareholders who convert their shares can keep them. If the business combination cannot be completed, rights
expire worthless.”).
408 See, e.g., Hale, supra note 402 (“The typical structure involves the offering of a unit consisting of common stock
and one or two separate warrants for common stock. In a two-warrant unit, the unit price is $6, including one share
of common stock and two warrants.[. . .] Typically, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of
common stock at a price of $5 each.”); Carol Boyer & Glenn Baigent, SPACs as Alternative Investments: An
Examination of Performance and Factors that Drive Prices, 11 J. PRIVATE EQUITY 8 (2008) (“SPACs typically sell
in units that are priced at $6, and each unit is composed of one common share and two warrants that give investors
the right to buy two more shares for $5 each.”).
409 Historically, this typically occurred around 90 days after the initial public offering. Over the past decade, the
usual number of days has decreased to approximately 60. See, e.g., Anh L. Tran, Blank Check Acquisitions (SSRN
Working Paper, 2010);James S. Murray, The Regulation and Pricing of Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation
IPOs (SSRN Working Paper, 2014); James S. Murray, Innovation, Imitation and Regulation in Finance: The
Evolution of Special Purpose Acquisition Corporations, 6 REV. INTEGRATIVE BUS. & ECON. 1 (2017).
184
Figure 2. Warrants offered in SPAC IPO Units, 1990 – 2021a
a The estimated distribution is based on the warrant offering information presented in either the IPO prospectus or
the Form S-1 or Form F-1 registration filed in connection with all SPACs identified by Dealogic, SPAC Insider,
Audit Analytics, and staff manual review, that conducted an initial public offering with a confirmed pricing date as
of December 30,2021.
As SPAC offerings have evolved, however, the highly dilutive aspects of the warrant
component of a SPAC offering unit appear to have somewhat attenuated. As indicated in Figure
2, many SPACs offer units with smaller warrant components. The majority of SPACs that have
conducted an IPO in the past three years offered units with fractional warrants or units where
warrants represented only fractional shares. The dilutive capacity of these warrants is further
tempered by the fact that in current practice, warrants (or fractions thereof) are only offered at
exercise prices higher than the SPAC IPO offering price. However, the reduced dilution
attributable to warrants as a component of SPAC IPO units does not imply that current SPAC
IPOs offer a security that is inherently less exposed to potential dilution or that warrants
purchased separately from units, such as in sponsor compensation or PIPE financing
transactions, are not still a significant source of dilution. Furthermore, while warrant features
have in some respects become less dilutive, maximum allowable redemptions have generally
increased, creating the possibility for non-redeeming shareholders to experience greater dilution

albeit from a different source. The emergent size and significance of PIPE financing in de-SPAC
transactions410 has presented yet another potential source of dilution.
e. Time to Complete a De-SPAC Transaction
Because SPACs are not blank check companies issuing penny stock, they have not been
subject to Rule 419’s requirements, including the requirement that an acquisition occur by a date
18 months after the effective date of the blank check company’s initial registration statement.
411
Nevertheless, SPACs use, as a matter of practice, features of Rule 419 that would appear to
enhance protections for investors, including a pre-specified intended lifespan before dissolution
that is communicated to investors at the time of the initial public offering. Table 2 documents
the average proposed lifespans (in months) that SPACs in each period disclosed in their initial
public offering registration materials as well as the average actual number of months used by
those SPACs that successfully completed a de-SPAC transaction, by cohort. We note that since
2006, the typical SPAC generally pre-commits to a lifespan at least two months, on average,
longer than the 18-month limit in Rule 419 and approximately 13 months shorter than the
exchange listing 36-month limit.
412
 410 See infra Section IX.B.2.c.
411 See supra note 12. See also Rule 419(e)(2)(iv) under the Securities Act (“If a consummated acquisition(s)
meeting the requirements [of Rule 419] has not occurred by a date 18 months after the effective date of the initial
registration statement, funds held in the escrow or trust account shall be returned [to investors.]”).

a Averages reported here are estimated over the subsample of SPAC IPOs (see supra Table 1 note a) after offerings withdrawn
after the IPO pricing date have been removed. Proposed acquisition periods and proposed extension data is drawn from
information as provided by the SPAC in its initial registration materials including prospectuses and Form S-1 or Form F-1.
SPACs that disclose they would hold a shareholder vote to approve an extension period but did not pre-commit to specified
extension period are treated as having such data missing for purposes of computing averages.
b Data on realized average acquisition period for IPO cohorts 2016-2020 and 2021 reflect a downward bias due to the
outstanding proportion of SPACs that conducted an IPO between 2019 and 2021 that have not yet completed their proposed
acquisition period or approved extensions. See infra note 457.
2. De-SPAC Transactions
The primary parties affected by the proposed disclosure requirements at the de-SPAC
transaction stage include SPACs, sponsors of SPACs, investors, potential PIPE investors, and
target private operating companies. Additionally, the proposed rules to amend or otherwise
clarify the existing liability framework would affect SPACs, target companies, investors in
SPACs, and the underwriters that SPACs use at the SPAC IPO and the de-SPAC stages.
413
We are mindful that parties may be differentially affected for a number of reasons. For
example, to the extent that regulatory changes we are proposing, if adopted, would become
effective while some current SPACs are in the process of completing a de-SPAC transaction,
 413 See, e.g., Luisa Beltran, SPACs Are Scrambling to Find Mergers. What That Means for Investors, BARRONS,
Feb. 24, 2022.
187
these SPACs may incur greater unanticipated transaction costs to comply with the full set of new
requirements. Other SPACs that have not yet found a target may find themselves ex-post to have
inefficiently entered the market as compared to a SPAC that completes an IPO with knowledge
of the costs associated with the proposed amendments. However, the fact that some of the
proposed amendments may reduce costs or simply codify existing best practices may offset some
of the potentially more costly elements of other amendments, thus the differential impact of the
proposed amendments affecting parties at the de-SPAC transaction stage is expected to vary.
Based on staff analysis of SPACs that registered a distribution of securities between 1990
and 2021, it appears that approximately half of all SPACs following their initial public offerings
have announced a subsequent de-SPAC transaction, and about one third have completed their deSPAC transaction. It is possible that SPACs currently searching for targets may still identify
targets, complete de-SPAC transactions, and thereby increase the fractions of SPACs with
announcements and completed transactions. However, the overall success rate of approximately
one-third is generally consistent with previous research findings over more limited historical
subsamples,414 suggesting that the number or proportion of SPACs and related parties that would
directly incur the costs, or experience the benefits, of our de-SPAC-related proposals may be
smaller than the population of parties affected by our proposed amendments pertaining to a
SPAC’s initial registration and public offering.
Of the SPAC initial public offerings in 2020 and 2021, a majority have not yet filed a
Form 8-K announcing that the SPAC has found a target company, or else have not filed a Form
 414 Studies performed in 2016 or later reviewing the 2003–2013 cohort of SPACs find that approximately 51.5% of
SPACs that had an initial public offering during the decade successfully complete a de-SPAC transaction and 21.6%
were still publicly traded three years later in 2016. See, e.g., Milos Vulanovic, SPACs: Post-Merger Survival, 43
MANAGERIAL FIN. 679, 679-699 (2017); Kamal Ghosh Ray & Sangita Ghosh Ray, Can SPACs Ensure M&A
Success?, 16 ADVANCES IN MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS 83, 83-97 (2017).
188
8-K that would follow within 4 days of a completed a de-SPAC transaction. As of December 31,
2021, approximately 77 of 248 SPAC IPOs in 2020 (31%) and an additional 495 of 613 SPAC
IPOs in 2021 (81%) had not yet announced a target or have withdrawn an announced business
combination and resumed searching. Some market participants have opined that, of recently
listed SPACs that have not yet secured a target, a greater proportion are likely to liquidate
without completing an acquisition.
415 This may be due to factors such as changing market
conditions (increased volatility, increasing interest or inflation rates, etc.) and an increasingly
limited number of viable target private companies (particularly companies with valuations in the
range that would match the 80% requirement of most SPACs).

a Estimates reported here are based on the respective subsamples of SPAC IPOs (see supra Table 1 note a)
that reflect all confirmed, completed activity as of December 31, 2021.
a. Filings in Connection with a De-SPAC Transaction
Like any merger or acquisition activity pursued by other public reporting companies, the
timing and types of filings that accompany a de-SPAC transaction are usually a function of the
way the business combination is structured and the form of consideration employed. Such
transactions may require providing existing shareholders information in advance of a vote.
Others may simply require providing shareholders with information and a specified period of
time in which to redeem shares, if desired. Similarly, such transactions may include an offer of
 415 See, e.g., Jemima McEvoy, Take Back The SPAC: More And More Companies Are Canceling High-Profile
Deals To Go Public, FORBES, Dec. 22, 2021.
189
securities as a part of the merger or exchange offer, and if so, may require the filing of a
registration statement. The cumulative effects of our proposals would vary in impact on
individual de-SPAC transactions based on their unique deal structure and the disclosures they
would thus already be obligated or otherwise incentivized to provide.
A recent review of 462 de-SPAC transactions completed in 2020 and 2021 found that
approximately 99% of transactions were accompanied by proxy disclosures and 81.0% involved
a related filing of a registration statement on either Form S-4 or Form F-4.416 Of the 81.0% of
de-SPAC transactions that involved the filing of a registration statement, 85.4% were
accompanied by a proxy statement on Schedule 14A, and the remaining 14.6% were
accompanied by an information statement on Schedule 14C as a result of a consent
solicitation.
417
b. Target Form 10 Information in Connection with De-SPAC
Transactions
If a shell company that has Exchange Act reporting obligations, including a SPAC,
acquires a target that is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, after the business combination, it must file a Form 8-K that includes the same
disclosures about the target company that would have been provided if the target had instead
registered a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act on Form 10.418 This Form
10 information in a Form 8-K must be filed within four business days after the completion of a

416 See Michael Levitt, Valerie Jacob, Sebastian Fain, Pamela Marcogliese, Paul Tiger, & Andrea Basham, 2021

de-SPAC transaction.419 Because we are proposing to require these disclosures to instead be
included filings related to the de-SPAC transaction that occur prior to the consummation of the
proposed business combination, whether in a proxy, information, or registration statement or
Schedule TO, any SPAC that would otherwise file Form 10 information about its target in a
Form 8-K following a de-SPAC transaction would be affected.
Figure 3. Number of Business Days to File Form 8-K After De-SPAC Transactiona
a Data represents the percent of filed Forms 8-K that could be identified, based on staff review, as filed in connection
with a de-SPAC transaction that occurred between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2021, and does not include
de-SPAC transactions unaccompanied by an 8-K filing. Staff noted that de-SPAC transactions unaccompanied by a
Form 8-K containing Form 10 information were otherwise accompanied by a Form 20-F and/or Form 6-K when the
combined company was a foreign private issuer (FPI) and, in the remaining cases where the combined company was
not an FPI, the de-SPAC transaction was accompanied by either a long form (Form 10-12B) or a short form (Form
8-A12B) registration.
As illustrated in Figure 3, staff review of Forms 8-K filed in connection with
approximately 300 de-SPAC transactions completed between January 1, 2006 and December 31,
2021 found that approximately 47% of combined companies filed the Form 8-K on the fourth
business day after the de-SPAC transaction and approximately 88% of combined companies filed
 419 See Shell Company Adopting Release, supra note 211, at 15-17, 21 (adopting amendments requiring the entity
surviving a merger with a shell company to file its report on Form 8-K within four business days after completion of
the merger and limiting the use of Form S-8 to register offerings of securities).

the Form 8-K within the 4-business day time limit. However, as discussed below in Section
C.1.b.8, some registrants currently may voluntarily disclose Form 10 information before filing
the Form 8-K given the staff’s observations regarding incorporation by reference of this
information into the Form 8-K from filings made in connection with the de-SPAC transaction.
c. PIPES in Connection with De-SPAC Transactions
PIPEs have supported de-SPAC transactions since their general increased market
presence began in 2005.420 However, in some recent SPACs, PIPEs have played a larger role
than they have historically played, and this has given rise to concern about the potential dilutive
effects of PIPEs and how well those might be understood by other investors.
According to a recent study analyzing the 47 registered de-SPAC transactions that
occurred between January 2019 and June 2020, approximately 65% of the cash delivered in these
merger transactions was contributed by public investors, and the amount typically contributed by
third-party PIPE investors was approximately 25%, with the remaining funding provided by the
sponsor.421 In such cases, while the equity position of the PIPE investors in the combined
company following a de-SPAC transaction was dilutive, it did not eclipse the ownership stake of
the SPAC IPO shareholders. Because PIPE investors may receive confidential information with
which to make an investment decision (including one-on-one conversations with the target’s
management, which may convey soft information) and may also engage in extended and detailed
due diligence,
422 their participation has at times been considered a benefit to SPAC IPO
 420 See Meghan Leerskov, Shell Mergers and SPACs: A Statistical Overview of Alternative Public Offering
Methods, in THE ISSUER’S GUIDE TO PIPES: NEW MARKETS, DEAL STRUCTURES, AND GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC EQUITY 281 (Steven Dresner ed., 2015).
421 See Klausner, Ohlrogge, & Ruan, supra note 17. The authors analyzed data for the 47 SEC-registered SPACs
that merged, and thereby brought companies public, between Jan. 2019 and June 2020.

192
investors, providing a meaningful indicator of the expected future financial performance of a
proposed de-SPAC transaction.
As the SPAC market has evolved, so too have the role and the structure of PIPEs that
support, and in some cases enable, de-SPAC transactions. In 2021, according to one study,
approximately 95% of de-SPAC transactions included PIPE financings and the average and
median amounts raised in PIPE financings (respectively approximately $300 million and $200
million) were similar to the average size of the SPAC trust account at the time of the IPO.423
This may reflect that in more recent SPACs, in addition to enabling larger deals, some PIPEs
may provide capital to enhance deal certainty.424 In this alternative role, the financing raised via
PIPE investment may ensure that a deal that otherwise may fail due to a high redemption rate can
proceed to completion. In these cases,
425 the ownership stake of the PIPE investors in the
combined company may exceed that of the non-redeeming SPAC investors.426
PIPE investors may, therefore, come to have a larger stake in the combined company than
SPAC IPO investors may have anticipated when making an initial investment. As a result,
SPAC IPO investors may thus find that they hold a smaller stake in the combined company than
 423 See Levitt et al., supra note 416. The difference between average and median PIPEs in this sample reflect that
the data is positively skewed, implying that while some deals may involve low or no additional financing via PIPEs,
other deals feature large investments outside the SPAC IPO process.
424 We note that while there may be more instances in which PIPE financing functions to ensure that the cash
requirements of a de-SPAC transaction are met in recent years, the difference between the average and median
amount of PIPE financing raised (respectively approximately $300 million and $200 million) and the average and
median consideration paid to target shareholders (respectively approximately $2 billion and $1.25 billions) suggests
that many PIPE offerings in connections with a de-SPAC transaction still appear to facilitate larger acquisitions
rather than replace SPAC share redemptions. See Levitt et al., supra note 416.
425 This outcome would also occur if the PIPE investments simply exceeded the size of the SPAC IPO proceeds
without redemptions, but such cases have not been commonly observed.
426 In a review of PIPE finance raised in connection with de-SPAC transactions that occurred between Jan. 2018 and
June 2021, the Commission staff found that while PIPE proceeds ranged, on average from 60% to 88% of SPAC
IPO proceeds, net of redemptions, these proceeds represented up to 137% on average (in calendar year 2019) of
SPAC IPO proceeds at the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction.

they would find optimal. Further, they may not be able to purchase an ownership claim in the
combined company at the same price as a PIPE investor when PIPEs are offered at a discount to
the open market price. Although PIPE discounts may offset differences in the securities’
liquidity, discounts to PIPE investors contribute to the dilution of SPAC investors.
Staff review of PIPEs in connection with de-SPAC transactions that occurred between
January 2018 and June 2021 found the average and median discount to PIPE investors were
respectively 1.8% and 2.4% when estimated over all PIPEs and slightly higher (respectively
4.4% and 2.4%) for PIPE offerings without warrants.427 These results appear generally
consistent with a recent study that was more narrowly scoped to the height of the SPAC boom
that found, between 2019 and June 2020, that the median discount received by PIPE investors
was 5.5% relative to the market value of the publicly traded securities, and, in 37% of SPACs
with PIPE deals, the PIPE was at a 10% discount or more.428 This level of discount appears to be
more broadly consistent with estimated discounts associated with PIPE financing outside the
SPAC context as, by comparison, a recent study indicates that the average discount for PIPE
investors is 11.2%, and for the subsample of PIPES that do not include warrants, the average
discount is 5.7%.429 While PIPE discounts may, on average, be smaller in the context of SPACs
than in other PIPE financing, it is nevertheless a concern that the dilution they may cause may
not be adequately anticipated by SPAC IPO investors.
 427 These estimates are based on staff analysis of data as described in Table 1, note a, and additional data from
PrivateRaise.
428 See Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan, supra note 17.
429 See Jongha Lim, Michael Schwert, & Michael Weisbach, The Economics of PIPEs, 45 J. FIN. INTERMEDIATION

NASDAQ between 2001 and 2015.

d. Use of Projections in Connection with De-SPAC Transactions
Proposed Item 1609 of Regulation S-K would apply to projections used in de-SPAC
transactions. Hence, proposed Item 1609 would potentially affect preparers and users of
financial projections related to de-SPAC transactions, including SPACs, their sponsors, target
companies, their controlling shareholders and management, and current and prospective
investors.
Three recent papers discuss the use of projections by SPACs and target private operating
companies in de-SPAC transactions. Chapman, Frankel, and Martin (2021) collected data on
420 SPACs with IPO dates from 2015 to 2020.430 They found that 249 (59.29%) de-SPAC
transactions were accompanied by at least one forecast. Dambra, Even-Tov, and George (2022)
focus on de-SPAC transactions between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. They restrict
their sample to de-SPAC acquisitions with a single target and exclude SPACs that either delisted
before the merger effective date, that traded on the OTC market, or focused on the biotech
industry, yielding a sample of 142 observations.431 They identify 128 target private companies
(90.1%) that provided at least one form of forecast (e.g., revenue or net income) in investor
presentations. Blankespoor, Hendricks, Miller, and Stockbridge (2022) reviewed a sample of
963 SPAC IPOs completed between January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2021. They removed firms
“that are still seeking a merger target, have liquidated, are foreign, or have not publicly filed their
roadshow”, and arrived at a sample of 389 SPACs. Of this sample, 312 (80.21%) SPACs
provided a revenue forecast. These studies suggest that the use of projections is fairly common
in the de-SPAC transactions and may have become increasingly common over time.

430 See Chapman, Frankel, and Martin, supra note 291.
431 See Dambra, supra note 33.
195
e. Use of Fairness Opinions
According to one source, in 2021, only 15% of de-SPAC transactions disclosed that they
were supported by fairness opinions.432 In contrast, a study of mergers and acquisitions more
broadly found that 85% of bidders obtain fairness opinions.433 The results indicate that deals in
which bidders obtain fairness opinions may be associated with higher stock price reactions to the
deal announcement and also better post-merger operating performance.434 This study suggests
that, for mergers and acquisitions in which a proxy vote is required, a fairness opinion obtained
by the bidder can mitigate information risks and enhance communications between bidder boards
of directors and their shareholders.435
f. SPAC Filer Status
Figure 4 below shows the proportion of SPACs that claimed smaller reporting company
or EGC status, or both, in their first annual report after the initial public offering. Since 2016,
almost all SPACs in their initial public offerings have claimed either smaller reporting company
or EGC status, with the majority claiming both. For example, in 2021, 399 SPACs in their initial
public offerings claimed both smaller reporting company and EGC status, while 48 only claimed
EGC status.
 432 See Levitt, Jacob, Fain, Marcogliese, Tiger, & Basham, supra note 416.
433 This finding is based on deals that occurred between 1995 and 2015, involving a publicly traded bidder that
seeks to acquire a majority of the target’s shares. As discussed by the authors, it is difficult to estimate the fraction
of deals that involve a fairness opinion since the use of fairness opinions is disclosed only if bidders are required to
file proxy statements to solicit a shareholder vote. They note that listing rules of the NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ
require a bidder shareholder vote only when the bidder plans to issue 20% or more new equity to finance a deal. In
other words, if the bidder issues less than 20% equity or uses cash to finance the deal, the bidder would not be
required to disclose the fairness opinion even if the firm had obtained one. See Tingting Liu, The Wealth Effects of
Fairness Opinions in Takeovers, 53 FIN. REV. 533 (2018) (finding positive wealth effects from fairness opinions
after the SEC approved Rule 2290 in Oct. 2007 which regulates the identification and disclosure of conflicts of
interest of investment banks rendering fairness opinions.)

amendment to either that was filed most proximate in time to the date of the initial public offering.
g. Changes in Jurisdiction of the Combined Company
As we consider the potential economic effects of the proposed new rules and
amendments, we take into consideration elements of the both the economic and the regulatory
baseline, which would include accounting for variations between the applicable legal
frameworks in the jurisdictions in which SPACs are incorporated or organized. Table 4 presents
information on the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization for each SPAC that conducted its
initial public offering after 1990 and completed a de-SPAC transaction before 2022. The first
two columns state the percentage of SPACs that were originally incorporated or organized in
each of six listed jurisdictions. The second two columns state—for each originating
jurisdiction—the percentage of combined companies that were incorporated or organized in the
listed jurisdictions following a de-SPAC transaction.

While the majority of SPACs that subsequently consummate a de-SPAC transaction
remain incorporated in the same location, Table 4 indicates that the jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization of the combined company may change in connection with the de-SPAC
transaction. As a result, SPACs may face changes in prevailing legal standards that arise from a
change in jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. To the extent that different jurisdictions
have different disclosure requirements and provide differing levels of investor protections, the
baseline regulatory regime will vary across SPACs and may change upon the de-SPAC
transaction.

offerings withdrawn after the IPO pricing date and SPACs with a missing merger completion date
have been removed. State of incorporation data is obtained from a combination of sources, including
Dealogic, Audit Analytics, and SEC filings available on EDGAR. These estimates reflect all
confirmed, completed activity as of December 31, 2021.
3. Blank Check Companies
We are also proposing an amendment to the definition of “blank check company” for
purposes of the PSLRA safe harbor provisions.436 The proposed amendment would affect
SPACs and certain other blank check companies that may not already be excluded from the
PSLRA safe harbor, as well as investors and other market participants whose access to the
informational content of forward-looking statements, or potential remedies in the case of
material omissions or misstatements, would otherwise differ.437 We estimate that in addition to

436 See supra Section III.D.
437 Although the PSLRA safe harbor may currently affect private litigation against some SPAC and blank check
companies, those companies are subject to state and federal enforcement actions.
199
potentially affected SPACs, as previously discussed,438 approximately 30 non-SPAC entities that
self-identified as blank check companies but did not self-identify as penny stock issuers may also
be affected by the proposed amendment.439 Because such non-SPAC blank check companies
may not be subject to the same limitations on duration as SPACs, the number of filings or
disclosures they might make under the presumed protections of the safe harbor may be greater.
However, due to the nature of a blank check company as a development stage company with no
specific plan or purpose other than to merge with or acquire an unidentified company or
companies, or other entity, or person,440 it is unlikely that the nature of the forward-looking
statements such a registrant might produce would differ in substance from the informational
content provided by SPACs and therefore should not have a differential impact on investors or
other market participants.
4. Shell-Company Business Combinations
Proposed Securities Act Rule 145a and proposed Article 15 of Regulation S-X would
affect SPACs and other shell companies (other than business combination related shell
 438 See supra Sections IX.B.1.a & IX.B.2.
439 This estimate is based on staff review of all registrants, by unique CIK, that filed at least one periodic or current
report between 2019 and 2021 and, as of its most recent filing, identifies its SIC code as 6770. We exclude CIKs
that have already been identified as SPACs and those associated with filings that self-identify as penny stock issuers
under Rule 419. We note that this estimate may represent an upper bound on the number of additional affected
parties because it is based on registrants’ self-reported SIC and penny stock issuer status. Studies have reported that
self-reported SIC codes may contain errors that could cause a higher number of issuers to be counted as affected
parties than in effect would be. See, e.g., Murat Aydogdu, Chander Shekar, & Violet Torbey, Shell Companies as
IPO Alternatives: An Analysis of Trading Activity Around Reverse Mergers, 17 APPLIED FIN. ECON. 1335 (2007)
(“Not all firms that use SIC [code] 6770 are actually blank checks. For instance, companies are required to file
Form 12 after an acquisition to notify the SEC of their new SIC code. Many fail to file as they acquire operations in
a business with a more descriptive SIC code, yet they continue to use 6770.”). Our estimate does not seek to
reclassify potential errors in this case because we are not able to distinguish when the classification error would
represent a mistake made by a registrant that knows it is not a blank check company versus when the registrant is
mistaken in its belief that it is a blank check company when it may not be. In the latter case, even if mistaken about
its blank check company status as a registrant, the party would still be affected by the proposed amendment because
they may currently make, or believe they are able to make, forward looking statements under the PSLRA safe
harbor, and would not if the proposed amendment is adopted.
440 See the definition of “blank check company” in Rule 419(a)(2)(i) of the Securities Act.
200
companies) involved in business combination transactions. Proposed Rule 145a would impact
the disclosures reporting shell company investors may receive and potential sources of liability.
Proposed Article 15 of Regulation S-X would impact the financial statements associated with
business combinations involving shell companies and, thus, would also affect parties that are
typically associated with the preparation, review, and dissemination of financial statements and
the information they contain.
441 Table 5 below illustrates that the proportion of SPAC to nonSPAC reporting shell-company business combinations has shifted due to the increasing number
of SPACs entering the market. It also shows that, in 2021, more than one-third of all targets
acquired by a reporting shell company appear to merge with a non-SPAC entity.
Table 5. Distribution by Year of Shell-Mergers Reported on Form 8-Ka
2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021
SPAC 9.5% 8.8% 17.8% 30.2% 42.2% 65.2%
Non-SPAC 90.5% 91.2% 82.2% 69.8% 57.8% 34.8%
a Based on Form 8-Ks by calendar year of filing that contain Item 5.06 (Change in Shell
Company Status) disclosures, excluding filings by asset-backed securities issuers.
We estimate that in addition to existing SPACs that have yet to complete a de-SPAC
transaction, approximately 160 additional existing reporting shell companies may be affected by
 441 We acknowledge the possibility of a situation in which a previously non-public shell company files an initial
registrant statement. The financial statements included in the registration statement would be required to comply
with Regulation S-X, including the proposed amendments in Rule 15-01. As we currently lack the data necessary to
estimate the number of shell companies that are private, at present, that could be impacted by proposed Article 15,
they are not included in the estimates discussed in this analysis. However, the extent to which this may impact our
conclusions is limited because, based on staff observation and experience with common transaction structures, we
believe it is unlikely proposed Article 15 will impact many such shell companies.
201
the proposed amendments.442 Almost all of these non-SPAC reporting shell companies trade on
the OTC market443 and tend to be smaller than SPACs in terms of market capitalization and total
assets.444 We further estimate that approximately 11.0% (18) of these shells would also be
affected by the proposed amendment to redefine the term “blank check company” for purposes
of the PSLRA.445
Our estimate of approximately 160 shell companies represents an upper bound on the
number of potentially affected shell companies because some of these shell companies could
engage in transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration, or otherwise may engage in
transactions that would not require registration. For example, if a shell company were to acquire
another shell company, the acquiring shell would not be affected by proposed Rule 145a or
proposed Article 15. Similarly, a shell company that obtains a fairness determination from a
court or authorized governmental entity might also be exempt.446 Given that a more precise
estimate would require us to make assumptions about what proportion of future shell company
mergers may be exempt or not require registration, we request additional data or comments that
would help inform our expectations about how many shell companies that are not SPACs would
also be involved in transactions that would be affected by the proposed rules.

442 This estimate is based on staff review of all registrants’ self-reported status as a shell company on the cover page
of the most recent annual report (Forms 10-K, 20-F, or 40-F) or an amendment thereto filed in calendar year 2021
by unique CIKs of entities that are not already identified as SPACs.
443 Based on staff review of periodic filings, approximately 72.7% of these shells trade OTC, 26.1% do not trade,
and 0.6% each appear to have traded on Nasdaq Global Market and NYSE Market, respectively.
444 As of yearend 2021, the average market capitalization of non-SPACs shell companies was $154,731,262.50
while the average market capitalization of SPACs was $306,204,218.60. Based on the most recent periodic
disclosure filed per registrant before Dec. 31, 2021, the average total asset position of a non-SPAC shell was
$33,666,553.41 while the average of SPAC total assets was $309,570,778.30.
445 This estimate is based on a cross-tabulation, by unique CIK, of potentially affected parties identified as blank
check companies (see supra note 439) and as shell companies (see supra note 442).
446 See Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act; Staff Legal Bulletin No. 3A (CF) (June 18, 2008), available at

5. Projections Under Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K
The proposed amendments to Item 10(b) would update the Commission’s view on factors
to be considered in formulating and disclosing financial projections and would specify the
application of Item 10(b) to financial projections prepared by parties other than management. To
the extent that parties elect to follow the updated guidance set forth in the proposed amendments,
it would affect registrants and other entities providing financial projections in Commission
filings, such as a target firm involved in a business combination with a reporting registrant. A
recent study examined management earnings forecasts by focusing on public companies from
2000 to 2018.447 Drawing management earnings forecast data from IBES Guidance, they find
that management provides earnings forecasts in 15,295 (30.8%) out of 49,595 firm-years. The
proposed amendments to Item 10(b) would also affect investors and other users of the financial
projections included in Commission filings, to the extent that parties elect to follow the updated
guidance.
6. Investment Company Act Safe Harbor
The proposed safe harbor would affect all current and future SPACs, sponsors, investors,
and potential target companies. For statistics on these affected parties in the SPAC market, see

447 See Claude Francoeur, Yuntian Li, Zvi Singer, & Jing Zhang. Earnings Forecasts of Female CEOs: Quality and
Consequences, REV. ACCT. STUD. (2022). IBES is a database that includes quantitative (numeric) company earnings
forecasts collected from press releases and transcripts of corporate events. To the extent that some of the
management earnings forecasts in the IBES database are not included in SEC filings, these figures may overstate the
activity that would be affected. However, because the study sample is drawn from a period after the adoption of
Regulation FD, we believe the likelihood an IBES record would not also be present in an SEC filing is low. It is
more likely that these figures may understate the number of affected projections, because the database does not
include all public reporting companies, and because management may provide financial projections that are not
captured by the IBES database. See, e.g., Zahn Bozanic, Darren T. Roulstone, and Andrew Van Buskirk,
Management earnings forecasts and other forward-looking statements, 65 J. ACCT & ECON., 1 (2018) (indicating
that approximately 33% of Form 8-K filings of earnings announcements include at least one quantitative forecast.)

under the Securities Act, see our discussion above.449
a. Nature and Management of SPAC Assets
Most SPACs hold a majority of their assets in a trust (or escrow) account, which is also
required by current listing standards.450 For example, Table 6 shows that, on average,
approximately 90% of the initial offering proceeds raised in a SPAC IPO in 2021 were deposited
in trust accounts.

b In millions of dollars.
c In millions of dollars, includes exercise of overallotment as reported in Dealogic.
It is also our understanding that SPAC assets, particularly those held in the trust account,
are largely invested in Government securities or Government money market funds.451 We also
understand that SPACs generally disclose in their IPO prospectuses that any income earned on
assets in the trust account will be used toward the de-SPAC transaction, after possible deductions
for tax payments. Some SPACs also disclose that a portion of the interest income could be used
toward any potential dissolution expenses.

448 See supra Sections IX.B.1 and IX.B.2
449 See supra Section VI.A.1.
450 See supra note 392 and accompanying text.
451 See, e.g., Rodrigues & Stegemoller, supra note 17.
204
b. SPAC Activities
Currently, the typical SPAC discloses in its IPO prospectuses that it is formed as a blank
check company for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses.
In addition, SPACs usually provide disclosures in their IPO prospectuses indicating that they
believe they do not meet the investment company definition under Section 3(a). They further
typically disclose to prospective investors that if they are determined to be an investment
company in the future, the costs and logistics of compliance with the Investment Company Act
would be prohibitive.
Current exchange listing standards and SPACs’ own disclosures in their initial public
offering registration statements generally require that SPACs must combine with a target that is
unidentified at the time of their initial public offerings.452 As a result of exchange rules and their
own disclosed commitments to investors, SPACs generally have a limited period to find a target
and negotiate the terms of a de-SPAC transaction agreement.453 Because of the incentives
provided to sponsors by the SPAC structure to complete a de-SPAC transaction, the limited
period provided for a SPAC to search for a target and complete a transaction deal may cause
some SPACs to pursue comparatively less attractive targets as they get closer to their de-SPAC
transaction deadlines.
454 In addition, the limited period to search for a target and complete a de-
 452 See Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2 (listing standards for companies with a business plan to “engage in a merger
or acquisition with one or more unidentified companies”); NYSE American Company Guide Section 119 (similar).
453 This limited period may go beyond the pre-committed lifespan SPACs disclose in their IPO registration
statements. As we discuss in infra Section IX.B.6.c, SPACs currently may pre-commit to hold a vote on a prespecified extension period, if needed, to complete a de-SPAC transaction. SPACs may also ask shareholders ex-post
to vote for an extension of the lifespan of the SPAC, even if they did not pre-commit to such a vote. Based on the
sample of SPACs analyzed in infra Section IX.B.6.c, the vast majority of SPACs conclude a de-SPAC transaction or
liquidate the SPAC within 36 months of their IPO date.
454 There is some evidence consistent with such incentives. See, e.g., Dimitrova, supra note 30 (finding that fouryear post-IPO buy-and-hold abnormal return is on average 8.8% lower if the acquisition is announced at the end of
the (self-imposed) two-year deadline instead of at the estimated earlier optimal time).
205
SPAC transaction may increase the bargaining power of target companies in negotiations with
SPACs compared to other potential buyers that do not face such regulatory or self-imposed time
constraints.
Most SPACs tend to pursue only one target company for a de-SPAC transaction. Of the
483 de-SPAC transactions that occurred over the 1990 – 2021 period involving SEC registered
SPACs, 3.3% (16/483) of transactions had 2 or more targets (14 transactions had 2 targets, 2 had
3 targets).455
c. Duration Statistics: Announcement and Completion of De-SPAC
Transactions
To rely on the proposed safe harbor from Investment Company status, a SPAC would be
required to announce a de-SPAC transaction no later than 18 months after the effective date of
the registration statement for the SPAC’s initial public offering, and complete the transaction no
later than 24 months after the date of the initial public offering. For the sake of comparison to
other current requirements, this is a shorter period than the 36 months a SPAC can remain listed
under current exchange rules as discussed above.456
Below we provide statistics on the timing of announcements and completion of de-SPAC
transactions for a sample of SPACs with effective IPO dates between January 1, 2016 and
December 31 2019. We chose December 31, 2019, as the end date to ensure that at there is at
least a 24-month history available for each SPAC included in the sample in order to reduce
potential reverse survivorship bias in the estimates.457
 455 Based on data from Dealogic M&A module as of Jan. 2022.
456 See supra note 393 and accompanying text.
457 Note that the number of SPAC IPOs increased significantly in the 2020-2021 period. To the extent this increase
has increased competition for target companies, it may affect the time it takes for more recent SPACs to announce or
complete a de-SPAC transaction, or their ability to complete a de-SPAC transaction at all. As of Dec. 31, 2021,
approximately 77 of 248 SPAC IPOs in 2020 (31%) and an additional 495 of 613 SPAC IPOs in 2021 (81%) had
206
We have data on 152 SPAC initial public offerings between January 1, 2016 and
December 31, 2019.458 Among these SPACs, all disclosed in their IPO prospectus that they
would be limited to a 24 month lifespan or less, where almost 59% (89 of 152) disclosed that
they would be limited to a 24 month period, and the rest to a shorter time period, in some cases
as short as 12 months (18, or 12%, of cases). In around 14% of the SPACs (22 of 152), there
was disclosure in their IPO prospectus about a pre-commitment to hold a vote on an optional
extension period ranging from three to 24 months. There were five cases in which the
combination of the initial lifespan and pre-committed extension period exceeded a 24-month
potential total lifespan for the SPAC. However, we recognize that SPACs may, and some
currently do, ask shareholders to vote for an extension of the lifespan of the SPAC even if they
did not pre-commit to such a vote or a specified extension period in the event of a vote.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 96% (146 of 152) of the SPACs in the sample
had announced an agreement to enter into a de-SPAC transaction, and approximately 91% had
completed a de-SPAC transaction. Among the 13 cases (9%) in the sample where SPACs had
not completed a de-SPAC transaction at this time, seven SPACs had been formally liquidated,459
whereas six SPACs were still active (four of which had announced a de-SPAC transaction). As
of December 31, 2021, the lifespan of the six still active SPACs ranged between 25 to 37 months
since the IPO date.
Overall, approximately 59% (89 of 152) of the SPACs in the sample announced an
agreement to enter into a de-SPAC transaction no later than 18-months after the date of the initial
 not yet announced a target or have withdrawn an announced business combination and resumed searching (see supra
Section IX.B.2). See also supra note 413 and accompanying text.

public offering, and 88% (134 of 152) announced a transaction agreement no later than 24
months after the IPO date. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the timing of announcements for
de-SPAC transaction agreements expressed in event-time relative to the IPO effective date for
the 146 sample SPACs that had made such an announcement by December 31, 2021. The
longest time to an announcement was 39 months, and the shortest was four months.
Figure 5: Distribution of De-SPAC Transaction Agreement Announcements (In SPAC IPO
Event Time).
Approximately 65% (99 of 152) of the SPACs in the sample had completed a de-SPAC
transaction no later than 24 months after the IPO date, whereas only 31% (47 of 152) of the
SPACs in the sample had completed a de-SPAC transaction no later than 18 months after the
208
IPO date. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the timing of de-SPAC transactions expressed in
event-time relative to the IPO effective date for the 139 SPACs in the sample that completed deSPAC transactions by December 31, 2021. The longest time to completion was 43 months, and
the shortest was eight months.
Figure 6: Distribution of Completed De-SPAC Transactions (In SPAC IPO Event Time).
Among the 139 SPACs in the sample that completed a de-SPAC transaction by
December 31, 2021, the average and median times between the announcement and the
completion of the transaction were respectively 150 days (approximately 5 months) and 142 days
(approximately 4.7 months). The time between announcement and completion of the merger
was less than 6 months in 78% of the cases, and the shortest time observed in the sample was
209
less than two months (50 days). For the subsample of 99 SPACs that completed the de-SPAC
transactions in no more than 24 months since the IPO date, the average and median times
between the announcement and the completion of the transaction were respectively 142 days
(approximately 4.7 months) and 125 days (approximately 4.1 months). For this subsample,
approximately 79% of the de-SPAC transactions occurred less than 6 months after the
announcement, and there were 12 cases in which the announcement of the transaction agreement
was made more than 18 months after the IPO date.
C. Benefits and Costs of the Proposed Rules
1. Disclosure-Related Proposals
a. SPAC Initial Public Offerings and Other Registered Offerings
1. Definitions (Item 1601)
We are proposing Item 1601 to identify certain parties and transactions to which the
requirements of the subpart, as well as other parts of this proposal, would apply. Defining the
terms “special purpose acquisition company,” “de-SPAC transaction,” “SPAC sponsor,” and
“target company” as proposed would establish the scope of the issuers and transactions subject to
the requirements of Subpart 1600, and thereby provide both registrants and investors with notice
of the associated obligations. The definitions may impose costs if the new definitions are not
consistent with current understanding and consequently cause confusion for registrants, investors
and market participants. Both the costs and benefits would be small to the extent that the new
definitions are consistent with widely accepted views.
2. Prospectus Cover Page and Prospectus Summary Disclosures
(Item 1602)
Proposed Item 1602 would require a prospectus filed in connection with a SPAC’s initial
public offering to disclose information on certain features unique to SPAC offerings and the
210
potential associated risks, in addition to the information currently required by Item 501 and Item
503 of Regulation S-K, on the prospectus cover page and in the prospectus summary,
respectively, as discussed above.460 The proposed additional disclosures may reduce SPAC
investors’ information processing costs and improve their investment decisions. Investors in
SPACs vary in financial sophistication and ability to process the information provided in SPAC
IPO prospectuses. We expect that the potential benefits may especially accrue to investors that
are less financially sophisticated.
Specifically, because investors are likely to allocate their attention selectively,461
requiring disclosure regarding important features and associated risks of SPAC investments on
the prospectus cover page (including cross-references to the locations of the more detailed
related disclosures) and prospectus summary may increase the likelihood that investors pay
attention to the information by making it more salient.462 In addition, the proposed additional
disclosures in the prospectus summary may further reduce information processing costs,
particularly for less financially sophisticated investors, by providing information in plain English
about important SPAC features in a concise format.463
 460 See supra Section II.E for more information about current disclosure requirements.
461 See, e.g., George Loewenstein, Cass R. Sunstein, & Russell Golman, Disclosure: Psychology Changes
Everything, 6 ANN.REV. ECON. 391 (2014).
462 Salience detection is a key feature of human cognition allowing individuals to focus their limited mental
resources on a subset of the available information and can cause them to over-weight this information in their
decision making processes. See, e.g., DANIEL KAHNEMAN, THINKING, FAST AND SLOW (2013); SUSAN FISKE &
SHELLEY E. TAYLOR, SOCIAL COGNITION: FROM BRAINS TO CULTURE (3d ed. 2017). Moreover, for financial
disclosures, research suggests that increasing signal salience is particularly helpful in reducing limited attention of
individuals with lower education levels and financial literacy. See, e.g., Victor Stango & Jonathan Zinman, Limited
and Varying Consumer Attention: Evidence from Shocks to the Salience of Bank Overdraft Fees, 27 REV. OF FIN.
STUD. 990 (2014).
463 Existing research notes that individuals bear costs in absorbing information and that the ability of individuals to
process information is not unbounded. See RICHARD NISBETT & LEE ROSS, HUMAN INFERENCE: STRATEGIES AND
SHORTCOMINGS OF SOCIAL JUDGMENT (1980); David Hirshleifer & Siew Hong Teoh, Limited Attention, Information
Disclosure, and FinancialReporting, 36 J. ACCT. & ECON. 337 (2003). Thus, summary disclosure may provide
benefits by focusing investors’ attention and reducing information processing costs.
211
Proposed Item 1602(b)(6) would require tabular disclosure in the prospectus summary
regarding the nature and amount of the compensation received or to be received by the SPAC
sponsor, its affiliates and promoters, and the extent to which this compensation may result in a
material dilution of the purchasers’ equity interests. There is empirical evidence that visualization
improves individual perception of information.464 For example, one experimental study shows
that tabular reports can lead to better decision making.465 Because sponsors’ compensation may
be a material cost to SPAC investors, the tabular format of these required disclosures may help
investors (especially those that are less financially sophisticated) more easily process the financial
implications of compensation of the SPAC sponsor, its affiliates and promoters, thereby potentially
incrementally improving their investment decisions.466
Additionally, the proposed rules and amendments would standardize this disclosure across
all registration statements filed for SPAC initial public offerings, which may make it easier and
less costly for investors to compare terms across offerings and thereby promote better investment
decisions.
Finally, to the extent the proposed additional disclosures on the cover page and in the
prospectus summary would increase investors’ awareness of sponsors’ incentives and potential
conflicts of interest, it may have an incremental disciplining effect on sponsors’ behavior. For
example, to the extent sponsors would face potentially greater scrutiny by more attentive
 464 See JOHN HATTIE, VISIBLE LEARNING: A SYNTHESIS OF OVER 800 META-ANALYSES RELATING TO
ACHIEVEMENT (2008).
465 See Izak Benbasat & Albert Dexter, An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Color and Graphical Information
Presentation Under Varying Time Constraints, 10-1 MIS Q. 59 (1986).
466 See infra Section IX.C.1.a.4 for the discussion of proposed Item 1602(a)(4), which would require that the
prospectus cover page include a simplified dilution table depicting the estimated remaining pro forma net tangible
book value per share that would be realized at quartile intervals up to the maximum redemption threshold.
212
investors, they may take some additional care in finding and negotiating terms with target
companies, or take steps to mitigate the extent of any disclosed conflict of interests.
The proposed additional disclosures that would be required to be included on the
prospectus cover page and in the prospectus summary may increase compliance costs for SPACs
to the extent that they would need to provide additional information in their IPO prospectuses
than they currently provide. We believe that SPACs should have this information readily
available and in some cases may already be disclosing it, such as the time frame for the SPAC to
consummate a de-SPAC transaction. Thus, we expect that any compliance costs resulting from
these proposed items would not be significant.
There could also be some potential costs for investors. In particular, there is a risk that,
by requiring more items to be added to the cover page and the prospectus summary, the salience
of the current required disclosures may be reduced because they will have to compete with the
new required disclosures for investors’ attention compared to the baseline. In addition, because
Item 501(b) of Regulation S-K limits the information on the outside cover page to one page,
there is a risk that the amount of information required to be included could generally impair the
readability of the cover page. As a result, some investors may pay less attention to the cover
page as a whole.
3. Sponsors and Conflicts of Interest (Item 1603)
Proposed Item 1603(a) would require disclosure of certain information regarding a
SPAC’s sponsor, its affiliates and any promoters, both at the SPAC initial public offering stage
and at the de-SPAC transaction stage. To the extent that such disclosures are not already
provided or are partially provided, this proposed disclosure requirement would provide investors
with information related to the experience and incentives (due to characteristics of the
213
compensation structure, for example) of the sponsor.467 Investors may benefit from such
disclosure, as it could allow them to better evaluate the circumstances that may impact their
investment decision in a specific SPAC. The proposed disclosure is likely to be beneficial to
investors who may consider investing in a SPAC at a point in time that precedes the existence
and disclosure of information about an acquisition target, or to investors seeking to evaluate a
proposed de-SPAC transaction.468
Proposed Item 1603(b) would require disclosure of conflicts of interest at both the SPAC
initial public offering stage and at the de-SPAC transaction stage. This disclosure would also be
required in any Schedules TO filed in connection with a redemption. We believe that this
proposed disclosure requirement would benefit investors by enabling them to better assess any
actual or potential material conflicts of interest held by sponsors, its affiliates, officers and
directors of the SPAC, and/or promoters. Such disclosure could allow investors to more
accurately assess the potential risk associated with the conflicts of interest in a SPAC and thus
make better investment decisions.
Further, disclosure under proposed Item 1603(c) would provide investors information
about the fiduciary duties that a SPAC’s officers and directors owe to other companies. We
expect that this disclosure would allow the SPAC’s shareholders and prospective investors to
assess the extent to which the officers and directors may face outside obligations, including the
possibility that they might be compelled to act in the interest of another company that compete
with the SPAC. In addition, to the extent that a SPAC’s officers and directors owe fiduciary
duties to other companies, these obligations may limit the attention that they are able to provide
 467 See supra Section II.B for more information about current disclosure requirements.
468 Academic literature provides some evidence that characteristics of the SPAC sponsor, such as experience or
network may be indicative of its ability to select and execute quality transactions. See, e.g., Lin, supra note 30.
214
to the SPAC. We expect that these disclosures would benefit investors by allowing them to
better assess the actions of the officers and directors in managing the SPACs activities, including
a proposed de-SPAC transaction.
Proposed Item 1603(a) may increase compliance costs for SPACs, mainly in the form of
collecting, preparing, and filing the required information for disclosure on sponsors, their
affiliates and any promoters. We do not expect, however, such costs to be substantial because
most of this information should be readily available, and some of it is currently being provided
by SPACs.
With respect to the conflicts of interest disclosures required by Item 1603(b), SPACs
could bear direct costs associated with: (i) reviewing and preparing disclosures describing any
such conflicts of interest; (ii) developing and maintaining methods for tracking any such
conflicts of interest; and (iii) seeking legal or other advice. While the direct costs associated
with Item 1603(b) disclosure requirements would depend on the extent to which a SPAC already
provides this disclosure under current practices, we expect these costs to generally be low. As a
baseline matter, the common practice of a SPAC disclosing the presence of actual or potential
conflicts of interest as a material risk factor predates SPACs listing on national exchanges.469
Therefore, it would appear that most SPACs are generally aware of these actual or potential
conflicts and would therefore only bear costs insofar as our proposed requirements would
involve providing greater detail or specificity in the disclosures of conflicts of interest.
Similarly, we do not expect the disclosures of a SPAC officer or director’s fiduciary
duties to other companies, as would be required by proposed Item 1603(c) to be very costly to
prepare. Given the significance of a fiduciary relationship, it is unlikely that a director or officer
 469 For examples of such disclosures, see Jog & Sun, supra note 386.
215
– and, by extension, the SPAC – would not already know what relationships would require
disclosure. The incremental costs to produce, track, or review records also should be low
because signed, written documents typically accompany the entrance into a relationship that
engenders a fiduciary duty.
4. Dilution (Items 1602(a)(4) and 1602(c))
As discussed above,470 SPAC shares may experience dilution from various transactions
by a number of parties or combinations of parties at various stages of a SPAC’s lifecycle. For
example, sponsors typically obtain their “promote” at a nominal value (e.g., $25,000) with most
of their compensation typically contingent on the completion of a de-SPAC transaction. When
sponsors receive compensation at the de-SPAC transaction stage, their compensation comes out
of the stakes of SPAC investors who do not redeem their shares, leading to an interactive effect
between redemptions and the promote that magnifies the dilution. PIPE investments, due to their
typical discount to the IPO offering price and potential interactive effects with redemptions, can
further dilute non-redeeming SPAC investors. Finally, investors that redeem their shares
typically get to keep their warrants. Future exercises of these warrants further dilutes nonredeeming SPAC shareholders’ equity. Because most of these potentially dilutive transactions
may occur after the SPAC’s initial public offering and both the direct and indirect dilutive effects
can be unique to the specific SPAC’s structure, they may be difficult for prospective investors
and other interested market participants to identify, anticipate, or adequately assess. In the
absence of a more complete appreciation of these dilutive effects, the decision to invest, vote, or
redeem, or the price at which one might be willing to enter or exit a position, may lack relevant
information and, as a consequence, be suboptimal. SPAC investors who remain investors in the
 470 See supra Section II.D for more information about existing disclosure requirements under Item 506 of Reg S-K.
216
combined company absorb the above-mentioned dilution effects. To the extent that investors
may not understand the extent of the dilution, or may exhibit inertia regarding the decision to
redeem, the dilution may not be reflected in market prices at the time of the target acquisition.
471
Proposed Item 1602(c) would require that registration statements filed by SPACs, other
than for de-SPAC transactions, describe all material potential sources of future dilution
following the SPAC’s initial public offering and include tabular disclosure of the amount of
potential future dilution from the public offering price that will be absorbed by non-redeeming
SPAC shareholders, to the extent known and quantifiable. The proposed rule would benefit
investors by providing them with more detailed information on the potential impact of dilution
on the value of their SPAC shares, thus enabling them to better understand the effects of dilution
on their investments and ultimately make better investment decisions.
We are further proposing to require that registration statements on Form S-1 or Form F-1
filed by SPACs, including for an initial public offering, include a simplified dilution table
depicting the estimated remaining pro forma net tangible book value per share that would be
realized at quartile intervals up to the maximum redemption threshold. Given the empirical
evidence that visualization improves individual perception of information and that dilution that
may occur due to redemption may be a significant cost to investors,472 we expect that the tabular
format of this disclosure will help investors (especially those that are less financially
sophisticated) more easily process the financial implications of dilution and potentially improve
their investment decisions. Moreover, the tabular presentation may provide investors with this
information in a format that might more accurately represent the dilution that they might
 471 See Gahng, Ritter, & Zhang, supra note 23; Klausner, Ohlrogge, & Ruan, supra note 17.
472 See Hattie, supra note 464, and Benbasat & Dexter, supra note 465.
217
experience if they choose to invest in the SPAC, as compared to current disclosures.473 For
example, Figure 7 shows the average maximum allowable number of shares eligible to be
redeemed prior to the de-SPAC transaction disclosed by SPACs in their registration statements.
As shown, the maximum potential dilution is fairly stable over time, on average about 90% of
net tangible book value per share. Figure 7 also presents the average realized redemptions in deSPAC transactions, which appear to vary considerably over time. Thus, despite the fact that
SPACs are currently disclosing the maximum potential dilution that may occur as a function of
redemptions, this information may not be as useful for investors as a presentation of the same
information in a scenario table at quartile intervals of redemption, given that actual redemptions
in connection with a de-SPAC transaction rarely reach the maximum allowable amount. The
proposed amendments would provide investors with more granular information about potential
dilution, which could allow them to better anticipate the effects of such dilution on future
returns.474 Additionally, the tabular format of the disclosure would standardize the dilution
information, allowing investors to more easily analyze it and compare it across SPACs.
 473 See supra note 74.
474 See Klausner, supra note 71.
218
Figure 7. Dilution Disclosures in IPO Registration Statements vs. Realized Redemptions at
de-SPAC
We expect the incremental costs of these proposed disclosure requirements to be, in most
cases, low. First, registrants should already have the underlying information at their disposal and
are therefore unlikely to incur significant additional costs to procure the necessary data. Second,
while the proposed rules would require registrants to account for potential future sources of
dilution and analyze several levels of redemption, which may require the services or input of
quantitative specialists (analysts, forecasters, or other consultants), the material sources and the
levels of dilution are generally common across SPAC offerings (thus a standard approach based
on best practices may emerge, reducing costs over time) and are known and quantifiable. For
example, sources of dilution may include shareholder redemptions, sponsor compensation,
underwriting fees, outstanding warrants and convertible securities, and PIPE financings. For
proposed Item 1602(a)(4), registrants will be required to analyze only four levels of redemption
(i.e., 25%, 50%, 75%, and maximum redemption). Third, many initial registration statements
filed by SPACs already include disclosures regarding dilution. Thus, the additional burden of
these disclosures becoming a formal requirement may be relatively modest. We therefore expect

that the proposed disclosure requirements should benefit the market broadly and investors in
particular, insofar as the enhanced information on potential sources of dilution improves price
formation.
5. Structured Data Requirement (Item 1610)
Proposed Item 1610 would require all disclosures in proposed Items 1601-1609 of
Regulation S-K to be tagged in Inline XBRL.475 We expect that this requirement would augment
the informational benefits of the proposed new disclosure requirements by making them more
easily retrievable and usable for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis. XBRL
requirements for public operating company financial statement disclosures have been observed
to mitigate information asymmetry by reducing information processing costs, thereby making the
disclosures easier to access and analyze.476 This reduction in information processing cost has
been observed to facilitate the monitoring of companies by external parties, and, as a result, to
influence behavior of companies, including their disclosure choices.477

475 See supra Section II.G.
476 See, e.g., Joung W. Kim, Jee-Hae Lim, & Won Gyun No, The Effect of First Wave Mandatory XBRL Reporting
Across the Financial Information Environment, 26 J. INFO. SYS. 127, 127-53 (2012) (finding evidence that
“mandatory XBRL disclosure decreases information risk and information asymmetry in both general and uncertain
information environments”); Yuyun Huang, Jerry T. Parwada, Yuan George Shan, & Joey Wenling Yang, Insider
Profitability and Public Information: Evidence From the XBRL Mandate (SSRN Working Paper, 2020) (finding that
XBRL levels the playing field between insiders and non-insiders, in line with the hypothesis that “the adoption of
XBRL enhances the processing of financial information by investors and hence reduces information asymmetry”).
477 See, e.g., Jeff Zeyun Chen, Hyun A. Hong, Jeong-Bon Kim, & Ji Woo Ryou, Information processing costs and
corporate tax avoidance: Evidence from the SEC’s XBRL mandate, 40 J. ACCT. & PUB. POLICY 106822 (2021)
(finding XBRL reporting decreases likelihood of firm tax avoidance because “XBRL reporting reduces the cost of
IRS monitoring in terms of information processing, which dampens managerial incentives to engage in tax
avoidance behavior”); Paul A. Griffin, Hyun A. Hong, Jeong-Bon Kim, & Jee-Hae Lim, The SEC’s XBRL Mandate
and Credit Risk: Evidence on a Link between Credit Default Swap Pricing and XBRL Disclosure (2014 Am. Acct.
Assoc. Annual Meeting Aug. 6, 2014) (finding XBRL reporting enables better outside monitoring of firms by
creditors, leading to a reduction in firm default risk); Elizabeth Blankespoor, The Impact of Information Processing
Costs on Firm Disclosure Choice: Evidence from the XBRL Mandate, 57 J. ACCT. RESEARCH 919 (2019) (finding
“firms increase their quantitative footnote disclosures upon implementation of XBRL detailed tagging requirements
designed to reduce information users’ processing costs,” and “both regulatory and non-regulatory market
participants play a role in monitoring firm disclosures,” suggesting “that the processing costs of market participants
can be significant enough to impact firms’ disclosure decisions”).
220
While these observations are specific to operating company financial statement
disclosures and not to disclosures outside the financial statements, such as the proposed
specialized disclosure requirements applicable to SPACs, they indicate that the proposed Inline
XBRL requirements could directly or indirectly (i.e., through information intermediaries, such as
financial media, data aggregators, and academic researchers) provide investors with increased
insight into the proposed specialized SPAC disclosures at specific SPACs, and allow them to
compare it to information provided by other SPACs at the time of their initial public offerings,
perhaps through filtering by criteria, such as offering size or the name of the sponsor.478 Also,
like Inline XBRL financial statements (including footnotes), the proposed SPAC specialized
disclosures would include tagged narrative disclosures in addition to tagged quantitative
disclosures.479 Tagging narrative disclosures can facilitate analytical benefits, such as automatic
comparison/redlining of these disclosures against that provided by other SPACs in their initial
public offerings and the performance of targeted assessments of specific SPAC specialized
disclosures.480
We expect the proposed requirement to tag SPAC specialized disclosures in Inline XBRL
would impose compliance costs on SPACs at an earlier stage of their life cycle than under the
current baseline. Currently, SPACs are required to tag financial statements (including footnotes)
 478 See, e.g., Nina Trentmann, Companies Adjust Earnings for Covid-19 Costs, but Are They Still a One-Time
Expense?, WALL ST. J., Sept. 24, 2020 (citing an XBRL research software provider as a source for the analysis
described in the article); Bloomberg Lists BSE XBRL Data, XBRL.ORG (2018); Rani Hoitash & Udi Hoitash,
Measuring Accounting Reporting Complexity with XBRL, 93 ACCT. REV. 259, 259-287 (2018).
479 For example, proposed Item 1603 would consist largely of narrative disclosure regarding the SPAC sponsor, but
would also include quantitative disclosure regarding the compensation paid (or to be paid) to the SPAC sponsor, its
affiliates, and any promoters for all services rendered in all capacities to the SPAC and its affiliates.
480 To illustrate, using the search term “warrant” to search through the text of all SPAC registration statements for
initial public offerings to determine how many such initial public offerings disclosed the inclusion of warrants
within SPAC sponsor compensation could return many narrative disclosures outside of the discussion (e.g.,
disclosures related to warrants offered to investors as part of the initial public offering).
221
and cover page information in certain registration statements and periodic reports in Inline
XBRL. However, SPACs are not obligated to tag any disclosures until they file their first postIPO periodic report on Form 10-Q, Form 20-F, or Form 40-F. Various preparation solutions
have been developed and used by operating companies to fulfill XBRL requirements, and some
evidence suggests that, for smaller companies, XBRL compliance costs have decreased over
time.481 Generally, registrants without prior experience using such compliance solutions often
incur initial implementation costs associated with Inline XBRL tagging, such as costs associated
with licensing Inline XBRL compliance software and training staff to use the software to tag the
disclosures. Because SPACs typically operate as shell companies with no or nominal operations,
it may be more likely that SPACs outsource their tagging obligations to a third-party service
provider, and thus avoid the aforementioned software licensing and training costs. They would,
however, incur the costs of retaining such third party services.

481 An AICPA survey of 1,032 reporting companies with $75 million or less in market capitalization in 2018 found
an average cost of $5,850 per year, a median cost of $2,500 per year, and a maximum cost of $51,500 per year for
fully outsourced XBRL creation and filing, representing a 45% decline in average cost and a 69% decline in median
cost since 2014. See Michael Cohn, AICPA Sees 45% Drop in XBRL Costs for Small Companies, ACCT. TODAY
(Aug. 15, 2018) (stating that a 2018 NASDAQ survey of 151 listed registrants found an average XBRL compliance
cost of $20,000 per quarter, a median XBRL compliance cost of $7,500 per quarter, and a maximum, XBRL
compliance cost of $350,000 per quarter in XBRL costs per quarter), available at

and Quarterly Reports; Release No. 33-10588 (Dec. 18, 2018) [83 FR 65601 (Dec. 21, 2018)].
482 The benefits of proposed Item 1603 in connection with disclosures regarding sponsors and conflicts of interest in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction on a proxy, information, or registration statement or Schedule TO are
expected to be largely the same as the effects of those disclosures made in connection with a SPAC IPO, though
they may be incrementally higher in so far as the disclosures could also guide voting and redemption decisions at the
de-SPAC transaction stage, which would not occur in connection with a SPAC IPO. See supra Section IX.C.1.a.3.
We would similarly expect the costs of compliance with Item 1603 to be comparable at the de-SPAC transaction
stage as in connection with a SPAC IPO. However, to the extent that Item 1603 would require SPACs to disclose
222
In connection with a de-SPAC transaction, many SPACs currently register an offering of
securities using a Form S-4 or F-4. We expect most de-SPAC transactions to include a
Securities Act registration statement going forward. Proposed Items 1604(a) and 1604(b) would
require any prospectus accompanying a registration statement at the de-SPAC transaction stage
to include certain information unique to the de-SPAC transaction on the cover page and in the
summary, in a style and substance comparable to the additional disclosures that proposed Item
1602 would require at the initial public offering stage.483 In addition, proposed Item 1604(c)
would require disclosure in the prospectus of each material potential source of additional dilution
that non-redeeming shareholders may experience by electing not to redeem their shares in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction, a sensitivity analysis in tabular format that expresses
the amount of potential dilution under a range of reasonably likely redemption levels, and a
description of the model, methods, assumptions, estimates, and parameters necessary to
understand the sensitivity analysis disclosure.
484
We expect the proposed Items 1604(a) and 1604(b) would have similar potential direct
benefits to investors as those we discussed for proposed Item 1602 above.485 That is, we expect
that including the additional disclosures on the de-SPAC transaction prospectus cover page and
in the prospectus summary may increase the likelihood that investors pay attention to and
process this information by making it more salient. Additionally, the proposed additions to the
de-SPAC transaction prospectus summary may reduce information-processing costs of investors,
particularly less financially sophisticated investors, by providing certain SPAC-specific

certain information in connection with their IPOs, the costs of making those same disclosures at the de-SPAC
transaction stage should be lower because the materials necessary would have largely already been prepared.
483 See supra Section II.E for more information about the regulatory baseline.
484 See supra Section II.D for more information about the regulatory baseline.
485 See discussion in supra Section IX.C.1.a.2.
223
disclosures concisely and in plain English. Moreover, like for proposed Item 1602(b)(6),
proposed Item 1604(b)(4) would require tabular disclosure in the prospectus summary regarding
the terms and amount of the compensation received or to be received by the SPAC sponsor and
its affiliates in connection with the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transaction, and
whether that compensation has resulted or may result in a material dilution of the equity interests
of unaffiliated security holders of the SPAC. Presenting this information in tabular format may
further help reduce information-processing costs for some investors.486 Additionally, proposed
Items 1604(a) and 1604(b) would standardize the required information across all registration
statements filed for de-SPAC transactions, making it potentially easier and less costly for
investors to compare terms across transactions. Overall, because of the aforementioned potential
effects on investors’ attention and information processing costs, the proposed additional
disclosures on the prospectus cover page and in prospectus summary may help improve
investors’ investment decisions.
Certain items that proposed Items 1604(a) and 1604(b) would require SPACs to include
on the prospectus cover page and in the summary may potentially benefit investors through
incrementally improved SPAC governance. For example, the inclusion of disclosures regarding
material potential or actual conflicts of interest could increase investors’ attention to such issues.
In turn, this may have an ex ante disciplining effect on sponsors that would mitigate the potential
costs to investors of conflicts of interests. In addition, the SPAC would be required to state
whether it reasonably believes that the de-SPAC transaction is fair or unfair to unaffiliated
security holders, the bases for such belief, and whether the SPAC or SPAC sponsor received any
report, opinion, or appraisal from an outside party regarding the fairness of the de-SPAC
 486 See supra notes 464-465 and accompanying text.
224
transaction. Prominent disclosure of these items may increase investor attention to the fairness
or unfairness of the transaction, which may incentivize sponsors to avoid transactions that could
potentially be viewed as unfair.487
As with proposed Item 1602, the additional items that proposed Items 1604(a) and
1604(b) would require to be included on the de-SPAC transaction prospectus cover page and in
the prospectus summary may increase compliance costs for SPACs to the extent that they would
need to provide additional information compared to what they currently provide. To the extent
that SPACs already disclose some of this information or have most of this information readily
available, these costs would be mitigated.
There could also be some potential costs to investors from proposed Items 1604(a) and
1604(b). In particular, as with proposed Item 1602, there is a risk that, by requiring more items
to be added to the cover page and the summary, the salience of the current required disclosures
may be reduced because they will have to compete with the new required disclosures for
investors’ attention compared to the baseline. In addition, because Item 501(b) of Regulation SK limits the information on the outside cover page to one page, there is a risk that the amount of
information required to be included could generally impair the readability of the cover page. As
a result, some investors may pay less attention to the cover page as a whole.
We expect proposed Item 1604(c) would benefit investors by providing them with
detailed information on the potential impact of dilution on the value of their SPAC shares in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction, thus enabling them to better understand the effects of
dilution on their investments and ultimately make better investment decisions. Besides requiring
 487 Here we are considering the potential incremental benefits of the placement of this information on the cover
page and in the summary. For a discussion of the incremental informational value of these disclosures, see infra
Section IX.C.1.b.3.
225
disclosure of each material potential source of future dilution that non-redeeming shareholders
may experience, proposed Item 1604(c) also would require sensitivity analysis disclosure in
tabular format that expresses the amount of potential dilution under a range of reasonably likely
redemption levels. This sensitivity analysis may provide investors with information that could
more accurately represent the dilution that they might experience if they choose not to redeem
their shares as compared to current disclosures.488 Such more granular information about
potential dilution may allow investors to better anticipate the effects of the dilution on future
returns. In addition, as discussed above,489 we expect that the tabular format of this disclosure
will further help investors (especially those that are less financially sophisticated) more easily
process the financial implications of dilution.
We expect some incremental compliance costs of proposed Item 1604(c) to the extent
registrants are not already providing disclosures similar in nature to what is required by the
proposed amendment. In particular, the proposed rules would require registrants to engage in a
sensitivity analysis to account for potential future sources of dilution and analyze several levels
of redemption, which may require the services or input of quantitative specialists (analysts,
forecasters, or other consultants). However, we expect the compliance costs of providing this
disclosure would be mitigated by several factors. First, registrants should already have the
underlying information at their disposal and are therefore unlikely to incur significant additional
costs to procure the necessary data. Second, material sources and the levels of dilution are
generally common across SPAC offerings (thus a standard approach based on best practices may
emerge, reducing costs over time), and are known and quantifiable. For example, sources of
 488 See supra note 74.
489 See supra notes 464 and 465, and accompanying text.
226
dilution may include shareholder redemptions, sponsor compensation, underwriting fees,
outstanding warrants and convertible securities, and PIPE financings. Third, although proposed
Item 1604(c) does not specify the number of redemption levels to be analyzed, the fact that this
disclosure could be calculated in a manner consistent with the methodologies and assumptions
used in the disclosures provided pursuant to Item 506 elsewhere in the prospectus may reduce
incremental costs. Thus, depending on how significant these mitigating factors are, the
additional burden to registrants of this disclosure may be limited.
2. Background, Material Terms, and Effects of the De-SPAC
Transaction (Item 1605)
Proposed Items 1605(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation S-K would require disclosure of the
background (e.g., description of any contacts, negotiations, or transactions concerning the
transaction), material terms, and effects of the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing
transaction. In addition, proposed Item 1605(d) would require disclosure of any material
interests of a SPAC’s sponsor, officers, and directors in a de-SPAC transaction or any related
financing transaction, including fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and any
interest in, or affiliation with, the target company.490 Such disclosure would benefit investors by
providing them with more detailed information about significant aspects of de-SPAC
transactions, thereby enabling them to make more informed decisions. For example, some of the
proposed disclosures may enable investors to better assess whether the de-SPAC transaction or
any related financing transaction has been structured in a manner that would benefit, for
example, the SPAC’s sponsor to the detriment of unaffiliated security holders of the SPAC.
 490 See supra Section II.F.1 for information about the regulatory baseline.
227
Proposed Item 1605(e) would require disclosure as to whether or not security holders are
entitled to any redemption or appraisal rights, and if so, a summary of the redemption or
appraisal rights. These disclosures would help investors to better assess the impact of any
redemption or appraisal rights on a proposed de-SPAC transaction, including whether the
existence of such rights might lead some investors to redeem their securities after voting in favor
of a de-SPAC transaction.
The proposed disclosures could increase the compliance costs for de-SPAC transactions.
The magnitude of these costs would depend on the amount of information that SPACs and target
companies are already disclosing in connection with de-SPAC transactions. To the extent that
registrants already disclose some of this information or have most of this information readily
available, these costs would be mitigated.
3. Fairness of the De-SPAC Transaction and Reports, Opinions,
Appraisals and Negotiations (Items 1606 and 1607)
Proposed Item 1606(a) would require a statement from a SPAC as to whether it
reasonably believes that the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction are fair or
unfair to the SPAC’s unaffiliated security holders, as well as disclosures regarding whether any
director voted against or abstained from voting on, approval of the de-SPAC transaction or any
related financing transaction. In addition, proposed Item 1606(b) would require a discussion of
the material factors upon which the statement as to the fairness or unfairness of the transaction is
based. Proposed Items 1606(c) through 1606(e) would provide additional information about the
de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction, including whether a majority of
unaffiliated security holders is required to approve the transaction(s), the involvement of any
unaffiliated representative acting on behalf of unaffiliated shareholders, and whether the
transaction(s) were approved by a majority of directors of the SPAC who are not employees of
228
the SPAC. These proposed rules could allow investors to better evaluate potential conflicts of
interest and misaligned incentives in connection with the decision to proceed with a de-SPAC
transaction, which in turn would assist them in assessing the fairness of a particular de-SPAC
transaction and any related financing transaction to unaffiliated security holders.491
As discussed in the baseline, SPACs rarely report the use of a fairness opinion when
evaluations of prospective target are disclosed in de-SPAC-related filings.492 A recent review of
de-SPAC transactions in 2021 reported that approximately 85% did not disclose that a fairness
opinion was obtained in connection with a de-SPAC transaction.493 To the extent that the
proposed required disclosures with respect to the fairness or unfairness of the proposed business
combination would increase the use of fairness opinions, the cost of obtaining such services
would present a new cost to the transaction that would likely be passed along to shareholders.
The average costs for fairness opinions obtained by SPAC acquirers where such information was
presented in an itemized format in SEC filings was approximately $270,000.00.494
Thus, SPACs may incur additional costs associated with proposed Item 1606(a) to the
extent that, in response to this proposed item, SPACs newly seek to obtain fairness opinions. In
addition, there is some potential for indirect costs to SPACs if they respond by providing for
approval by unaffiliated security holders or directors, or retain an unaffiliated representative to
act on behalf of unaffiliated security holders for purposes of negotiating the terms of a de-SPAC
transaction of any related financing transaction. However, some costs to collecting or producing
 491 See supra Sections II.F.2 and II.F.3 for additional information about the regulatory baseline.
492 See supra Section IX.B.2.e.
493 See Levitt, Jacob, Fain, Marcogliese, Tiger, & Basham, supra note 416.
494 As calculated over the observations in the baseline sample (reference first table in de-SPAC baseline (or its
footnotes)) where data is available in the Dealogic M&A module or SDC Platinum database.
229
the newly required disclosures may be mitigated by other components of the regulatory baseline,
which in this case includes the requirements imposed by self-regulatory organizations such a
listing standards and FINRA rules.
495
In particular, if the SPAC obtained its fairness opinion from a FINRA member, some of
the disclosures responsive to proposed Item 1606(a) may already be prepared and provided to the
SPAC because of existing FINRA requirements. Specifically, FINRA Rule 5150 requires its
members (i.e., broker-dealers or underwriters) to provide specified disclosures in a fairness
opinion if it knows, or has reason to know, that the opinion will be provided to shareholders.496
Some of the information that is required to be disclosed includes the following: (1) whether the
FINRA member will receive any additional significant payment or compensation contingent on
the completion of the merger transaction;497 (2) if the FINRA member independently verified
information provided by the company requesting the opinion, a description of the information
that was verified;
498 and (3) whether or not the fairness opinion addresses the fairness of the
compensation to be received by the company’s officers, directors or employees relative to the
compensation to the public shareholders of the company.499
Proposed Item 1607(a) would require disclosure about whether or not the SPAC or its
sponsor has received any report, opinion, or appraisal obtained from an outside party relating to
the consideration or the fairness of the consideration to be offered to security holders or the
fairness of the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transaction to the SPAC, the

providing a fairness opinion in the role of financial advisor.

sponsor or security holders who are not affiliates. Proposed Item 1607(c) would require any
such report, opinion, or appraisal to be filed as an exhibit to the Form S-4, Form F-4, and
Schedule TO for the de-SPAC transaction or included in the Schedule 14A or 14C for the
transaction, as applicable. In addition, under proposed Item 1607(b), investors would receive
information regarding, among other things, the outside party, including its qualifications and
certain material relationships with the SPAC, its sponsors and their affiliates. We expect that
these disclosures would benefit investors by providing relevant information about the fairness of
a de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction. In addition, by providing more
information to investors, these disclosures may lead to improved market participation, liquidity,
and price efficiency. We expect that these disclosures would increase the costs associated with
the de-SPAC transaction. However, those costs should be mitigated because the disclosure
requirement does not require preparation of additional reports, appraisals and opinions, rather, it
requires disclosure of documents that were obtained by management.
4. Proposed Item 1608 of Regulation S-K
We are proposing Item 1608 of Regulation S-K to codify a staff position that a Schedule
TO filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction should contain substantially the same
information about a target private operating company that is required under the proxy rules and
clarify that a SPAC must comply with the procedural requirements of the tender offer rules when
conducting the transaction for which the Schedule TO is filed.
500 For example, proposed Item
1608 would clarify that SPACs that file a Schedule TO for a redemption must comply with the
procedural requirements of Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E, such as the requirement to keep the
redemption period open for at least 20 business days.
 500 See supra Section II.F.4
231
We expect that both the benefits and costs associated with this proposal to present modest
changes from current practice, if any, because, historically, relatively few de-SPAC transactions
have involved the filing of a Schedule TO alone and because, due to the staff position, most of
the proposed disclosures are currently already provided. Between 2000 and 2021, of the
approximately 575 registrants that filed a proxy statement on Schedule 14A, an information
statement on Schedule 14C, a Schedule TO, or a registration statement on Form S-4 or F-4 that
could relate to a de-SPAC transaction, a small portion of those registrants (approximately 7.1%
or 41) filed a Schedule TO.
501 A smaller portion of these Schedule TO filings (approximately
20% or 8) occurred alone (i.e., without the concurrent filing of a proxy statement, information
statement, or registration statement that would provide additional disclosures regarding the deSPAC transaction) (see Figure 8). However, given that the staff has historically expressed the
view that a Schedule TO should include the same information about the target company that
would be required in a Schedule 14A, in view of the requirements of Item 11 of Schedule TO
 501 Staff review of SPACs that conducted an IPO between 2000 and 2021 and subsequently filed any type of
potential de-SPAC transaction related filing (SC TO, SC13E4F, PRE 14A, PRE 14C, DEFA14A, DEFA14C,
DEFM14A, DEFM 14C, DEF 14A, DEF 14C, S-4, or F-4) found that only approximately 7.1% of such SPACS, by
unique CIK, filed a Schedule TO. It appears that the historic use of a Schedule TO in connection with a de-SPAC
transaction corresponds to a period when share redemption was more limited and de-SPAC transactions were more
commonly targeted by hedge funds engaged in ‘greenmailing.’ See, e.g., Lucian Bebchuk, Alon Brav, Wei Jiang,
Thomas Keusch, Dancing with Activists, 137 J. FIN. ECON. 1 (2020) (describing ‘greenmail’ as an event in which a
company targeted by an activist shareholder such as a hedge fund, purchases shares from the activist at a premium to
the market price). In the SPAC context, the activists were most commonly hedge funds that would threaten to
prevent an acquisition by voting against a de-SPAC transaction and redeeming a large enough block of shares to
cross the SPAC’s redemption threshold if the SPAC refused to buy back its shares at a premium. See, e.g.,
Leerskov, supra note 420 (“Many of these funds are arbitrage investors …turning a profit by voting against an
acquisition, therefore recouping their initial investment while holding the associated warrants against any possible
upside from a successful acquisition. Additionally, more investors began threatening to veto potential SPAC
mergers in 2006 and 2007 unless they received deal sweeteners. Mostly, investors asked to be bought out at a
premium in exchange for their votes in favor of a merger.”). This activity decreased, as did the use of a Schedule
TO in connection with a de-SPAC transaction, as SPAC redemption thresholds increased in the early 2000s from
approximately 20% on average to approximately 80% on average. See, e.g., Milan Lakicevic, Yochana
Shachmrove, & Milos Vulanovic, Institutional Changes of Specified Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), 28
N. AM. J. ECON. & FIN. 149 (2014) (20.47% to 84.24% from 2003-2006 to 2009-2012); Rodrigues, supra note 67
(20.0% to 74.4% from 2003-2011); Vulanovic, supra note 414 (20% to 81.52% from 2003-2013). As such, historic
use may be a poor predictor for estimates of future usage.
232
and Item 1011(c) of Regulation M-A and the importance of this information in making a
redemption decision, the proposed rule is unlikely to result in a meaningful difference in the
nature or amount of information provided by registrants.
502
Figure 8. De-SPAC Transactions Involving Schedule TO, 2000-2021
Finally, of the registrants that filed only a Schedule TO, 75% were foreign private issuers
that originally registered an offering of shares via a Form F-1, while the remaining 25% were
registrants incorporated or organized in a foreign jurisdiction that originally registered an
offering of shares using a Form S-1. It is possible that, holding all else constant, any benefits or
costs accruing as the result of proposed Item 1608 would do so to SPACs that are similar to these
entities that may either not hold a shareholder vote or else hold a vote that is not subject to
federal proxy rules. However, it is unclear what proportion of future SPACs would be of this

type, since in the event proposed Rule 145a is also adopted, the number of SPACs may be less
likely to file Schedules TO.
5. Enhanced Projections Disclosure Requirements (Item 1609)
Proposed Item 1609 complements the proposed amendments to Item 10(b) of Regulation
S-K,503 and pertains to projections made in connection with an anticipated de-SPAC
transaction.504 Proposed Item 1609 would require a registrant to disclose who prepared the
projections and the purposes for which the projections were prepared. It would also require a
discussion of all material bases of the disclosed projections and all material assumptions
underlying projections, and any factors that may impact such assumptions. Furthermore, the
proposed rule would require the board or management of the SPAC or target company to
confirm at the date of the filing whether the projections reflect their current view, and if not, the
purpose of disclosing the projections and the reasons for any continued reliance by management
or the board on the projections.
In general, we expect that proposed Item 1609 would allow investors to better evaluate
and use projections in connection with de-SPAC transactions. The required disclosure of
preparers’ identity and purposes for which the projections were prepared would help reveal
potential conflicts of interest and the qualifications of the preparers’ projection ability. The
requirement to discuss material assumptions and underlying rationales would also inform
investors about the verifiability of the projections. The proposed requirement to disclose
whether the projections still reflect the views of management or the board should provide
investors with further insight into the reliability and utility of those projections. Overall, the
 503 See supra Section V.B.1; infra Section IX.C.4.
504 See supra Section III.D & Section VI. For additional information about the regulatory baseline for Item 1609,
see supra Section V.B.2.
234
proposed disclosure under Item 1609 should benefit investors by helping them assess whether
and to what extent they should rely on projections used in a de-SPAC transaction in making
voting, redemption, and investment decisions.505
Proposed Item 1609, by requiring projection providers to identify themselves and related
parties to confirm their reliance on the projections, would likely also increase the preparers’
sense of accountability, and potentially increase their incentives to make reliable projections.506
In turn, investors could benefit from potentially improved projections in their investment
decisions. The enhanced disclosure transparency about projections and the plausible improved
projection accuracy would, in turn, facilitate more efficient allocation of capital.507
We do not expect the direct compliance costs to be substantial since companies should
have the required information (e.g., the party that provides the projections and the assumptions
of growth rates or discount multiples) readily available at their disposal. To the extent that
proposed Item 1609 increases contextual information related to SPAC projections, investors
 505 D. Eric Hirst, Lisa Koonce, & Shankar Venkatram, How Disaggregation Enhances the Credibility of
Management Earnings Forecasts, 45 J. ACCT. RESEARCH 811 (2007)), experimentally show that disaggregated
forecasts, which include forecasts of individual income statement line items, e.g., revenue and costs, are more
credible to investors than aggregated forecasts that provide only the bottom-line earnings forecasts. Furthermore,
Zahn Bozanic, Darren T. Roulston, & Andrew Van Buskirk, Management Earnings Forecasts and Other Forwardlooking Statements, 65 J. ACCT. & ECON. 1 (2018), demonstrate that non-earnings-forecast forward-looking
statements can generate significant responses from both investors and analysts. Their findings indicate that the
forward-looking statements, even statements unrelated to earnings, can provide value-relevant information to the
capital market participants.
506 Auditing literature provides evidence that audit quality increases and misreporting decreases when engaging
partners are required to sign the audit report or when their identities are disclosed. Joseph V. Carcello & Chan Li,
Costs and Benefits of Requiring an Engagement Partner Signature: Recent Experience in the United Kingdom, 88
ACCT. REV. 1511 (2013), document evidence that audit quality and audit fees increase in the first year when
engaging partners are required to sign the audit report in the United Kingdom. Allen D. Blay, Eric S. Gooden, Mark
J. Mellon, & Douglas E. Stevens, Can Social Norm Activation Improve Audit Quality? Evidence from an
Experimental Audit Market, 156 J. BUS. ETHICS 513 (2019), experimentally demonstrate that PCAOB’s requirement
of disclosing engaging partners’ identity can reduce misreporting.
507 See Amy P. Hutton, Gregory S. Miller, & Gregory S. Skinner, The Role of Supplementary Statements with
Management Earnings Forecasts, 41 J. ACCT. RESEARCH 867,867-890 (2003). They find that good news earnings
forecasts are positively associated with investor reaction (i.e., have information content) only when the forecasts are
accompanied by verifiable supplementary forward-looking disclosures.
235
would incur incremental costs in processing the added information.508 Potentially heightened
accountability under proposed Item 1609 may also dampen the willingness of the managements
and boards of SPACs and target companies to provide projections, which may decrease the
amount of forward-looking information made available to investors and thus increases valuation
uncertainty. To the extent that proposed Item 1609 dampens the willingness to provide
projections, it would likely reduce projections without reasonable bases more than those with
reasonable bases. Thus, the incremental costs of proposed Item 1609 would likely be justified by
the incremental benefit of increased investor protection against materially misleading or
speculative projections in connection with de-SPAC transactions.
6. Structured Data Requirement
As with the proposed specialized disclosure requirements applicable to SPACs at the IPO
stage as discussed above, proposed Item 1610 would also require that the proposed disclosures
prepared in compliance with respective sections of Regulation S-K Subpart 1600 applicable to
de-SPAC transactions be tagged in Inline XBRL.509 For the same reasons discussed above, we
expect that the tagging requirement for de-SPAC transaction disclosures would augment the
informational benefits to investors resulting from the proposed new disclosure requirements.510
For example, tagging the disclosure of terms and amounts of the compensation received or to be
received by a SPAC’s sponsor and its affiliates in connection with a de-SPAC transaction, and
the potential dilutive effects related to such compensation, could allow investors to make
 508 See Elizabeth Blankespoor, Ed deHaan, & Iván Marinovic, Disclosure Processing Costs, Investors’ Information
Choice, and Equity Market Outcomes: A review, 70 J. ACCT. & ECON. 1, 1-46 (2020). They suggest that it is costly
to process firms’ disclosures, even for the most sophisticated investors, and they conceptualize processing costs as
awareness cost, acquisition cost, and integration cost.
509 See supra Section II.G.
510 See supra Section IX.C.1.a.5.
236
quantitative and qualitative comparisons to similar disclosure in other de-SPAC transactions or
make it easier to compare these disclosures – including numeric values – to those presented at
the SPAC’s IPO stage.511
Unlike the proposed Inline XBRL tagging requirement for SPAC specialized disclosures
which would apply to registration statements for initial public offerings, the proposed tagging
requirement for de-SPAC transaction disclosures would not impose a tagging obligation on
registrants that were not previously subject to tagging obligations, because SPACs are already
subject to Inline XBRL tagging obligations as of their first periodic report on Form 10-Q, Form
20-F, or Form 40-F.512 As such, the Inline XBRL tagging requirement for de-SPAC transaction
disclosures would be limited to the cost of selecting, applying, and reviewing Inline XBRL tags
to a new set of disclosures, or paying a third party to do so. As previously noted, there is some
indication that these costs have trended downward in the years since the initial adoption of
XBRL requirements for SEC filings.513
7. Minimum Dissemination Period
The proposed minimum dissemination period for prospectuses and proxy and information
statements filed in connection with de-SPAC transactions is designed to ensure that SPAC
shareholders have adequate time to review the information disclosed therein before making
voting, investment and redemption decisions. To the extent that this would provide investors
with more time than they would otherwise have because the SPAC’s jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization does not provide for a minimum dissemination period before a shareholder
meeting or action by consent, or has a minimum dissemination period of fewer than 20 calendar
 511 See proposed Item 1604(a)(3) of Regulation S-K.
512 See supra note 110 and accompanying text.
513 See supra note 481 and accompanying text.
237
days, this may allow them to make more informed choices. Relative to the current baseline, this
proposal is likely to provide its greatest potential benefits to SPAC shareholders in de-SPAC
transactions involving SPACs that do not incorporate by reference any information about the
SPAC or the target, and are not incorporated in Delaware, or do not file a Schedule TO.
514
While Delaware General Corporation Law only requires that due notice of an upcoming meeting
be provided 20 days prior to the event, and does not mandate a minimum period for
dissemination of proxy statements or joint prospectus/proxy statements required by the federal
securities laws,515 we believe, based on staff experience reviewing filings, that the notices of the
meeting mandated by Delaware law are often included in the proxy statement or joint
prospectus/proxy statements, with many companies then delivering the proxy statements or joint
prospectus/proxy statements in time to meet the Delaware notice requirement.516
While we recognize that the additional time we propose to provide to shareholders for
review of de-SPAC transaction related disclosures may in effect shorten the time a SPAC may
otherwise have to pursue a business combination within its limited time before dissolution, the
incremental costs of formalizing a minimum review period should in most cases be low based on
the existing requirements and practices discussed above and market-specific incentives. For
example, as retail ownership of its shares increases, a SPAC may face increasing pressure to
communicate with its investors earlier, more extensively, and with greater frequency to ensure
 514 Because a Schedule TO filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction must already be filed 20 business days in
advance of the close of the redemption period, the proposed 20 calendar day minimum dissemination period would
not have an incremental effect. Similarly, there would be no incremental effect on the dissemination of Forms S-4
or F-4 in connection with a de-SPAC transaction if the registration incorporates any information about the registrant
or its target by reference because a similar 20 business day requirement applies. See supra note 127. Further, in the
event that proposed Rule 145a is adopted, we anticipate the majority of de-SPAC transactions would be
accompanied by an S-4 or F-4 in which incorporation by reference is highly likely to occur.
515 See supra Section II.F.5
516 See supra Section III.B for more information about the regulatory baseline.
238
that a quorum will be present at the shareholder meeting to approve a de-SPAC transaction and
that a sufficiently high number of votes are cast in favor of the transaction.
Notwithstanding this, we acknowledge that any costs associated with this proposal would
likely increase as the dissolution date approaches, because, under such conditions, unique
logistical costs like expedited printing and delivery would accrue. It is plausible that a de-SPAC
transaction would not be able to proceed due to these proposed timing requirements, which could
result in negative consequences (e.g., forgone returns) for sponsors and SPAC shareholders.
Given the significance of a de-SPAC transaction to SPACs and targets, however, we think it is
more likely that SPACs and targets will account for the proposed dissemination period in
establishing a timeline for their business combination. Another potential cost of the minimum
dissemination period is that it could cause SPACs to enter into sub-optimal deals earlier in the
process to avoid the risk of failing to acquire a company later in the window. However, given
the state of current market practices as discussed above, we expect the incremental costs on this
aspect of deal-formation uniquely attributable to the proposed minimum dissemination period are
minimal.
8. Aligning Non-Financial Disclosures in De-SPAC Disclosure
Documents
We are proposing that, if the target company in a de-SPAC transaction is not subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the registration
statement or schedule filed in connection with the de-SPAC must include disclosures relating to
the target company that would be provided in a Form S-1 or F-1 for an initial public offering.
517
Currently, this information is required to be included in a Form 8-K with Form 10 information
 517 See supra Section III A.
239
that must be filed within 4 business days after the completion of a de-SPAC transaction. In
contrast, the proposed disclosure requirements would require that target company information be
provided to shareholders before they make voting, investment, or redemption decisions in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction. This could reduce potential opportunities to engage in
regulatory arbitrage, minimize differences in informational content, timing, and presentation, and
potentially provide investors with more information about the target company when making such
decisions. The benefits of such alignment to unaffiliated investors would depend on the ability
of investors to otherwise procure such information prior to the filing of the Form 8-K with Form
10 information.
We expect that a SPAC or its sponsors would absorb the related costs if the proposed
additional information necessitates earlier or increased information production and
dissemination, although a portion of these costs may accrue to non-redeeming shareholders if
costs are paid from the trust or escrow account of the SPAC. Generally, we expect that such
costs will be low to the extent that SPACs disclose this information about the target company
prior to the completion of the de-SPAC transaction; however, we recognize that some items may
be more costly to disclose earlier than others.
The costs and benefits of these proposed disclosures depend on the baseline level of
information available that is required to be disclosed in the Form 8-K with Form 10 information
that is currently disclosed in advance of the filing of the Form 8-K. To assess the extent to which
registrants may already disclose Form 10 information about the target company in a different
Commission filing before filing the Form 8-K, the staff examined the frequency and scope of
incorporation by reference in such 8-K filings, finding that 95% of the 8-K filers incorporated at
240
least one of the required Form 10 items by reference.
518 Most of the Form 8-K filings that
incorporated items by reference referred to disclosures previously filed in a proxy or information
statement (88% of filers), and 46% of these filings incorporated disclosures from a registration
statement filed in connection with the de-SPAC transaction.519
Figure 9. Incorporation by Reference in Form 8-K by Regulation S-K Disclosure

a Data here represents the frequency of incorporation by reference per item that would be affected by the proposed
amendment as a percent of Forms 8-K filed in connection with a de-SPAC transaction (described in Figure 3 note a)
that incorporated any item by reference.
Figure 9 shows the information that is incorporated by reference in the Forms 8-K filed in
connection with de-SPAC transactions, as identified by the item requirement of Regulation S-K.
Disclosures pursuant to Items 101 (description of business), Item 102 (description of property),
 518 Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and 9.01(c) of Form 8-K each provide that if any required disclosure under these items
has been previously reported, the registrant may, in lieu of including that disclosure in the Form 8-K, identify the
filing in which that disclosure is included.
519 Because some filers incorporate disclosure by reference from more than one source, the total percentage of usage
across sources exceeds 100%.

and Item 103 (legal proceedings) of Regulation S-K are most commonly incorporated by
reference. Less frequently incorporated by reference are disclosures pursuant to Item 304
(changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure), Item
403 (security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management, assuming the completion
of the de-SPAC transaction and any related financing transaction), and Item 701 (recent sales of
unregistered securities) of Regulation S-K.
520 Thus, to the extent that registrants already provide
this information in the proxy statements, information statements, registration statements, and
Schedules TO filed in connection with the de-SPAC transaction, the benefits and costs of
compliance with this proposed rule may be mitigated.
As a result of this proposed rule, investors may obtain disclosure required by Item 403 of
Regulation S-K regarding the target company’s beneficial ownership structure before making a
voting, redemption, or investment decision in connection with the de-SPAC transaction, which
could, in some cases, represent a meaningful change to the informational environment in
advance of the completion of a de-SPAC transaction, particularly when this information may be
critical to an investor’s ability to evaluate potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the
disclosures may allow investors to identify potential misalignments of interests between nonredeeming shareholders and other parties to the de-SPAC transaction. This proposed
requirement therefore may provide increased investor protections and generally improve the
 520 While these items are less frequently incorporated by reference, their absence may not indicate missing
information. For example, filers may not have provided Item 304 or Item 701 disclosures in earlier filings because
there were no changes in and disagreements with accountants or recent sales of unregistered securities to report.
When disclosures are presented in the Form 8-K, Item 304 disclosures are incorporated by reference in
approximately 32% of filings and newly disclosed in 68% of filings. Similarly, for Item 701 disclosures, the
proportions of Forms 8-K that incorporate by reference and include new disclosure, are respectively approximately
35% and 65%.
242
information environment for investors to make a voting, redemption, or investment decision in
connection with the de-SPAC transaction.
Because a SPAC and its intended target should have access to this information in advance
of a de-SPAC transaction, we do not anticipate significant costs to preparing such information
and incorporating it into disclosures disseminated at an earlier stage in the de-SPAC transaction
process.
We believe that the proposed additional information is unlikely to impose significant
changes to the information that a SPAC would otherwise disclose or the costs for incremental
changes relative to current market practice. To the extent that these requirements may lead to the
production and dissemination of information that would not be disclosed until after the
completion of the de-SPAC transaction, the availability of this information in the registration
statement or schedule filed in connection with the de-SPAC transaction may improve investor
decision-making.
9. Re-Determination of Smaller Reporting Company Status
The main benefit from the proposed amendment to re-determine smaller reporting
company status of a post-business combination company following a de-SPAC transaction
would be to reduce regulatory arbitrage by requiring a target company going public through a deSPAC transaction to provide similar information to investors as a comparable company
conducting a traditional initial public offering.
521 For larger target companies, this would require
providing more comprehensive and more detailed disclosure to investors soon after the de-SPAC
transaction. Overall, we expect this amendment to increase investor protection by allowing
investors to assess the combined company more thoroughly and sooner. Large target companies
 521 See infra Section III.C for more information on the regulatory baseline.
243
may also reap the benefit of reduced cost of capital insofar as providing additional historical
periods of financial statement data might further reduce information asymmetries or otherwise
improve price formation.522
The proposed amendment would increase compliance costs compared to the current
baseline for large target companies that, after combining with the SPAC, do not meet the smaller
reporting company definition as of the proposed new re-determination date. Those companies
may need to provide more detailed disclosure to investors soon after the de-SPAC transaction.
We note, however, that some of these companies that meet the definition of emerging growth
company could avail themselves of the accommodations associated with EGC reporting
requirements, which could mitigate some of the disclosure costs required by the proposed
amendment. We do not expect the proposed amendment to impose any costs on post-business
combination companies when, at the time of the de-SPAC transaction, neither the SPAC nor the
target company meet the smaller reporting company definition.
2. Liability-Related Proposals
In addition to the proposals discussed above pertaining to disclosures, we are proposing
to clarify and amend the existing liability framework in an effort to resolve certain ambiguities
and protect investors. In this section, we discuss the potential costs and benefits of the proposed
amendment to Form S-4 and Form F-4 to require that the SPAC and the target company be
treated as co-registrants when these registration statements are filed by the SPAC in connection
with a de-SPAC transaction. In addition, we discuss the proposed amendment to the definition
of “blank check company” for purposes of the PSLRA to remove the “penny stock” condition,
 522 See supra note 368.
244
and proposed Rule 140a that would clarify the underwriter status of SPAC IPO underwriters in
registered de-SPAC transactions.
a. Private Operating Company as Co-Registrant to Form S-4 and
Form F-4
When a de-SPAC transaction is registered on a Form S-4 or F-4, the party that files a
registration statement currently depends on the structure of the merger or acquisition. While the
result of any de-SPAC transaction involving a registered offering would be that the target
company becomes a public reporting company, the liability it and its officers and directors face
for disclosures in the registration statement that inform investors’ decisions regarding the deSPAC transaction is largely a function of how the transaction is structured. For example, when
the de-SPAC transaction is structured such that the SPAC registers the offering of its shares to
target shareholders and the target merges into the SPAC, the SPAC would typically sign the
registration statement as the registrant and the SPAC and certain officers and directors of the
SPAC that sign the registration statement would incur liability for disclosures in the registration
statement. Alternatively, a de-SPAC transaction can be structured so that the target registers the
offering of its shares to SPAC shareholders, such that the target would typically be the registrant,
and the target and certain officers and directors of the target would sign the registration statement
and incur liability for disclosures in the registration statement.
523
We are proposing to amend Form S-4 and Form F-4 to require that the SPAC and the
target company be treated as co-registrants when a registration statement is filed by the SPAC in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction. As a result, both the SPAC and the target, and certain
officers and directors of the SPAC and target, would be required to sign the registration
 523 See supra Section III.C for more information about the regulatory baseline.
245
statement and incur potential liability for statements and omissions therein. Treating the target
as a co-registrant in this situation is intended to provide similar investor protections as if the
target had entered the public market through a traditional IPO (or a de-SPAC transaction
structure in which a Securities Act registration statement is filed by the target, rather than the
SPAC).
The liability associated with being a co-registrant could incentivize the target company’s
directors and management to exercise greater care in the preparation and presentation of material
information about the company, its financial condition, and its future prospects; perform more
robust due diligence with respect to materials it obtains from third-party sources in connection
with the de-SPAC transaction; and more closely monitor disclosures in the registration
statement. Thus, the proposed requirement could improve the reliability of the disclosure
provided to investors about the target company, reduce the instances of misstatements and
omissions, and generally improve investors’ decision making with regard to these transactions.
The proposed co-registrant requirement would increase compliance costs for targets
compared to the baseline in cases where the target would not already have been the registrant at
the time of the de-SPAC transaction. Under the proposed rule, a target and its signing officers
and directors would be liable to investors for the accuracy of the disclosures in such a
registration statement. This increase in potential liability from the current baseline for targets
and their signing officers and directors could impact the decision of a private company to go
public via a de-SPAC transaction. It is possible that, due to some of the ways the proposed rules
would alter differences, actual or perceived, between the disclosure requirements and liabilities
associated with becoming a public reporting company via a traditional IPO versus being acquired
by a SPAC, some targets could reconsider a traditional initial public offering instead. It is also
246
possible that other potential targets may determine that the liability costs (including, but not
limited to, increased litigation risk and the potential need for new insurance coverage or higher
premiums for existing coverage) associated with being a co-registrant would be too high and
elect not to go public. Given the multifaceted benefits of being a public company, however, it is
unclear that the costs of being a co-registrant would be the determining factor that would
discourage a target from going public through a de-SPAC transaction or outweigh other factors
that typically drive the going public decision such as liquidity for company insiders and the
lower cost of capital.
b. PSLRA Safe Harbor
Defining the term “blank check company” for purposes of the PSLRA as proposed,
would make the PSLRA safe harbor unavailable for forward-looking statements made in
connection with an offering by a blank check company that is not issuing “penny stock” as
defined in Exchange Act Rule 3a51-1, including an offering of securities by a SPAC in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction.524 As noted above, many commentators have raised
concerns about the use of forward-looking statements that they believe to be unreasonable in deSPAC transactions.
525 By providing greater clarity regarding the availability of the PSLRA safe
harbor, the proposed amendment should strengthen the incentives for a blank check company
that is not issuing penny stock, including a SPAC, to avoid potentially unreasonable and
potentially misleading forward-looking statements, and to expend more effort or care in the
preparation and review of forward-looking statements.
526 For example, if less time and effort is
required to produce meaningful cautionary statements than to produce careful and robust
 524 See supra Section IX.B.3. See also supra Section III.E for more information about the regulatory baseline.
525 See supra note 33.
526 See supra note 279.
247
forward-looking statements, absent the proposed changes, market participants may have an
incentive to underinvest in the production of reliable forward-looking statements. By increasing
the potential costs to companies of making forward-looking statements, the proposed changes are
expected to increase the incentives for blank check companies that are not issuing penny stock to
exercise more care in making any such statements. Similar investor protection benefits may
apply to registered securities offerings of non-SPAC registrants that would meet the current
definition of a “blank check company” but for the “penny stock” condition.
The net economic effect of this proposed amendment, however, would depend on, among
other things: (1) the extent to which practitioners currently are willing to advise their clients that
the PSLRA safe harbor is available for forward-looking statements made by blank check
companies that are not issuing penny stock that otherwise meet the conditions of the safe harbor;
(2) the extent to which the market does not already discount the informational value of forwardlooking statements; and (3) the costs associated with valuable information that may no longer be
provided due to any perceived increase in the risk of potential litigation.
While amending the definition of “blank check company” in this manner would clarify
that the statutory safe harbor in the PSLRA is not available for forward-looking statements made
in connection with offerings by SPACs or other blank check companies that are not penny stock
issuers, it could impose costs on any such companies that currently attempt to rely upon the safe
harbor to communicate value-relevant information to investors through forward-looking
statements. For such companies, this proposed amendment could increase the perceived risk of
litigation and dissuade them from including such forward-looking information. This information
could be valuable in offerings involving business combinations with private operating companies
given that less historical information regarding private companies is likely otherwise
248
available.
527 In addition, we note that, while there is no prohibition on the use of forwardlooking statements in connection with an initial public offering, the fact that the express terms of
the PSLRA provide that the safe harbor is unavailable for such statements, and the concomitant
heightened litigation risks associated with providing forward-looking statements, may have
created a chilling effect given that, in staff experience, projections are almost never provided to
the public in connection with an IPO. The proposed amendments similarly may lead to fewer
forward-looking statements in connection with offerings by SPACs or other blank check
companies that are not penny stock issuers. This effect would likely be stronger for blank check
companies affected by the proposal that are considering whether to include forward-looking
statements about younger target companies with fewer observable periods of profit historically,
as most of their value typically comes in the form of future growth options. Such blank check
companies that are not penny stock issuers might otherwise be the most likely to use forwardlooking statements to communicate the potential for future value creation to investors at the time
of a business combination.
Additionally, if the proposed amendment reduces the amount of potentially relevant
information presented to investors in connection with a de-SPAC transaction or other business
combination involving a blank check company that is not a penny stock issuer due to perceived
litigation risk, this may negatively affect investors’ ability to accurately value these companies
and allocate their investments accordingly. For blank check companies that are SPACs, such
costs could be mitigated if some of the other amendments that we are concurrently proposing are
 527 See Vijay Jog & Bruce J. McConomy, 30 J. BUS. FIN. & ADVER. 125 (2003) (finding that the voluntary provision
of earnings forecasts in connection with Canadian IPOs (subject to a two-year horizon maximum and accompanied
by a statement of opinion by a public accountant) had incremental value beyond other methods of signaling firm
quality such as the use of a highly reputable underwriter or auditor, including “a favorable and noticeable impact on
the degree of underpricing and the post-issue return performance” and that benefits are most pronounced for “small
firms and those making conservative forecasts.”).
249
adopted and improve the flow of relevant information to investors at the de-SPAC transaction
stage. Similar costs may also be mitigated for investors in non-SPAC blank check companies
not issuing penny stock that would be subject to proposed Rule 145a as reporting shellcompanies.
528 Because reporting shell company shareholders may, under proposed Rule 145a,
receive registration statement disclosures in connection with a reporting shell company’s merger
activity, the proposed rule could result in incremental information about the target company
being provided to reporting shell company shareholders, to the extent that those investors would
not otherwise receive such information.
c. Underwriter Status and Liability in Securities Transactions
Proposed Rule 140a would clarify that a person who has acted as an underwriter in a
SPAC IPO and participates in the distribution by taking steps to facilitate the de-SPAC
transaction, or any related financing transaction, or otherwise participates (directly or indirectly)
in the de-SPAC transaction will be deemed to be engaged in the distribution of the securities of
the surviving public entity in a de-SPAC transaction within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of
the Securities Act. The statutory definition of an “underwriter” under the Securities Act is broad
and does not include an element of intent; as a result, a person could perform functions that
would cause the person to meet the statutory definition of an “underwriter” within the meaning
of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act without appreciating that they are doing so. This may in
turn lead to both deal-specific and market-wide economic inefficiencies such as underinvestment
in diligence or screening. For example, an investment banker, or financial advisor providing
services in connection with a de-SPAC transaction may not adequately fulfill their role as a
 528 See supra Section IX.B.4 and note 445.
250
gatekeeper for disclosures in a de-SPAC transaction registration statement if they are unaware
that they are an underwriter and face potential liability as such.
529
A key benefit from proposed Rule 140a would be the incentives that it would create for
SPAC IPO underwriters that may be subject to Section 11 liability for registered de-SPAC
transactions to perform due diligence to ensure the accuracy of the disclosures in these
transactions. Improved due diligence would enhance investor protection by allowing investors to
better evaluate the target company and, in turn, potentially make better investment decisions.
We expect that clarifying the application of underwriter liability, combined with the disclosures
of proposed Subpart 1600 of Regulation S-K, could significantly improve the ability of SPAC
shareholders to evaluate the target company. This may allow these investors to better price the
securities of the combined company and decrease the likelihood that they overvalue the target
company under consideration. Additionally, more clearly defined Section 11 liability may
enhance shareholders’ ability to pursue a remedy, if needed.
Potential Section 11 liability may deter a SPAC IPO underwriter from participating in the
de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transactions by increasing their costs. The extent
to which proposed Rule 140a would impose new costs on SPAC IPO underwriters would depend
heavily on the extent to which they do not already perform due diligence that would be sufficient
to perfect such a defense in connection with the de-SPAC transaction or a related financing
transaction. If SPAC IPO underwriters decide not to provide services in connection with the deSPAC transaction or a related financing transaction due to proposed Rule 140a, the SPAC may
incur greater monetary and non-monetary costs related to identifying, negotiating with, and
hiring financial advisors. Also, because a significant portion of SPAC IPO underwriting fees
 529 See supra Section III.E.3 for more regulatory baseline information.
251
(typically 3.5% of IPO proceeds) is usually deferred until, and conditioned upon, the completion
of the de-SPAC transaction, SPAC IPO underwriters that decide not to participate in the deSPAC transaction as a result of this proposal may revise their compensation agreements so that
they would be paid only at the time of the SPAC initial public offering. Such a change in the
timing of compensation may increase the up-front transaction costs of the initial public offering
for SPAC investors and sponsors. It is possible, however, that underwriter compensation may
decrease if underwriters would not be expected to provide any services in connection with the
de-SPAC transaction or any related financing transaction.
Alternatively, proposed Rule 140a may cause SPAC IPO underwriters to demand higher
compensation for their participation in the de-SPAC transaction or any related financing
transaction given the potential exposure to Section 11 liability. The fees that SPAC IPO
underwriters currently charge for their efforts in connection with a SPAC initial public offering
generally range between 5% and 5.5% of the initial public offering proceeds, with potentially
additional merger advising fees charged at the de-SPAC transaction stage. It is difficult to
predict whether these fees would increase to incentivize SPAC underwriters to participate in deSPAC transactions or the amount of any such increase. For comparison, the underwriter fees in
the traditional initial public offering process, where underwriters have Section 11 liability, are,
on average, 7% of the IPO proceeds.
530 It is possible, however, that SPAC IPO underwriters
could demand higher fees for potentially bearing Section 11 liability in connection with the deSPAC transaction or any related financing transaction. Any increase in the compensation of
SPAC IPO underwriters would increase the transaction costs to investors and sponsors,
potentially lowering their returns on their investment.
 530 See, e.g., Hsuan-Chi Chen & Jay Ritter, The Seven Percent Solution, 55 J. FIN. 1105 (2000).
252
Finally, to the extent that SPAC IPO underwriters decide not to participate in the deSPAC transaction or any related financing transaction due to potential Section 11 liability,
investors would not have the protection of any due diligence that SPAC IPO underwriters may
have performed in connection with such transactions. However, if SPAC IPO underwriters are
able and willing to absorb some of the costs associated with potential Section 11 liability (e.g.,
because of other benefits, such as revenues from future repeat business with sponsors), the
potential cost increase for SPAC shareholders and sponsors may be small.
3. Shell-Company Related Proposals
a. Proposed Rule 145a
Proposed Rule 145a would deem any business combination of a reporting shell company
(that is not a business combination related shell company) involving an entity that is not a shell
company to involve a sale of securities under the Securities Act to the reporting shell company’s
shareholders. Proposed Rule 145a is intended to address concerns regarding the use of reporting
shell companies generally as a means by which private unregistered companies access the U.S.
capital markets. One reason for these concerns is that reporting shell company shareholders may
not receive the Securities Act protections (including disclosure and liability) they receive in a
traditional IPO because of transaction structure. Under the proposed rule, SPACs and other
reporting shell companies would have to register these deemed sales by filing a Securities Act
registration statement unless there is an applicable exemption.531
Proposed Rule 145a would potentially provide shareholders in a reporting shell company,
engaged in a business combination involving a non-shell company, with more consistent
Securities Act protections, regardless of the structure used for the business combination.
 531 See supra Section IV.A.2 for more information about the regulatory baseline.
253
Currently, if a reporting shell company buys a target by issuing its shares as consideration for the
interests of the target shareholders, and the reporting shell company is the surviving entity,
reporting shell company investors are unlikely to receive a registration statement in connection
with the transaction. In this example, the reporting shell company shareholders would not
receive the protections afforded by the Securities Act, including any enhanced disclosure or
liability that would be available if the transaction were registered under the Securities Act.
Proposed Rule 145a is intended to address potential disparities in the types of disclosure
and liability protections available to reporting shell company shareholders depending on the
transaction structure used in a reporting shell company business combination, and thus, is
expected to bolster investor protection for reporting shell company shareholders. This could be
of particular benefit to shareholders in reporting shell companies that may not otherwise receive
information about the intended target, or potentially even notification that a specific business
combination will be entered into, until after the transaction has occurred. Additionally, receipt of
registration materials may provide a beneficial nudge to reporting shell company shareholders
who might otherwise be vulnerable to inertia by calling attention to the nature in which their
investment would be transformed should they continue to hold their securities.532 However,
these informational benefits to affected reporting shell company shareholders may be mitigated
to the extent that the reporting shell company is able to rely on an exemption from registration
and shareholders do not receive offering materials in connection with the deemed sale. Because
it is unclear the extent to which reporting shell company shareholders may be able to anticipate
which disclosure and liability protections will be available to them at the time of a business
 532 Investor inertia refers to the tendency to avoid trading. See, e.g., Laurent E. Calvert, John Y. Campbell, & Paolo
Sodini, Fight or Flight? Portfolio Rebalancing by Individual Investors, 124 Q. J. ECON. 301 (2009) (“observing little
aggregate rebalancing in the financial portfolio of participants”).
254
combination (as a function of whether an exemption would be available), the extent to which
proposed Rule 145a might improve price or capital formation is also unclear.
As a result of proposed Rule 145a, reporting shell companies, including SPACs, would
be required to register the deemed sale of their securities to their shareholders at the time of
certain business combinations, unless there is an available exemption. Costs would increase to
the extent that a business combination is not already structured in a manner that otherwise would
have been considered a sale to the reporting shell company shareholders under the securities
laws. This would include all costs associated with conducting a registered offering of securities,
such as preparing a Securities Act registration statement, if no exemption is available. The
proposed rule may also introduce opportunity costs in the form of transactions that might
otherwise have occurred, but would be disincentivized under the new requirements. For
example, under current rules, a business combination involving a reporting shell company can be
structured to avoid registration, such as through the use of cash, rather than stock, as
consideration. Because proposed Rule 145a would deem such a transaction to involve a sale to
reporting shell company shareholders that would need to be registered unless there is an
applicable exemption, affected parties may opt not to pursue such a transaction rather than incur
the new transaction costs involved. There may also be financial-exclusion related costs if
reporting shell companies are increasingly incentivized to pursue exemptions from registration
and as a consequence pre-emptively seek to place their securities with only certain types of
investors such as accredited investors or non-accredited sophisticated investors.
To the extent that this proposal would apply the strict liability standard of Section 11 to
transaction-related disclosures to which it would not otherwise apply, we expect there to be extra
costs associated with greater care in preparation and review of any reporting shell company
255
registration statement.
533 Also, there could be some costs associated with timing issues
generated by SEC staff review of any registration statement. Some of these costs may be
mitigated to the extent that the reporting shell company or target is already preparing disclosure
documents, particularly Securities Act registration statements, in connection with a business
combination that would be covered by proposed Rule 145a. For example, in a de-SPAC
transaction, the SPAC and/or target company may already be preparing a Schedule 14A, 14C, or
TO, or a Form S-4 or F-4. Reporting shell companies and SPACs also typically prepare Forms
8-K containing Form 10 disclosures that are filed shortly after the business combination.
b. Financial Statement Requirements in Business Combination
Transactions Involving Shell Companies
Proposed Article 15 of Regulation S-X and related amendments aim to align more closely
the financial statement reporting requirements in business combinations involving a shell
company and a private operating company with those in traditional initial public offerings.
These amendments may reduce the potential for regulatory arbitrage by private companies that
go public through a business combination with a shell company rather than a traditional initial
public offering. Furthermore, the proposed disclosure and audit requirements (e.g., proposed
Rule 15-01(a)) may reduce information asymmetry surrounding shell company business
combinations, including de-SPAC transactions, which may in turn benefit private operating
companies going public by reducing the cost of capital.534 The proposed rules and amendments
 533 See generally supra Section IX.C.2 discussion on costs of increased liability.
534 See Michael Minnis, The Value of Financial Statement Verification in Debt Financing: Evidence from Private
U.S. Firms, 49 J. ACCT. RESEARCH 457, 457-506 (2010). Using a large sample of privately held U.S. firms, the
author found that audited firms enjoy a lower interest rate than unaudited firms, and that lenders place more weight
on audited financial information in setting the interest rate. See also Mathieu Luypaert & Tom Van Caneghem, Can
Auditors Mitigate Information Asymmetry in M&As? An Empirical Analysis of the Method of Payment in Belgian
Transactions, 33 AUDITING 57, 57-91 (2014). This study finds that audits can mitigate information asymmetry
about the target’s value, reducing the need for a contingent payment.
256
that clarify applicable definitions and streamline compliance processes (e.g., Rule 15-01(b), (c),
(d), (e)), are expected to reduce ambiguity and facilitate compliance.
The proposed rules and amendments may allow investors to more readily locate and
process relevant information, reduce processing costs, and increase their confidence in the
reporting provided by entities involved in these business combinations.535 In turn, the proposed
rules and amendments may help investors to more efficiently make voting, redemption, and
investment decisions. In addition, many of the proposed rules and amendments would codify
existing staff guidance or financial reporting practices. Thus, to the extent that registrants are
already preparing statements and reports consistent with the proposed rules and amendments, the
incremental benefits and costs would be limited. Below, we discuss the potential benefits and
costs of each individual item under proposed Rule 15-01 of Regulation S-X and the other
amendments.
536
1. Rule 15-01(a) Audit Requirements of Predecessor
Proposed Rule 15-01(a) would align the level of audit assurance required for the target
private operating company in merger transactions involving a shell company with the audit
requirements for an initial public offering of equity securities. The proposed rule would codify
existing staff guidance that financial statements of the business, i.e., target private operating
company, in a transaction involving a shell company should be audited to the same extent as a
registrant in an initial public offering; that is, an examination of the financial statements by an
independent accountant in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB for the purpose of
expressing an opinion thereon.
 535 See supra note 508.
536 See supra Section IV.B for additional regulatory baseline information.
257
Proposed Rule 15-01(a) should benefit investors by requiring assurance over financial
statements consistent with a traditional IPO.
537 To the extent that audited financial statements
may have more predictive power of future cash flows, the proposed rule also may benefit shell
companies and target private operating companies by lowering their cost of capital.538 The
proposed amendment may, however, increase the compliance costs (e.g., audit costs) of the
business combination. To the extent that target private operating companies are, in practice,
already including financial statements audited under PCAOB standards, the above incremental
benefits and costs likely would be limited.
2. Rule 15-01(b) Number of Years of Financial Statements
Under proposed Rule 15-01(b), a shell company registrant would be permitted to include
in its Form S-4/F-4/proxy or information statement two years of statements of comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the private operating company for
all transactions involving an EGC shell company and a private operating company that would
qualify as an EGC, and this determination would not be dependent on whether the shell company
has filed or was already required to file its annual report or not.
For such transactions, registrants may benefit from reduced cost of producing audited
financial statements because this rule would potentially reduce the number of years of financial
statements required from three years to two years. For those transactions, this proposed rule
would cause some information loss for investors. However, at least two years’ of statements of
 537 See Phillip Lamoreaux, Does PCAOB Inspection Access Improve Audit Quality? An Examination of Foreign
Firms Listed in the United States, 61 J. ACCT. & ECON. 313, 313-337 (2016). The author documented that PCAOBinspected auditors, compared to auditors not subject to PCAOB inspections, provide higher quality audits, which are
reflected by more going concern opinions, more reported material weaknesses, and less earnings management.
538 See Michael Minnis, The Value of Financial Statement Verification in Debt Financing: Evidence from Private
U.S. Firms, 49 J. ACCT. RESEARCH 457, 457-506 (2010) (finding that audited financial statements have more
predictive power for future cash flows, which may explain lower cost of capital as well as greater reliance by
lenders).
258
comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the private operating
company would be provided, the same amount that would be required for an initial public
offering.
3. Rule 15-01(c) Age of Financial Statements of the Predecessor
Proposed Rule 15-01(c) would provide that the age of financial statements for a private
operating company that would be the predecessor to a shell company in a registration statement
or proxy statement would be based on whether the private operating company would qualify as a
smaller reporting company if it were filing its own initial registration statement. Because we
believe that this proposed amendment would be consistent with existing practice, we do not
expect it to have significant economic effects for registrants or investors. This proposed rule also
should help maintain consistency in disclosure requirements across the different routes of goingpublic, which may reduce compliance uncertainty for registrants and their predecessors and
increase investor confidence.
4. Rule 15-01(d) Acquisitions of Businesses by a Shell Company
Registrant or Its Predecessor That Are Not or Will Not Be the
Predecessor
Proposed Rule 15-01(d) would require application of Rules 3-05 or 8-04 (or Rule 3-14 as
it relates to a real estate operation), the Regulation S-X provisions related to financial statements
of an acquired business, to acquisitions of businesses by a shell company registrant, or its
predecessor, that are not or will not be the predecessor to the registrant. Given our understanding
that this proposed amendment codifies current market practices, we believe that the incremental
benefits and costs should be limited.
We also are proposing to amend Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X to require that the
significance of the acquired business be calculated using the private operating company’s
259
financial information as the denominator instead of that of the shell company registrant. The
current use of the shell company registrant, which has nominal activity, for the denominator
results in limited to no sliding scale for business acquisitions, including those made by the
private operating company that will be the predecessor to the shell company because every
acquisition would be significant and thus require financial statements. Therefore, the proposed
amendment may alleviate registrants’ compliance burden to the extent that it would not result in
disclosure related to insignificant acquisitions. Although, the proposed amendment may reduce
the information available to investors about business acquisitions by the private operating
company that will be the predecessor to the shell company, it may also reduce investors’
information processing costs by focusing on financial statements of acquired businesses that are
significant rather than all acquired businesses.
This proposed amendment to Rule 11-01(d) may change the application of Rule 11-
01(b)(3) such that subsequent business acquisitions may be tested against pro forma amounts that
combine the SPAC and the private operating company. This may result in fewer subsequent
acquisitions being significant because the denominator of the significance tests, including the
combined total assets of the private operating company and SPACs, are larger than only the
private company’s total assets. Accordingly, registrants’ compliance burden would likely be
reduced. We also believe any potential costs to investors as a result of decreases in disclosure
may be mitigated by the fact that registrants must otherwise disclose material information about
the acquisition that is necessary to make the required statements not misleading.
Proposed Rule 15-01(d)(2) would require a shell company that omits from a registration
statement or proxy statement the financial statements of a recently acquired business that is not
or will not be its predecessor pursuant to Rule 3-05(b)(4)(i) file those financial statements in an
260
Item 2.01(f) Form 8-K. The proposed amendment would alleviate any ambiguity regarding the
timing in which these financial statements are required to be filed, which would facilitate
compliance for the registrant. This amendment also should help ensure that investors receive
predictable and timely disclosure about the acquired business.
5. Rule 15-01(e) Financial Statements of a Shell Company
Registrant After the Combination with Predecessor
Proposed Rule 15-01(e) would allow a registrant to exclude the pre-acquisition financial
statements of a shell company (including a SPAC) for periods prior to the acquisition once the
following conditions have been met: (1) the financial statements of the shell company have been
filed for all required periods through the acquisition date, and (2) the financial statements of the
registrant include the period in which the acquisition was consummated. The proposed rule
could reduce disclosure that may no longer be relevant or meaningful to investors when the prebusiness combination financial statements of the shell company are included in previous filings
and the historical financial statements of the shell company likely are no longer representative of
the combined company. Thus, this proposed rule should reduce compliance costs related to
filing previous year financial statements of a shell company. Investors may also benefit from the
increased efficiency in processing business combination filings.
6. Other Amendments
We are proposing additional amendments to Regulation S-X, as well as an amendment to
Form 8-K.539 The proposed amendment to Rule 11-01(d) would state that a SPAC is a business
for purposes of the rule, which may cause an issuer that is not a SPAC to be required to file
financial statements of the SPAC in a resale registration statement on Form S-1. This proposed
 539 See supra Section IV.B.6 for additional regulatory baseline information.
261
amendment may facilitate the compliance process for companies engaging in an acquisition with
a SPAC and alleviate their compliance burden. Investors also would likely benefit from having
the financial statements of the SPAC, particularly when they underpin adjustments to pro forma
financial information in a transaction when an operating company is the legal acquirer of a
SPAC. As a result of the proposed amendment, a registrant may incur additional compliance
costs if it is required to provide financial statements of the SPAC in a resale registration
statement. However, any additional costs should be mitigated to the extent that financial
statements of the SPAC were previously prepared, audited, and filed with the Commission.
The proposed revision to Item 2.01(f) of Form 8-K, which would apply to all shell
companies, clarifies that the information provided in the Form 8-K should relate to the “acquired
business” and not the “registrant,” as currently stated in the Form. The proposed amendment is
intended to eliminate any potential misunderstanding as to the entity for which Item 2.01(f)
disclosure is necessary. The increased clarity may reduce registrants’ compliance costs to the
extent there is currently any confusion. In turn, investors may also benefit from the timely
disclosure of information about “acquired businesses” due to registrants’ more consistent
application of Item 2.01(f).
We are also proposing amendments to Rules 3-01, 8-02, and 10-01(a)(1) of Regulation SX to clarify that the requirement of “financial statements” would apply to both the registrant and
its predecessors rather than only to the registrant alone, as the existing rules may unintentionally
imply for the balance sheet in Rules 3-01 and 8-02 and financial statements for Rule 10-01(a)(1).
Because these proposed amendments would codify existing financial reporting practices, they
should not impact registrants’ compliance costs.
262
4. Enhanced Projections Disclosure (Amendments to Item 10(b) of
Regulation S-K)
Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K sets forth the Commission’s views on important factors to
be considered in formulating and disclosing projections in certain filings with the Commission.
The proposed amendments would update this guidance.540 More specifically, the proposed
amendments would state that the guidelines also apply to projections of future economic
performance of persons other than the registrant, such as the target company in a business
combination transaction, that are included in the registrant’s filings. The proposed amendments
to Item 10(b) would also state that projections that are not based on historical financial results or
operational history should be clearly distinguished from projected measures based on historical
financial results or operational history. In addition, the proposed amendments would state that it
generally would be misleading to present projections that are based on historical financial results
or operational history without presenting such historical financial measure or operational history
with equal or greater prominence. Finally, for projections based on a non-GAAP measure, the
proposed amendments to Item 10(b) would state that the presentation should include a clear
definition or explanation of the non-GAAP measure, a description of the most closely related
GAAP measure, and an explanation why the non-GAAP measure was selected instead of a
GAAP measure. To the extent that registrants conform projections included in Commission
filings to some or all of the proposed amendments to the guidance set forth in Item 10(b),
investors would have additional information to evaluate the reasonableness of the projections and
make more informed investment decisions. For example, the proposals related to historical
financial results or operational history could inform investors about potential biases in
 540 See supra Section V.B.1 for additional regulatory baseline information.
263
assumptions underlying different financial projections and help them more efficiently process the
underlying assumptions of the financial projections in making their investment decisions.541
These benefits would be mitigated to the extent that registrants are already providing this
information, or include projections of future economic performance that do not follow some or
all of the proposed amendments.
In addition, to the extent that registrants have not previously applied the Commission’s
guidance in Item 10(b) to third-party projections included in the registrant’s filings, and choose
to do so as a result of the proposed amendments, investors may benefit from improved care and
presentation with respect to any third-party projections in a registrant’s filing. These benefits
would be mitigated to the extent that registrants already follow the Commission’s guidance set
forth in Item 10(b) for third party projections included in their filings, or choose not to do so. To
the extent that registrants follow the guidance in the proposed amendments to Item 10(b), the
incremental compliance costs are likely to be limited. Registrants should already have
information about historical financial results or operational history and GAAP financial
measures, and should be able to easily obtain this information in connection with any included
third-party estimates. Moreover, potential liability for false or misleading projections is likely to
shape disclosure practices with respect to third-party projections in addition to the existing
guidance in Item 10(b).
The proposed amendments to Item 10(b) could discourage registrants from including
projections in their filings, which would provide investors with less information for their
 541 See Anne Beyer, Daniel A. Cohen, Thomas Z. Lys, & Beverly R. Walther, The Financial Reporting Environment:
Review of the Recent Literature, 50 J. ACCT. & ECON. 296, 296-343 (2010) (By employing a sample from 1994 to
2007, this article shows management forecasts providing over half of accounting-based information to the market. In
summary, the management forecast literature suggests that earnings projections and realizations both provide valuerelevant information to the market.).
264
investment decisions. In addition, the proposed additional contextual disclosure, to the extent
included by registrants, could increase investors’ processing cost of any included financial
projections.
5. Investment Company Act Safe Harbor
As discussed above, whether a SPAC meets the definition of investment company under
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act in the period between its IPO and either the
completion of its de-SPAC transaction or its dissolution is a question of facts and
circumstances.542 Currently, SPACs typically provide disclosures indicating that they believe
they do not meet the investment company definition under Section 3(a). They further typically
disclose to prospective investors that if they are determined to be an investment company in the
future, the costs and logistics of compliance with the Investment Company Act would be
prohibitive. We are, however, concerned that SPACs may fail to recognize when their activities
raise the investor protection concerns addressed by the Investment Company Act. To assist
SPACs in focusing on, and appreciating when, they may be subject to investment company
regulation, we are proposing Rule 3a-10, which would provide a safe harbor from the definition
of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act that we
believe would enhance investor protection.543
We have designed the proposed conditions of the safe harbor to align with the structures
and practices that we preliminarily believe would distinguish a SPAC that is likely to raise
investor protection concerns under the Investment Company Act from those that we believe
generally do not.544 Specifically, the proposed rule would promote investor protection by

542 See supra Section VI.A.
543 See supra Section VI.
544 See supra note 295 for a description of investor protection concerns addressed by the Investment Company Act.
265
highlighting to SPACs and their sponsors the potential Investment Company Act concerns that
SPAC activities may raise, such that investors would benefit from a reduced risk that the SPACs
they invest in will engage in activities typically associated with investment companies but
without the investor protections provided by the Investment Company Act. This may, in turn,
reduce the possibility for regulatory arbitrage, which may be used by some SPACs in an attempt
to operate like an investment company without investment company registration.545 A reduction
of the possibility of regulatory arbitrage would also reduce costs related to potential uncertainty
about a SPAC’s legal status and promote confidence in the SPAC market among market
participants. Finally, a reduction in the possibility of regulatory arbitrage would potentially
promote competition among all companies engaging in investment management activities
regulated by the Investment Company Act.
In terms of expected investor protection benefits for investors in SPACs that would rely
on the proposed safe harbor, the safe harbor conditions are designed to ensure that SPACs do not
engage in activities that would make them investment companies. For example, the proposed
conditions on the nature and management of SPAC assets are designed to ensure that a SPAC
relying on the safe harbor would not engage in portfolio management practices resembling those
that management investment companies employ.546
In addition, the proposed conditions for SPAC activities are designed to ensure that
SPACs relying on the safe harbor would have a business purpose aimed at completing a single
de-SPAC transaction, after which the surviving company would be primarily engaged in the

545 The significant compliance costs of investment company registration under the Investment Company Act may
give some SPACs an incentive to try to engage in such regulatory arbitrage.
546 See supra Section VI.B.1.
266
business of the target company or companies and have at least one class of exchange listed
securities.547 As a result, a SPAC relying on the safe harbor would not be engaging in activities
that raise investor protection concerns addressed by the Investment Company Act.
Finally, the proposed duration conditions are designed to ensure that a SPAC relying on
the safe harbor would have a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC
transaction before being required to distribute the SPACs assets in cash to investors.548 The
proposed 18-month condition for the announcement of a de-SPAC agreement and condition that
the de-SPAC transaction close within 24 months would potentially reduce the risk that investors
may come to view a SPAC holding securities for a prolonged period as a fund-like investment,
thereby necessitating the regulatory protections of the Investment Company Act. We recognize
that most SPACs are listed on a national securities exchange and as such are subject to exchange
listing standards requiring that the SPAC completes a de-SPAC transaction within 36-months (or
three years) of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement.549 For such SPACs the
proposed safe harbor duration condition would have reduced benefits since the exchange rules
already provide a limit on the duration of the SPAC, albeit 12 months longer that the proposed
limit.
Beyond providing investor protection benefits, we expect that the proposed safe harbor
could reduce compliance costs for some market participants. Specifically, because registering as
an investment company and complying with the associated Investment Company Act
requirements would be potentially cost-prohibitive for most SPACs, we expect registrants,
sponsors, and investors would all benefit from the additional certainty regarding a SPAC’s status

547 See supra Section VI.B.2.
548 See supra Section VI.B.3.
549 See supra note 393 and accompanying text.
267
to the extent it meets the conditions of the safe harbor. Such benefits would directly accrue for
SPACs that already meet the conditions of the proposed safe harbor, or for future SPACs that
would meet the conditions even in the absence of the proposed safe harbor. Because of the
compliance costs and significant operational changes involved with investment company
registration, we expect that most SPACs that do not presently meet the conditions of the
proposed safe harbor would seek to fall within the safe harbor by making changes to their
operations in order to meet the safe harbor conditions. However, for some SPACs that currently
do not meet such conditions, there may be potentially meaningful costs related to bringing the
operations in line with the new safe harbor (discussed in more detail below).550 We also expect
that most future SPACs that would otherwise under the baseline have run operations not meeting
the safe harbor conditions would take advantage of the legal certainty conferred by the proposed
safe harbor and elect to meet the conditions. In addition, because SPACs that operate within the
boundaries of the safe harbor would be assured that they would not qualify as investment
companies, there may also be an increased propensity for sponsors to launch new SPACs
operating within the safe harbor conditions to the extent that they might not have otherwise
chosen to create a SPAC due to the uncertainty of the Investment Company Act status. Thus, the
reduced uncertainty regarding the legal status of SPACs operating within the proposed safe
harbor could facilitate capital formation. Finally, the proposed safe harbor would also promote
efficiency of a SPAC’s compliance process by providing a clear framework for SPACs to
determine their status under the Act.

550 As discussed in more detail below, such SPACs may alternatively seek to operate outside the safe harbor without
making any operational changes or make other changes to their operations in order to avoid meeting the definition of
an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, including, for example, by
avoiding investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.
268
To the extent the potential benefits to investors of current and future SPACs operating
under the new safe harbor would be significant, we may see an increase in investor demand for
SPACs that could potentially lower the cost of capital for SPACs. In turn, a lower cost of capital
could increase the size and number of SPAC IPO offerings and thereby promote capital
formation.
For current or future SPACs that would meet the safe harbor conditions absent the
proposed rule, we do not expect any direct costs from the proposed safe harbor. By contrast, for
SPACs currently not meeting the proposed safe harbor conditions, or for future SPACs that
would otherwise not meet the safe harbor conditions, there may be costs related to SPACs
changing their operations to meet the conditions or to make other changes to their operations in
order to avoid falling under the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of
the Investment Company Act.
In terms of potential costs of bringing SPAC operations in line with the proposed safe
harbor conditions, we do not expect that the proposed safe harbor conditions with respect to the
nature and management of SPAC assets would impose significant costs on SPACs and their
sponsors and investors, as it is our understanding that most SPACs’ assets are already held as
government securities, government money-market funds, or cash items.551 We also understand
that SPACs generally are not actively managing these assets, most of which are held in an
escrow or trust account.552 To the extent there are some SPACs that are currently holding other
types of assets, they would have to liquidate such assets and move them into an allowable asset
class prior to completion of the de-SPAC transaction to rely on the proposed safe harbor, and

551 See supra Section IX.B.6.a.
552 Id.
269
would thereby incur some transactions costs and possibly also realize some capital losses
depending on how market conditions for such assets have changed.
With respect to the proposed safe harbor conditions for SPAC activities, we do not expect
the condition that SPACs have to seek to complete a single de-SPAC transaction to impose any
significant costs on SPAC operations under the baseline. It is our understanding that almost all
current SPACs seek to complete one single de-SPAC transaction, albeit such a transaction may
involve multiple target companies, which would still be feasible under this proposed safe harbor
condition
We also do not expect the proposed condition that a SPAC wishing to rely on the safe
harbor to be primarily engaged in the business of seeking to complete a de-SPAC transaction
would impose any significant incremental costly constraints on SPAC activities under the
baseline. It is our understanding that most SPACs presently communicate to investors their sole
intent to seek a target company to operate and that they do not intend to act as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.553
Adherence to the proposed duration conditions under the safe harbor is likely to impose
costs on SPACs that would seek to avail themselves of the proposed safe harbor by limiting the
time they have to search for a target company and complete a de-SPAC transaction compared to
the baseline. The option of waiting to invest can be valuable, and to the extent that SPACs
would have to shorten the duration of their search for an appropriate target company and
complete a de- SPAC transaction in order to take advantage of the safe harbor, the proposed
 553 See supra Section IX.B.6.b.
270
duration conditions would potentially reduce the value of this option for SPACs.554
Additionally, to the extent an expected value-increasing de-SPAC transaction would not occur
under the proposed duration conditions, but it could have under the baseline, the proposed rules
may lead to forced liquidation of the SPAC and impose associated costs on both investors and
sponsors (in particular, the loss of their respective portions of the expected value increase).
However, because of the typical compensation structure of SPAC sponsors, they have strong
incentives to complete a de-SPAC transaction rather than liquidating the SPAC and returning the
proceeds in the trust or escrow account to the SPAC’s shareholders. Therefore, SPACs that are
seeking to meet the proposed safe harbor conditions may in some cases compromise on the
quality of the type of targets pursued to speed up their search, or offer to pay more for the target
to complete a de-SPAC transaction sooner, compared to under the baseline.555 In some
circumstances, the duration conditions may give sponsors of SPACs seeking to avail themselves
of the proposed safe harbor increased incentives to complete a de-SPAC transaction even if
liquidation would be the better choice for investors. That is, the duration conditions may
increase the agency costs of the sponsors’ managerial control. However, such agency costs
would be mitigated by other provisions of this proposal, such as the proposed specialized
disclosure and procedural requirements in de-SPAC transactions and the proposed amendments
aligning de-SPAC transactions with traditional initial public offerings.556
 554 The value of the option to wait derives from the fact that whereas the choice to wait is generally reversible, the
choice to invest now rather than later is generally irreversible. See, e.g., Robert McDonald & Daniel Siegel, The
Value of Waiting to Invest, 101 Q. J. ECON. 707, 707-27 (1986).
555 See supra note 454 for some evidence of such behavior under SPAC’s current self-imposed duration limitations. 556 See supra Sections II.F and III.
271
Based on the data presented above for recent SPACs that have at least a 24-month
history,557 approximately 65% completed a de-SPAC transaction no later than 24 months after
the IPO date. Thus, the proposed 24-month condition for completion of a de-SPAC transaction
may be a binding constraint for a significant percentage of SPACs. For the same sample of
SPACs, the condition that a SPAC would need to announce a de-SPAC transaction agreement in
a Form 8-K filing no later than 18 months after the IPO date would have been met by
approximately 59% of the SPACs.558 Therefore, unconditionally, the 18-month announcement
condition is potentially binding for a larger percentage of SPACs than the 24-month de-SPAC
transaction completion condition. The data also show that if a sample SPAC had met the 24-
month transaction completion condition, around 12% of such SPACs (12 of 99 cases) would not
have met the 18-month announcement condition. Conversely, among the sample SPACs
meeting the 18 month announcement condition, only approximately 2.2% of such SPACs (2
cases of 89) would not have met the 24 month condition. Among all sample SPACs, around
57% (87 of 152) would have met both the 18-month and the 24-month deadlines. Thus, we
expect that the combined effect of the two proposed duration conditions would be to force a
significant proportion of SPACs that would seek to take advantage of the safe harbor to conclude
their search for a target sooner than they would have under the baseline or forgo a de-SPAC
transaction, either of which could potentially impose costs on SPACs and their investors and
sponsors, as discussed above.
A SPAC that seeks to rely on the proposed safe harbor would also be required to
distribute its assets in cash to investors as soon as reasonably practicable if it does not meet
 557 See supra Section IX.B.6.c.
558 Id.
272
either the 18 month deadline or the 24 month deadline. Because a SPAC would be required to
hold only liquid assets such as cash items, government securities, or government money market
funds, to rely on the proposed safe harbor, we do not expect SPACs to incur significant
incremental cost from this condition in terms of direct transaction costs. Moreover, a SPAC
already must plan for the distribution of its assets back to the investors if not used in a de-SPAC
transaction. Therefore, this condition should also not impose a new significant burden on a
SPAC.
The proposed duration conditions may lead SPACs to complete less profitable de-SPAC
transactions, or fail to complete a de-SPAC transaction at all. To the extent investors anticipate
this, there may be a reduction in investor demand that leads to fewer SPAC initial public
offerings and/or less capital being raised in these offerings, which could potentially reduce
capital formation depending on the type of investments SPAC investors would shift their funds
to instead. In addition, an increase in SPACs that liquidate without a de-SPAC transaction
and/or a reduction of capital raised through SPACs may ultimately result in fewer publicly traded
operating companies and therefore a reduced investment opportunity set for investors. Such
negative investment opportunity effects may be mitigated to the extent potential SPAC targets
would instead go public through initial public offerings without SPAC involvement.
The proposed duration conditions may also affect the bargaining environment in deSPAC transactions. Knowing that SPACs would face a regulatory imposed deadline for when to
announce an agreement in order to qualify for the safe harbor, target companies may deliberately
prolong negotiations so that they can attempt to extract better terms as the regulatory imposed
deadlines approaches. Such strategic behavior by targets may reduce returns to SPAC investors
further, but may not be an economic loss per se if the transaction is still completed, as the
273
immediate effect in such a case would be a pure wealth transfer from SPAC investors to target
company owners. The potential for an increase in target bargaining power would be mitigated
by the fact that most SPACs’ securities are listed on a national securities exchange and therefore
already subject to the exchanges’ required deadlines (36 months or 3 years) for completion of a
business combination. However, to the extent target company bargaining power would increase
and lead to worse terms in de-SPAC transactions for investors it could potentially reduce ex ante
demand among investors for SPAC investments, which could reduce the number of operating
companies ultimately being traded in public markets, all else being equal. However, such effects
would be mitigated if potential target operating companies instead access public capital markets
in alternative ways.
Any SPAC that would find the proposed safe harbor conditions too costly to comply with
could seek to not rely on the safe harbor and instead choose to bear the legal uncertainty of
operating outside of it. Besides the direct compliance costs associated with being an investment
company, a SPAC that operates as an investment company would also potentially be subject to
delisting, as current exchange rules do not appear to provide for SPACs to operate as an
investment company and maintain their listing.
As an alternative to relying on the proposed safe harbor, it is possible that current or
future SPACs would seek to avoid being considered an investment company under the
Investment Company Act by holding different assets than are commonly held today. However,
holding different assets (such as cash items) may provide a lower return than holding the types of
assets permitted under the safe harbor conditions. Thus, the possibility of switching assets to
274
cash items to avoid being an investment company may not fully mitigate the potential costs
imposed on the SPAC market from the proposed safe harbor conditions.559
D. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
1. Efficiency
The proposed rules and amendments would enhance and standardize disclosure about
specific aspects inherent to the SPAC structure at both the SPAC initial public offering stage and
the de-SPAC transaction stage. Requiring the SPAC and the target company to provide such
disclosure may in some cases afford market participants greater access to information relevant to
voting, redemption, and investment decisions. By increasing the standardization and
comparability of disclosures, the proposed rules may make it easier for investors to properly and
efficiently process information about SPACs and for market prices to reflect such information.
In addition, invested capital may be more likely to be more efficiently deployed.
Additionally, the proposed rules would increase the incentives for issuers and
underwriters to exercise the care necessary to ensure accuracy in disclosures by affirming the
underwriter status of SPAC IPO underwriters in connection with de-SPAC transactions and
proposing a new definition of “blank check company” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbor.
In addition, the proposed rules regarding shell company business combination transactions would
make certain disclosures and liabilities more consistent with traditional IPOs, which could
benefit investors and potentially decrease the cost of capital for shell companies. To the extent
that disclosure accuracy is improved, investors would have access to more reliable information
when making their investing decisions, which would lead to an increase in market efficiency.

559 As indicated in supra note 314, if a SPAC were to significantly change its asset composition contrary to its
original representations, it would raise questions whether the initial representations were false and misleading.
275
2. Competition
By improving the informational environment at the SPAC initial public offering and the
de-SPAC stages through changes in disclosure requirements and the scope of liability, the
proposed rules and amendments could encourage greater competition between SPAC sponsors
and SPAC underwriters, in both SPAC IPO and de-SPAC activities. For example, by
standardizing and increasing the comparability between the disclosures provided by SPACs, the
proposed rules and amendments may lead to improved investor awareness and more efficient
information processing. To the extent that the proposed rules and amendments lead to an
increase in competition between shell company mergers, including de-SPAC transactions, and
traditional initial public offerings, they may bring down the costs of capital raising through these
approaches.
If the proposed rules and amendments create significant costs that lead to a reduction in
shell company mergers and overall initial public offering activity in the SPAC market, this could
reduce competition for investment opportunities. Such a reduction could result in higher fees in
both the traditional IPO and SPAC markets. Additionally, if some of the proposed new rules and
amendments disincentivize underwriters and PIPE investors from participating in de-SPAC
transactions and related financings, it could reduce competition among service and capital
providers in the SPAC market and lead to higher fees.
To the extent that the proposed safe harbor from the Investment Company Act would
reduce the costs of compliance, it may encourage additional sponsor participation in the SPAC
market and thus encourage competition among SPACs. However, for potential SPACs that
would not meet the safe harbor conditions, the proposed safe harbor may increase the costs of
276
sponsoring a SPAC, and thus the proposed rule may have an adverse effect on competition
among SPACs.
3. Capital Formation
Enhanced disclosure at both the SPAC initial public offering and the de-SPAC stages,
combined with a stronger incentive to perform better due diligence in the de-SPAC transaction
stage, would likely improve investor protection at both stages. In addition, the proposed rules
and amendments for shell company mergers would likely improve investor protection. For
example, proposed Rule 145a would help shareholders of reporting shell companies more
consistently receive the full protections of the Securities Act disclosure and liability provisions in
business combinations involving reporting shell companies, regardless of the transaction
structure. Increased protections could incentivize more investors to invest in shell companies,
including SPACs, thus enhancing capital formation. In addition, to the extent that the proposed
safe harbor from the Investment Company Act reduces regulatory uncertainty and thus
encourages participation in SPACs, it may also lead to an increase in capital formation.560
If the proposed rules and amendments create significant costs for shell companies,
including SPACs, this may limit the number of private companies that go public through shell
companies, including a de-SPAC transaction mechanism, or at all.
561 Given the potential
increase in the cost of going public through a shell company merger such as a de-SPAC
transaction compared to the current baseline, it is possible that some private companies could
 560 As discussed in supra Section IX.C.5, an increase in investor demand for SPACs could potentially lower the cost
of capital for SPAC, which may increase the size and number of SPAC IPO offerings.
561 For example, as discussed in more detail in supra Section IX.C.5, for SPACs that would take advantage of the
proposed Investment Company Act Safe Harbor, the duration requirements could potentially lead investors to
anticipate less profitable de-SPAC transactions or a lower likelihood of completion of de-SPAC transactions, which,
in turn, could reduce investor demand for SPAC initial public offerings. Moreover, an increase in SPACs that
liquidate without a de-SPAC transaction and/or a reduction of capital raised through SPACs may ultimately result in
fewer publicly traded operating companies and therefore a reduced investment opportunity set for investors.
277
consider the traditional initial public offering channel a more viable alternative. We are not able
to estimate how many companies would consider using a traditional initial public offering
mechanism if the cost of the overall SPAC transaction structure increases. It is possible,
however, that a significant increase in the cost of shell company mergers and de-SPAC
transactions could deter some private companies from going public, and thus potentially reduce
overall initial public offering activity and capital formation.
E. Reasonable Alternatives
1. Disclosure-Related Proposals
a. Require Disclosure of Policies and Procedures That Address Conflicts
of Interest
As an alternative to Item 1603 as proposed, we could include a complementary
requirement to describe any policies and procedures used or to be used by a SPAC to minimize
potential or actual conflicts of interest related to disclosures provided in response to proposed
Items 1603(b) and 1603(c). Such information could assist investors in gauging the economic
significance, or lack thereof, of the various conflicts of interest given the presence, absence and
likely degree of effectiveness of the policies and procedures designed to address or ameliorate
them. On the other hand, requiring this information would increase compliance costs for SPACs
and may cause some of these companies to adopt policies and procedures that would not be
efficient or cost-effective given their particular organizational structure. In this regard, we note
that there could be incentives to provide such disclosure voluntarily, as it would indicate to
investors the degree to which conflicts of interest may be ameliorated.
b. Certain Reports, Opinions, or Appraisals
We are proposing to require the filing of reports, opinions, or appraisals provided to the
SPAC or its sponsor relating to valuation and/or fairness of a de-SPAC transaction or related
278
financing transactions (Item 1607) as exhibits to registration statements and schedules provided
in connection with a de-SPAC transaction. We are also proposing to require disclosures
summarizing the negotiation, report, opinion, or appraisal and certain additional disclosures,
such as for example, information about who prepared the report, opinion, or appraisal, and how
they were selected. .As an alternative, we could require disclosure of only a summary of the
reports, opinions, appraisals, and negotiations. This could reduce some of the costs of
compliance to the extent that it is more costly to obtain a report that will become public. At the
same time, this alternative would reduce the benefits of the disclosure, as investors and market
participants would have less information available to assess the quality and robustness of the
analysis underlying such report, opinion, or appraisal.
c. Require a Fixed Re-Determination Date to Measure Public Float
for Smaller Reporting Company Status
When re-determining a post-business combination company’s eligibility for smaller
reporting company status, instead of requiring the public float threshold to be measured as of a
date within four days after the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction, we could alternatively
require the re-determination to occur on a fixed date, such as the consummation date or on the
fourth day after consummation. A fixed re-determination date would have the benefit of
establishing a consistent date for all post-business combination companies to use and remove any
management judgment in the selection of a re-determination date, while still requiring that the
re-determination of smaller reporting company status occur before the post-business combination
company makes its first filing. However, reduced flexibility regarding the time frame within
which the required re-determination must be made could increase costs for post-business
combination companies without substantial additional benefits for investors.
279
d. Re-Determine Smaller Reporting Company Status of a PostBusiness Combination Company Without a Public Float Test
As another alternative, we considered whether the re-determination for smaller reporting
company status of the combined company following a de-SPAC transaction should require only
a re-measurement of the revenue component of smaller reporting company test and not its public
float component. Generally, smaller reporting company status is re-determined on an annual
basis based on the issuer’s public float as well as annual revenues. Revenues of the combined
company may be more relevant to smaller reporting company status than public float because,
generally, the target company has generated revenue while the SPAC has not done so.
Accordingly, the revenue test may be the more determinative factor than the public float test in
determining whether the combined company following de-SPAC transaction remains a smaller
reporting company because, based on staff experience, the public float of most SPACs and
subsequent combined companies typically is between $250 and $700 million, which exceeds the
public float threshold for smaller reporting company status. Also, the public float component of
this test is measured as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second
fiscal quarter. Given that the public float re-measurement likely would not occur at the end of
the second fiscal quarter when the annual public float measurement occurs, the combined
company may have to measure its public float more than one time during the same fiscal year,
which may impose additional burdens for the company.
However, compared to public float, revenue, if used as a sole basis of the significance
test, may be subject to a greater degree of managerial discretion.562 Also, using revenue alone
may expose a large number of investors to business-specific risks because SPAC targets may
 562 See Jenny Zha Giedt, Modelling Receivables and Deferred Revenues to Detect Revenue Management, 54 (2)
ABACUS 181, 181–209 (2018) (focusing on the SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases, i.e., AAER,
from 1982 to 2016, and documenting that forty-seven percent of all financial misstatements are related to revenue).
280
represent nascent industries that could feature extended pre- or low-revenue periods but, as
indicated above, may have a public float following a de-SPAC transaction that would exceed the
threshold for smaller reporting company status. Thus, we believe it is appropriate that these
companies should take the public float into account in re-determining smaller reporting company
status following the consummation of a de-SPAC transaction.
e. Structured Data Requirement
We could change the scope of the proposed Inline XBRL tagging requirements for the
proposed SPAC disclosures, such as by excluding certain subsets of registrants or disclosures.
For example, the tagging requirements could exclude the SPAC initial public offering
disclosures. Under such an alternative, SPACs would submit initial public offering disclosures
in unstructured HTML or ASCII and would not incur Inline XBRL compliance costs until their
first periodic filing on Form 10-Q, 20-F, or 40-F.563 This could make it incrementally easier for
SPACs to consummate an initial public offering. However, narrowing the scope of the proposed
tagging requirements, whether based on filing, offering size, or other criteria, would diminish the
extent of any informational benefits that would accrue as a result of the proposed disclosure
requirements by making the excluded disclosures comparatively costlier to process and analyze.
As another alternative, we could require only the quantitative SPAC-related disclosures
to be tagged in Inline XBRL. Excluding qualitative disclosures from the tagging requirements
could provide some incremental cost savings for registrants compared to the proposal, because
incrementally less time would be required to select and review the particular tags to apply to
 563 The Commission’s EDGAR electronic filing system generally requires filers to use ASCII or HTML for their
document submissions, subject to certain exceptions. See EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 61 (Mar.
2022), at 5-1; 17 CFR 232.301 (incorporating EDGAR Filer Manual into Regulation S-T). See also 17 CFR
232.101 (setting forth the obligation to file electronically on EDGAR).
281
quantitative disclosures. However, we expect these incremental cost savings would be low,
because SPACs would be subject to similar Inline XBRL requirements, including requirements
to tag quantitative and qualitative disclosures, in other Commission filings.564 Moreover,
narrowing the scope of tagging requirements to exclude qualitative information would diminish
the extent of informational benefits that would accrue to investors by inhibiting the efficient
extraction and searching of narrative SPAC-related disclosures (e.g., disclosures regarding
conflicts of interest, fairness determinations, and financial projections), thus creating the need to
manually review search results drawn from entire documents to find these disclosures.565 Such
an alternative would also inhibit the automatic comparison of narrative disclosures against prior
periods. It also may be harder for investors to perform a targeted assessment of a filing for
particular types of narrative SPAC-related disclosures because they would need to assess the
entire filing for relevant information.
2. Liability-Related Proposals
a. PSLRA Safe Harbor
As an alternative to addressing the use of projections in de-SPAC transactions and other
business combinations involving blank check companies that are not penny stock issuers by
proposing to amend the “blank check company” definition, we could have issued interpretive
guidance stating that the PSLRA safe harbor for forward-looking statements is not available
because business combinations with shell companies that are not penny stock issuers are “initial
 564 See supra Section IX.C.1.a.5.
565 To illustrate, without Inline XBRL, using a search string such as “dilution” to search through the text of all deSPAC filings, so as to determine the extent to which dilutive effects are among the material factors being considered
by SPACs at arriving at fairness determinations, could return many narrative disclosures outside of the fairness
determination disclosure that would be required by proposed Item 1606(b) of Regulation S-K, such as disclosures in
the risk factors section or in the description of stock incentive plans. However, if Inline XBRL is used, it would
enable a user to search for the term “dilution” exclusively within the proposed fairness determination disclosure,
thereby likely reducing the number of irrelevant results.
282
public offerings” by target private operating companies for purposes of the PSLRA. This
alternative would avoid some of the complexity associated with defining blank check companies
for purposes of the PSLRA, but issuing guidance rather than a rule may result in weaker
incentives for SPACs or target companies to take greater care in preparing forward-looking
statements, such as projections, in de-SPAC transactions and thus result in fewer investor
protection benefits than the proposed rule.
b. Issuing Guidance on Underwriter Status
Instead of proposing Rule 140a, the Commission could issue guidance that would
describe the factors that should be considered in determining underwriter status in connection
with de-SPAC transactions, which could potentially be relevant for parties other than SPAC IPO
underwriters. Issuing guidance rather than designating an underwriter by rule within the context
of these transactions might prompt the full range of parties involved in facilitating de-SPAC
transactions to consider their potential liability and thus take greater care in performing their
designated functions. This could result in more robust investor protections overall. On the other
hand, compared to the proposed rule, this alternative would rely on the judgment of de-SPAC
participants to apply the guidance and may result in weaker incentives for those parties that are
potentially subject to Section 11 liability to perform robust due diligence. As a result of such
weaker incentives, there could be a reduced impact on the accuracy of the disclosure in de-SPAC
transactions and investor protection benefits.
3. Expanding Disclosure in Reporting Shell Company Business
Combinations
Proposed Rule 145a would deem any business combination of a reporting shell company
(that is not a business combination-related shell company) involving another entity that is not a
shell company to involve a sale of securities to the reporting shell company’s shareholders. As
283
an alternative, instead of deeming all such transactions to be a sale that would need to be
registered under the Securities Act, absent an applicable exemption, we could expand the
disclosure requirements applicable to reporting shell company business combinations such that
the disclosure requirements would be the same as what would have been required if the
transaction was registered under the Securities Act. Under this alternative, regardless of the
document that is filed with the Commission (e.g., proxy or information statement, Schedule TO,
or Form 8-K), the set of disclosures investors receive would be the same as they would receive
had a registration statement been filed for the transaction. This would ensure that the reporting
shell company’s shareholders receive the same information regardless of how the transaction is
structured and would reduce regulatory arbitrage opportunities stemming from different
disclosure requirements in different documents that may be filed with the Commission to report a
shell company business combination. As a registration statement would not necessarily be
required in all transaction structures, the costs of such an alternative would also be less that the
costs of liability associated with the purchase and sale of securities and potential Securities Act
registration of shell company business combinations under proposed Rule 145a, to the extent no
exemption is available for the transaction.
However, merely expanding the set of disclosures investors receive regardless of
transaction structure does not provide investors with the same level of protection because the
liability standards differ based on the type of filing that is required. Only by deeming the
transaction to be a sale would investors necessarily receive the protections that apply in
connection with a purchase and sale of securities under the federal securities laws, such as the
availability of private actions under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. In addition, to the extent
there is not an available exemption for the reporting shell company business combination, only
284
with Securities Act registration do investors receive the full panoply of available protections
under that Act that they would receive in a traditional IPO, such as a private right of action under
Section 11.
4. Enhanced Projections Disclosures
The proposed amendments to Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K present our updated views on
projected performance measures and include a statement that projections based on a non-GAAP
financial measure should include a clear definition or explanation of the non-GAAP measure,
and a description of the GAAP financial measure to which it is most closely related. As an
alternative to this guidance, we could adopt a rule requiring firms, when providing projections, to
present a reconciliation of projections based on a non-GAAP measure to those based on the
nearest GAAP measure. While the reconciliation would further help investors understand the
bases of projections involving non-GAAP measures, it would likely also increase compliance
costs and in turn might reduce the provision of otherwise useful projections.
5. Investment Company Act Safe Harbor
a. Shorter Duration Limitations
As an alternative, we considered shorter duration limitations by instead requiring a SPAC
to announce a transaction no later than 12-months from the IPO registration date, and to
complete a de-SPAC transaction or liquidate the SPAC no later than 18-months after the IPO
registrations date. The benefit of this alternative is that it would further decrease the possibility
of regulatory arbitrage. It would also reduce the risk that investors may come to view a SPAC
holding securities as a fund-like investment, and the related risk of investor protection concerns.
We expect this alternative would impose the same type of costs we discussed above for the
proposed duration conditions, but at a greater magnitude. Based on a sample of SPACs with
285
effective IPO dates from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2020 (i.e., a sample of SPACs with at least
an 18-month history since the IPO date as of December 31, 2021; 189 SPACs in total), we find
that approximately 36% of the SPACs in the sample announced a transaction agreement no later
than 12-months after the date of the initial public offering and 40% of the SPACs had completed
a de-SPAC transaction no later than 18-months after the date of the initial public offering. The
proportion of SPACs in the sample that both announced a de-SPAC transaction by 12-months
and completed the de-SPAC transaction by 18-months was approximately 33%, which is a
significantly lower proportion compared to 57% of sample SPACs that would have managed to
meet both of the proposed duration conditions, as discussed above. Thus, we expect that costs
would be greater under this alternative by forcing a greater proportion of SPACs to conclude
their search for a target or liquidate earlier than they may otherwise do. In addition, because of
the tighter deadlines this alternative would impose, those SPACs that would be at risk of not
being able to meet the proposed longer duration conditions would likely be at comparatively
greater risk of not meeting the deadlines under this alternative, which may also increase the costs
such SPACs would face in trying to meet these alternative duration conditions.
b. No Announcement Condition
We also considered an alternative that would keep the 24-month condition for completion
of a de-SPAC transaction, but remove the duration condition for the announcement of a
transaction. This alternative would increase the proportion of SPACs meeting the duration
condition to 65% compared to 57% under the proposal. The benefit of this alternative would
thus be to increase the proportion of SPACs not having to potentially sub-optimally come to a
merger agreement earlier (or, in some circumstances, potentially inefficiently liquidating the
SPAC), while still imposing a firm 24-month maximum lifespan for SPACs seeking to take
286
advantage of the proposed safe harbor. However, by not imposing an 18-month announcement
condition investors would lose any investor protection benefits that may be associated with an
earlier signal of a SPAC’s intent to complete a de-SPAC transaction than they might receive
under this alternative.
c. Longer Duration Limitations
As an alternative, we could require a longer duration before a SPAC would have to
complete a de-SPAC transaction. For example, if we increase this duration to no later than 36
months after the IPO date (with no announcement condition), less than 4% of the sample SPACs
that completed a de-SPAC transition would not have met such a condition. As discussed above,
the national securities exchanges already require SPACs to complete a de-SPAC transaction
within 36 months (or 3 years). Thus, based on both the recent evidence and the current exchange
rules for SPACs, we expect that this alternative would not impose the potential costs of a
truncated search period for a target company for most SPACs, in particular SPACs with
exchange-traded securities. However, as discussed above, the longer the SPAC operates with its
assets invested in securities and its income derived from securities, the more likely investors will
come to view the SPAC as a fund-like investment and the more likely the SPAC appears to be
deviating from its stated business purpose. In turn, this may raise investor protection concerns
and increase the possibility of regulatory arbitrage compared to the proposed duration conditions.

X. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A. Summary of the Collections of Information
Certain provisions of our rules, schedules, and forms that would be affected by the
proposed new rules and amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the
meaning of the PRA.566 We are submitting the proposed new rules and amendments to the
 566 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
292
Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review and approval in accordance with the
PRA and its implementing regulations.
567 The hours and costs associated with preparing, filing
and sending the schedules and forms, and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens
imposed by each collection of information.568 An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a
person is not required to comply with, a collection of information requirement unless it displays
a currently valid OMB control number. The titles for the collections of information are:
• Regulation 14A (Commission Rules 14a-1 through 14a-21 and Schedule 14A) (OMB
Control No. 3235-0059);
• Regulation 14C (Commission Rules 14c-1 through 14c-7 and Schedule 14C) (OMB
Control No. 3235-0057);
• Schedule TO (OMB Control No. 3235-0515);
• Form S-1 (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);
• Form S-4 (OMB Control No. 3235-0324);
• Form F-1 (OMB Control No. 3235-0258);
• Form F-4 (OMB Control No. 3235-0325);
• Form 10-K (OMB Control No. 3235-0063);
• Form 10-Q (OMB Control No. 3235-0070); and
• Rule 3a-10 under the Investment Company Act (a proposed new collection of
information).569
 567 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.
568 The paperwork burdens for Regulation S-X, Regulation S-K, Regulation C, Regulation 12B, and Regulation S-T
are imposed through the forms, schedules and reports that are subject to the requirements in these regulations and
are reflected in the analysis of those documents.
569 We estimate that there would be a negligible or no change in burden to Form 20-F and Form 8-K as a result of
the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, in that these proposed amendments would be codifying existing
293
The forms, schedules, and regulations listed above were adopted under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, and/or the Investment Company Act. These regulations, schedules, and forms
set forth the disclosure requirements for registration statements, annual and quarterly reports,
current reports, proxy and information statements, and tender offer statements filed by registrants
to provide investors with information to make informed investment, voting, and redemption
decisions. In addition, we are proposing a new requirement that certain entities adopt a board
resolution in order to rely on the safe harbor provided by proposed Rule 3a-10 of the Investment
Company Act. Compliance with these information collections is mandatory to the extent
applicable to each registrant.
570 Other than the proposed new collection of information (Rule 3a10 under the Investment Company Act), responses to these information collections are not kept
confidential, and there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed.
Responses to the information collection under the Investment Company Act are kept
confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law.
A description of the proposed new rules and amendments, including the need for the
information and its use, as well as a description of the likely respondents, can be found in
Sections II through VI above, and a discussion of the economic effects of the proposed new rules
and amendments can be found in Section IX above.
B. Estimates of the Effects of the Proposed New Rules and Amendments on the
Collections of Information

interpretations of existing rules. Accordingly, we are not making any revisions to the PRA burden estimates for
Form 20-F and Form 8-K at this time.
570 Registrants claiming smaller reporting company status have the option to comply with the scaled disclosures
available to them on an item-by-item basis. In addition, if an entity determines not to rely on the safe harbor
provided in Rule 3a-10 of the Investment Company Act, it would not be required to adopt the board resolution
contemplated in that proposed rule.

Proposed Amendments to Regulation S-X
Amend financial statement requirements and the
forms and schedules filed in connection with
business combination transactions involving shell
companies (other than business combination
related shell companies), including de-SPAC
transactions, to more closely align required
disclosures about the target private operating
company with those required in a Form S-1 or F-1
for an initial public offering, including:
• Expanding the circumstances in which target
companies may report two years, instead of three
years, of audited financial statements (resulting
in a net decrease in burden) (proposed Rule 15-
01(b)); and
• Further aligning the requirements for audited
financial statements in these transactions with
those required in a registered initial public
offering (resulting in a net decrease in burden)
(proposed Rule 15-01(c), (d) and (e)).
• Forms S-4 and F-4
• Schedules 14A and
14C
• Schedule TO

Proposed Requirement and Effects Affected Forms and
Schedules
Estimated Effect Per
Affected Response*
Proposed Amendments to Align Non-Financial
Statement Disclosures in De-SPAC
Transactions
• Amend the forms and schedules filed in
connection with de-SPAC transactions to more
closely align required non-financial statement
disclosures about the target private operating
company with those required in a Form S-1 or F1 for an initial public offering.
• Forms S-4 and F-4
• Schedules 14A and
14C
• Schedule TO

compliance burden per
Form S-4 or F-4
• 8 hour increase in

Schedule 14A or 14C
• 8 hour increase in

Schedule TO
Proposed Amendment to Forms S-4 and F-4
• Amend Form S-4 and Form F-4 to require that
the SPAC and the target private operating
company be treated as co-registrants when the
Form S-4 or Form F-4 is filed by the SPAC in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction
• Forms S-4 and F-4 • 100 hour increase in
compliance burden per
Form S-4 or F-4***
Proposed Rule 3a-10 under the Investment
Company Act
• Require the board of directors of a SPAC relying
on Rule 3a-10 to adopt an appropriate resolution
evidencing that SPAC is primarily engaged in
the business of seeking to complete a single deSPAC transaction.
• None • 1 hour increase in
compliance burden per
SPAC
Notes:
* Estimated effect expressed as increase or decrease of burden hours on average and, as applicable, derived
from Commission staff review of samples of relevant sections of the affected forms.
** We arrive at an estimate for these amendments to Regulation S-X on the assumption that approximately
30% of affected responses would require one fewer year of audited financial statements under proposed Rule
15-01(b) than under the current rules from registrants that would not otherwise have prepared financial
statements for such year. Coupled with an incremental increase in burden for the proposed amendments to
Regulation S-X other than proposed Rule 15-01(b), when this decrease is spread across all affected
responses, we arrive at a net burden decrease of 50 hours.
*** The estimated 100 hour increase in burden is based on an estimate of the additional time that a target
company, as a co-registrant, would spend on preparing disclosures in a Form S-4 or F-4 filed by a SPAC for
a de-SPAC transaction.
In addition, we are proposing to require that a post-business combination company redetermine whether it is a smaller reporting company (SRC) following a de-SPAC transaction.
As proposed, the post-business combination company would be required to reflect this re-
298
determination in its first periodic report after the de-SPAC transaction and in Commission filings
thereafter until its next annual re-determination of SRC status. We estimate that the proposed redetermination of SRC status would result in increased burdens in filing Forms 10-K, Forms 10-
Q, Schedules 14A, Schedules 14C, and Forms S-1 for those post-business combination
companies that would lose SRC status, which takes into account the increased incremental
burden in providing disclosures pursuant to non-SRC disclosure requirements. The following
Table 2 sets forth our estimates regarding the increase in compliance burden when a postbusiness combination company loses SRC status:
PRA Table 2. Increase in Compliance Burden After Losing SRC Status
Form / Schedule Estimated Increase in
Internal Hours per
Filing
Estimated Increase in
Outside Professional Hours

Estimated Increase in
Outside Professional
Costs per Filing
Form 10-K* 439 147 $58,800
Form 10-Q* 36.57 11.88 $4,752
Schedule 14A** 0.75 0.25 $100
Schedule 14C*** 0.75 0.25 $100
Form S-1* 5.75 17.25 $6,900
Notes:
* The estimated increases in compliance burdens are based on the difference between the current estimates for
the applicable form and the estimated burden for SRCs in filing the form. We estimate the compliance burden for
an SRC in filing these forms using the same methodology as in 2018 when the Commission amended the smaller
reporting company definition. See Smaller Reporting Company Definition, Release No. 33-10513 (June 28,
2018) [83 FR 31992 (July 10, 2018)], at section V.
** In regard to Schedule 14A, we estimate that a company that loses SRC status would experience an increased
compliance burden of 0.75 internal burden hours and a cost of $100 (0.25 professional hours x $400/hour) per
schedule, based on our estimate of the compliance burden for 17 CFR 229.407(d)(5) and (e)(4) and (5) (Item
407(d)(5) and (e)(4) and (5) of Regulation S-K), with which smaller reporting companies are not required to
comply.
*** Similar to Schedule 14A, we estimate that, in regard to Schedule 14C, a company that loses SRC status
would experience an increased compliance burden of 0.75 burden hours and a cost of $100 (0.25 professional
hours x $400/hour) per report, based on our estimate of the compliance burden for Item 407(d)(5) and (e)(4) and
(5) of Regulation S-K.
299
C. Incremental and Aggregate Burden and Cost Estimates
We estimate below the incremental and aggregate increase in paperwork burden as a
result of the proposed new rules and amendments. These estimates represent the average burden
for all respondents, both large and small. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the
burdens will likely vary among individual respondents based on a number of factors, including
the size and complexity of their business. These estimates include the time and the cost of
preparing and reviewing disclosure, filing documents, and retaining records. We believe that
some registrants will experience costs in excess of this average and some registrants will
experience less than the average costs. Our methodologies for deriving these estimates are
discussed below.
Our estimates represent the burden for all SPACs that file registration statements with the
Commission for registered offerings and all registrants that file disclosure documents in
connection with a de-SPAC transaction or a business combination involving a shell company or
a reporting shell company.571 Additionally, our estimates take into account an expected increase
in the number of Securities Act registration statements as a result of proposed Rule 145a. Based
on a review of Commission filings during the period 2011 – 2021 and an analysis of the effects
of the proposed new rules and amendments,572 the staff estimates that:
• SPACs will file an average of 90 registration statements each year for registered offerings
on Form S-1 and 8 registration statements on Form F-1, other than for de-SPAC
transactions;
 571 Throughout this release and as stated earlier, we use “shell company” and “reporting shell company” in lieu of
the phrases “shell company, other than a business combination related shell company” and “reporting shell
company, other than a business combination related shell company.”
572 We based our estimates, in part, on a review of Commission filings over a 10-year period because we believe
that this longer timeframe would more accurately reflect the average number of registration statements filed by
SPACs and disclosure documents for de-SPAC transactions in a given year.
300
• An average of 30 registration statements on Form S-4 and 4 registration statements on
Form F-4, 30 definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A, 4 definitive information
statements on Schedule 14C, and 2 tender offer statements on Schedule TO will be filed
each year in connection with de-SPAC transactions; and
• An average of 20 registration statements on Form S-4 and 2 registration statements on
Form F-4 will be filed each year for business combination transactions involving a
reporting shell company and a non-shell company, other than de-SPAC transactions.573
For purposes of the PRA, the burden is allocated between internal burden hours and
outside professional costs. The portion of the burden carried by outside professionals is reflected
as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried by the company internally is reflected in hours.
The following Table 3 sets forth the percentage estimates we use for the burden allocation for
each form and schedule, consistent with current OMB estimates and recent Commission
rulemakings. We estimate that the average cost of retaining outside professionals is $400 per
hour.574
PRA Table 3. Standard Estimated Burden Allocation for Specified Forms, Schedules, and
Records
Form / Schedule / Record Type Internal Outside Professionals
Forms S-1, F-1, S-4, and F-4 25% 75%
Schedules 14A and 14C 75% 25%
Schedule TO 25% 75%
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q 75% 25%
 573 This estimate represents the upper bound of the estimated number of Forms S-4 and F-4 filed for these
transactions.
574 We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would be an average of
$400 per hour. This is the rate we typically estimate for outside legal services used in connection with public
company reporting.

Notes:
+ As discussed above, we believe that proposed Rule 3a-10 would offer market participants a number of benefits,
including the reduction of compliance costs for some market participants. As a result, while no SPAC would be
required to rely on Rule 3a-10, for purposes of this analysis, we assume that all SPACs conducting an initial
302
public offering subsequent to adoption of the proposed rule would rely on proposed Rule 3a-10 and, therefore,
prepare a board resolution in accordance with the conditions of Rule 3a-10.

In addition, we estimate that an average of 50 fewer post-business combination
companies following a de-SPAC transaction will qualify as smaller reporting companies than
under the current rules until the next annual re-determination date.
575 While we cannot predict
with certainty the number of these post-business combination companies, we estimate for
purposes of our PRA calculations that currently all post-business combination companies qualify
as SRCs following de-SPAC transactions in which the SPAC is the legal acquirer and that 80%
of these companies that are eligible to use the scaled SRC disclosure provisions do so.576 We
 575 This estimate is based, in part, on our estimate of the number of de-SPAC transactions in which the SPAC is the
legal acquirer.
576 This estimated realization rate is based on the same methodology and data set forth in Release No. 33-10513,
Section V.D. Though the estimated realization rate in Release No. 33-10513 preceded the effective date of the
amendments to the smaller reporting company definition in 2018, we expect that the current realization rate for
eligible companies using the scaled SRC disclosure provisions to be generally consistent with the estimated
realization rate in 2018.
303
estimate that these registrants would file, on average, one Form 10-K, 1.5 Forms 10-Q, one
Schedule 14A, and one registration statement on Form S-1 prior to the next re-determination of
SRC status.
The following Table 6 summarizes the estimated effects of the proposed re-determination
of SRC status on the paperwork burdens associated with the affected forms and schedules:

• Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collections of information
on those who respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology; and
• Evaluate whether the proposed new rules and amendments would have any effects on any
other collection of information not previously identified in this section.
Any member of the public may direct to us any comments concerning the accuracy of
these burden estimates and any suggestions for reducing these burdens. Persons submitting
comments on the collection of information requirements should direct their comments to the
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and send a
copy to, Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F
Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File No. S7-13-22. Requests for
materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to the collection of information
should be in writing, refer to File No. S7-13-22 and be submitted to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington DC 20549-2736.
OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collections of information between 30 and
60 days after publication of this release. Consequently, a comment to OMB is best assured of
having its full effect if the OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
XI. SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”),577 the Commission must advise the OMB as to whether a proposed regulation
 577 Pub. L. No. 104-121, Tit. II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).
306
constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it
results or is likely to result in:
• An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an
increase or a decrease);
• A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or
• Significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.
If a rule is “major,” its effectiveness will generally be delayed for 60 days pending Congressional
review.
We request comment on whether our proposed amendments would be a “major rule” for
purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on:
• The potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;
• Any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and
• Any potential effect on competition, investment or innovation.
We request those submitting comments to provide empirical data and other factual support for
their views to the extent possible.
XII. INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS AND CERTIFICATION
The Regulatory Flexibility Act578 requires an agency, when issuing a rulemaking
proposal, to prepare and make available for public comment an Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (“IRFA”) that describes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities, unless the
Commission certifies that the rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities.579 This IRFA has been prepared in accordance with the
 578 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
579 5 U.S.C. 603(a); 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
307
Regulatory Flexibility Act. It relates to the proposed new rules and amendments described in
Sections II through VI above.
A. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action
As discussed throughout the release, we are proposing new Subpart 1600 of Regulation
S-K and amendments to existing forms and schedules to require specialized disclosures in
registered offerings by SPACs, including initial public offerings, and in disclosure documents for
de-SPAC transactions with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors,
conflicts of interest, and dilution. For de-SPAC transactions, we are also proposing to require
disclosure of a fairness determination, additional disclosures on the target private operating
company, a re-determination of smaller reporting company status following the completion of a
de-SPAC transaction, and a minimum dissemination period for certain disclosure documents in
these transactions. These proposed rules and amendments would be applicable to, depending on
the circumstances, registration statements on Forms S-1, F-1, S-4 and F-4 filed under the
Securities Act and Schedules 14A, 14C and TO under the Exchange Act. The proposed rules
would also clarify the underwriter status of SPAC IPO underwriters in connection with de-SPAC
transactions and would require that the target company be named as a co-registrant in a Form S-4
or F-4 filed by a SPAC for a de-SPAC transaction. Further, we are proposing to amend the
definition of “blank check company” for purposes of the PSLRA such that the safe harbor under
the PSLRA for forward-looking information would not be available to SPACs and certain other
blank check companies; to update and expand our guidance in Item 10(b) of Regulation S-K
regarding the use of projections in Commission filings;580 and to require additional disclosure
 580 Item 10(b) sets forth guidelines representing the Commission’s views on important factors to be considered in
formulating and disclosing management’s projections of future economic performance in Commission filings.
308
when projections are disclosed in connection with de-SPAC transactions.
In regard to business combination transactions involving a reporting shell company,581
we are proposing Securities Act Rule 145a to deem these transactions with a non-shell company
to involve a sale of securities to the shell company’s shareholders. In addition, we are proposing
amendments to the financial statement reporting requirements for transactions involving shell
companies in Regulation S-X. Finally, we are proposing a new safe harbor, Rule 3a-10, under
the Investment Company Act that would provide that a SPAC that satisfies the conditions of the
safe harbor would not be an investment company and therefore would not be subject to
regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
The need for and objectives of the proposed rules and amendments are discussed in more
detail in Sections II – VI above. We discuss the economic impact, including the estimated costs
and burdens, of the proposed rules and amendments on all registrants, including small entities, in
Sections IX and X above.
B. Legal Basis
We are proposing the new rules and rule amendments under the authority set forth in
Sections 6, 7, 10, 19(a), and 28 of the Securities Act; Sections 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 23(a), and 36 of
the Exchange Act; and Sections 6(c) and 38(a) of the Investment Company Act.
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
Pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission hereby
certifies that proposed Rule 3a-10 under the Investment Company Act would not, if adopted,
 581 Throughout this release and as stated earlier, we use “shell company” and “reporting shell company” in lieu of
the phrases “shell company, other than a business combination related shell company” and “reporting shell
company, other than a business combination related shell company.”
309
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.582 Based on
information available to the Commission, there were 861 initial public offerings conducted by
SPACs in 2020 and 2021, of which 6 were for SPACs that sold $50 million or less in units.583
As a result, we believe that approximately 0.7% of SPACs directly affected by proposed Rule
3a-10 would be small entities.584 Accordingly, the Commission believes that proposed Rule 3a10 would not, if adopted, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.
D. Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rules and Amendments
The proposed rules and amendments would apply to registrants that are small entities.
The Regulatory Flexibility Act defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small
organization,” or “small governmental jurisdiction.”585 17 CFR 230.157 (Securities Act Rule
157) defines an issuer, other than an investment company, to be a “small business” or “small
organization” for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act if it had total assets of $5 million or
less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an
offering of securities not exceeding $5 million. 17 CFR 240.0-10(a) (Exchange Act Rule 0-
10(a)) defines an issuer, other than an investment company, to be a “small business” or “small
organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal
year. An investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment companies in
 582 The definition of “small entity” is set forth in Section XII.D below.
583 Based on data from Dealogic M&A module as of Jan. 2022.
584 While no SPAC would be required to rely on proposed Rule 3a-10, for purposes of this analysis, we assume that
all SPACs conducting an initial public offering subsequent to adoption of the proposed rule would rely on proposed
Rule 3a-10.
585 5 U.S.C. 601(6).
310
the same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50 million or less as of the
end of its most recent fiscal year.586
The proposed specialized disclosure and other requirements applicable to SPACs would
not apply to issuers that raise less than $5 million at the time of their initial public offerings.587
However, we acknowledge that there may be instances where a SPAC may be a small entity at
the time of a subsequent registered offering or at the time of a de-SPAC transaction.588 While
we are not aware to date of any such instances, we request comment on the number of these
small entities. In addition, due to data limitations, we are unable to estimate the number of
potential target private operating companies in de-SPAC transactions that may be small
entities;589 therefore, we request comment on the number of these small entities.
In regard to proposed Rule 145a and the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, we
estimate that there are 163 reporting shell companies that are small entities.590 However, due to
data limitations, we are unable to estimate the number of private operating companies and
private shell companies that are small entities that may engage in a business combination
transaction.591 We request comment on the number of these small entities.
 586 See 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).
587 See supra note 12 and the discussion of the proposed definition of “special purpose acquisition company” in
Section II.A.
588 As noted above, the vast majority of initial public offerings by SPACs in 2020 and 2021 raised more than $50
million. In 2020, the smallest amount raised in an initial public offering by a SPAC was $40 million, and, in 2021,
the smallest amount raised in an initial public offering by a SPAC was $44 million. When viewed over a 10-year
period, we do not expect the outcome to be different due to how SPACs are structured to address Rule 419. See
supra note 12. Further, with respect to proposed Rule 140a, we do not expect any underwriters in SPAC initial
public offerings to be small entities.
589 In this regard, we note that exchange listing requirements and provisions in the governing instruments of many
SPACs, along with how SPACs are structured to avoid the application of Rule 419, make it less likely that SPACs
would merge with or acquire a small entity. See supra notes 12 and 13.
590 This estimate does not include business combination related shell companies.
591 We believe that it is unlikely that a reporting company would engage in a business combination transaction with
a shell company such that it would be subject to proposed Rule 145a. Therefore, we are not estimating the number
of reporting companies for purposes of this analysis.
311
E. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements
We expect that the proposed specialized disclosure and other requirements applicable to
SPACs and target private operating companies would have an incremental effect on reporting,
recordkeeping and other compliance burdens for registrants, including small entities. These
proposed requirements would increase compliance costs for registrants, and compliance with
these proposed requirements would require the use of professional skills, including accounting,
legal, and technical skills. We generally expect that the nature of any benefits and costs
associated with the proposed rules and amendments to be similar for large and small entities.
We also anticipate that the economic benefits and costs likely could vary among small entities
based on a number of factors, such as the nature and conduct of their businesses, which makes it
difficult to project the economic impact on small entities with precision.592 The proposed rules
and amendments are discussed in detail in Sections II – VI above. We discuss the economic
effect, including the estimated costs and burdens, of the proposed rules and amendments on all
registrants, including small entities, in Section IX above.
Proposed Rule 145a, in deeming certain business combination transactions involving a
reporting shell company to involve a sale of securities to the reporting shell company’s
shareholders, may impose reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance requirements and related
costs on small entities that are reporting shell companies to the extent such a deemed sale of
securities would require such a small entity to register the transaction under the Securities Act or
comply with an exemption from registration. These costs could also include the costs associated
with the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, which would require an issuer in a business
 592 We do not expect the proposed re-determination of smaller reporting company status following a de-SPAC
transaction to have any effect on small entities because we do not expect any small entities to lose smaller reporting
company following this re-determination, based on the public float and revenue thresholds in the smaller reporting
company definition.
312
combination transaction involving a shell company to comply with financial statement reporting
requirements that would align with those applicable in traditional initial public offerings. The
proposed changes to the financial statement requirements would increase compliance costs for
small entities when these transactions are registered under the Securities Act, although we do not
expect the increase in incremental compliance costs resulting from the proposed amendments to
be significant because the proposed amendments would codify existing staff guidance on
financial statement requirements for these transactions.
F. Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules
The proposed disclosure requirements in Subpart 1600 may partially duplicate and
overlap with a number of existing disclosure requirements under Regulation S-K that are
currently applicable to SPAC registered offerings and in de-SPAC transactions. To the extent
that the disclosure requirements in proposed Subpart 1600 overlap with these existing disclosure
requirements, the requirements of proposed Subpart 1600 would be controlling. Other than these
proposed disclosure requirements, the Commission believes that the proposed new rules and
amendments would not duplicate, overlap or conflict with other federal rules.
G. Significant Alternatives
The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish
our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small entities.
Accordingly, we considered several alternatives, including the following:
• Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into
account the resources available to small entities;
• Clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under the
rules for small entities;
313
• Using performance rather than design standards; and
• Exempting small entities from all or part of the requirements.
The proposed specialized disclosure and other requirements with respect to SPAC
registered offerings and de-SPAC transactions are intended to improve the usefulness and clarity
of the information provided to investors so that they can make better informed decisions as to
whether to purchase securities in SPAC registered offerings, or in secondary trading markets,
and in voting, investment and redemption decisions in connection with de-SPAC transactions.
They are also intended to enhance investor protections as well as provide additional clarity
regarding the legal obligations of target companies and others in connection with a de-SPAC
transaction. We believe that these proposed requirements are equally appropriate for SPACs of
all sizes that are engaged in a registered offering and for SPACs and target private operating
companies that are engaged in a de-SPAC transaction. As a result, we do not believe that it is
appropriate to propose different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities; clarify,
consolidate or simplify compliance and reporting requirements for small entities; or to exempt
small entities from these requirements. As noted above, in our view, a private operating
company’s method of becoming a public company should not negatively impact investor
protection.
With respect to using performance rather than design standards, these proposed
requirements use primarily design standards in order to promote uniform compliance
requirements for all registrants. Further, we believe that the proposed requirements would be
more beneficial to investors if there are specific disclosure requirements that apply to all
registrants, regardless of size, for the reasons discussed above.
Proposed Rule 145a would deem business combinations involving a reporting shell
314
company and a non-shell company to involve a sale of securities to the reporting shell
company’s shareholders. Given that proposed Rule 145a is intended to address potential
disparities in the disclosure and liability protections available to reporting shell company
shareholders, we do not believe that it is appropriate to propose different compliance or reporting
requirements for small entities; clarify, consolidate or simplify compliance and reporting
requirements for small entities; or to exempt small entities from the proposed rule.
The proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would generally codify existing staff
guidance on financial statement requirements for certain business combinations involving shell
companies, and, based on staff analysis of disclosures in these transactions, we believe that most
companies already report consistent with this staff guidance. Further, the amendments are not
expected to have any significant adverse effect on small entities (and are, in fact, expected to
relieve burdens for some of these entities). Accordingly, we do not believe that it is necessary to
exempt small entities from all or part of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X; establish
different compliance or reporting requirements for such entities; or clarify, consolidate or
simplify compliance and reporting requirements for small entities. Likewise, while we primarily
use design standards to promote consistency, we do not believe it is necessary to use
performance standards in connection with this aspect of the proposed rules.
H. Request for Comment
We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this IRFA and
certifications. In particular, we request comments regarding:
• The number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules and amendments;
• The existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed rules and amendments on
small entities discussed in the analysis;
315
• How the proposed amendments could further lower the burden on small entities; and
• How to quantify the impact of the proposed rules and amendments.
Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any impact and provide empirical data
supporting the extent of the impact. Comments will be considered in the preparation of the Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed rules and amendments are adopted, and will be
placed in the same public file as comments on the proposed rules and amendments themselves.

text to read as follows:
§ 210.1-02 Definitions of terms used in Regulation S-X (17 CFR part 210).

(d) Audit (or examination). The term audit (or examination), when used in regard to
financial statements of issuers as defined by Section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
means an examination of the financial statements by an independent accountant in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”) for the purpose of expressing an opinion thereon. See § 210.15-01(a) for definition
of an audit when used in regard to financial statements of a company that will be a predecessor to
an issuer that is a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company).
When used in regard to financial statements of entities that are not issuers as defined by Section
2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the term means an examination of the financial
statements by an independent accountant in accordance with either the standards of the PCAOB
317
or U.S. generally accepted auditing standards (“U.S. GAAS”) as specified or permitted in the
regulations and forms applicable to those entities for the purpose of expressing an opinion
thereon. The standards of the PCAOB and U.S. GAAS may be modified or supplemented by the
Commission.

(1) The term significant subsidiary means a subsidiary, including its subsidiaries, which
meets any of the conditions in paragraph (w)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section; however if the
registrant is a registered investment company or a business development company, the tested
subsidiary meets any of the conditions in paragraph (w)(2) of this section instead of any of the
conditions in this paragraph (w)(1). In either an acquisition by a shell company (other than a
business combination related shell company) of a business that is not the predecessor or an
acquisition by the shell company’s predecessor, use the predecessor’s financial statements
instead of the registrant and the subsidiaries consolidated in applying the significance tests in
paragraphs (w)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.

3. Amend § 210.3-01 by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:
§ 210.3-01 Consolidated balance sheets.
(a) There shall be filed, for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and for its
predecessors, audited balance sheets as of the end of each of the two most recent fiscal years. If
the registrant has been in existence for less than one fiscal year, there shall be filed an audited
balance sheet as of a date within 135 days of the date of filing the registration statement.

company), that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements of a recently
consummated business acquisition pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must file those
financial statements and any pro forma information specified by §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-03
(Article 11) under cover of Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter) no later than 75 days after
consummation of the acquisition. A shell company (other than a business combination related
shell company) that acquires a business, which is not or will not be its predecessor, that omits

(ii) A registrant, other than a foreign private issuer required to file reports on Form 6-K
(§ 249.306 of this chapter) or shell company (other than a business combination related shell
company), that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements of a recently
consummated acquisition of a real estate operation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section
must file those financial statements and any pro forma information specified by §§ 210.11-01
through 210.11-03 (Article 11) under cover of Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter) no later than
75 days after consummation of the acquisition. A shell company (other than a business
combination related shell company) that acquires a real estate operation, which is not or will not
be its predecessor that omits from a registration statement or proxy statement the financial
statements of a recently consummated business acquisition pursuant to (b)(4)(i) of this section
shall refer to § 210.15-01(d)(2).

6. Amend § 210.8-02 by revising it to read as follows:
§ 210.8-02 Annual financial statements.
Smaller reporting companies shall file an audited balance sheet for the registrant and for
its predecessors as of the end of each of the most recent two fiscal years, or as of a date within
135 days if the issuer has existed for a period of less than one fiscal year, and audited statements
of comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the two
fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as
the registrant has been in business).
7. Amend § 210.10-01 by revising paragraph (a)(1) to read as follows:
§ 210.10-01 Interim financial statements.
(a) * * *
320
(1) Interim financial statements required by this rule need only be provided as to the
registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and its predecessors and may be unaudited. Separate
statements of other entities which may otherwise be required by this regulation may be omitted.

8. Amend § 210.11-01 by revising paragraph (d) introductory text to read as follows:
§ 210.11-01 Presentation requirements.
* * * * *
(d) For purposes of this rule, the term business should be evaluated in light of the facts
and circumstances involved and whether there is sufficient continuity of the acquired entity's
operations prior to and after the transactions so that disclosure of prior financial information is
material to an understanding of future operations. A presumption exists that a separate entity, a
subsidiary, or a division is a business. A special purpose acquisition company, as defined in
§ 229.1601(a), is a business for purposes of this rule. However, a lesser component of an entity
may also constitute a business. Among the facts and circumstances which should be considered
in evaluating whether an acquisition of a lesser component of an entity constitutes a business are
the following:

9. Amend part 210 by adding an undesignated center heading and § 210.15-01 to
read as follows:
Acquisitions of Businesses by a Shell Company (Other Than a Business Combination
Related Shell Company)
Sec.
321
210.15-01 Acquisitions of businesses by a shell company (other than a business
combination related shell company).
§ 210.15-01 Acquisitions of businesses by a shell company (other than a business
combination related shell company).
(a) Audit requirements of predecessor. The term audit (or examination), when used in
regard to financial statements of a business that is or will be a predecessor to a shell company
(other than a business combination related shell company), means an examination of the
financial statements by an independent accountant in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB for the purpose of expressing an opinion thereon.
(b) Financial statements. When the registrant is a shell company (other than a business
combination related shell company) and the financial statements of a business that will be a
predecessor to the registrant are required in a registration statement or proxy statement, the
registrant must file financial statements of the business in accordance with §§ 210.3-01 to 210.3-
12 and 210.10-01 (Articles 3 and 10 of Regulation S-X) as if the filing were a Securities Act
registration statement for the initial public offering of the business's equity securities. The
financial statements of the business may be filed pursuant to §§ 210.8-01 to 210.8-08 (Article 8)
when that business would qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual
revenues as of the most recently completed fiscal year, if it were filing a registration statement
itself.
(c) Age of financial statements of the predecessor. The financial statements of a business
that will be a predecessor to a shell company (other than a business combination related shell
company) shall comply with the requirements in § 210.3-12 (§ 210.8-08 when that business
would qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most
322
recently completed fiscal year, if it were filing a registration statement itself) in determining the
age of financial statements of the predecessor business in the registration statement or proxy
statement of the registrant.
(d) Acquisitions of businesses by a shell company or its predecessor that are not or will
not be the predecessor. Registrants shall apply § 210.3-05 (§ 210.8-04 when that business would
qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most recently
completed fiscal year if it were filing a registration statement itself) to acquisitions of businesses
by a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) or its predecessor
that are not or will not be the predecessor to the registrant.
(1) See § 210.1-02(w)(1) for rules on applying the significance tests to acquisitions of
businesses by a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) or its
predecessor that are not or will not be the predecessor.
(2) A shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) that omits
from a registration statement or proxy statement the financial statements of a recently acquired
business that is not or will not be its predecessor pursuant to Rule 3-05(b)(4)(i) of Regulation SX (§ 210.1-02(b)(4)(i)) must file those financial statements in its Form 8-K filed pursuant to Item
2.01(f).
(e) Financial statements of shell company. After a shell company (other than a business
combination related shell company) acquires a business that is its predecessor, the financial
statements of the shell company for periods prior to consummation of the acquisition are not
required to be included in a filing once the financial statements of the predecessor have been
filed for all required periods through the acquisition date and the financial statements of the
registrant include the period in which the acquisition was consummated.

a. Revising paragraph (b); and
b. Adding paragraph (f)(2)(iv).
The revisions and additions read as follows.
§ 229.10 (Item 10) General
* * * * *
(b) Commission policy on projections. The Commission encourages the use in
documents specified in Rule 175 under the Securities Act (§ 230.175 of this chapter) and Rule
3b-6 under the Exchange Act (§ 240.3b-6 of this chapter) of management’s projections of future
economic performance that have a reasonable basis and are presented in an appropriate format.
The guidelines set forth herein represent the Commission’s views on important factors to be
considered in formulating and disclosing such projections. These guidelines also apply to
projections of future economic performance of persons other than the registrant, such as the
324
target company in a business combination transaction, that are included in the registrant’s
Commission filings.
(1) Basis for projections. The Commission believes that management must have the
option to present in Commission filings its good faith assessment of a registrant’s future
performance. Management, however, must have a reasonable basis for such an assessment.
Although a history of operations or experience in projecting may be among the factors providing
a basis for management's assessment, the Commission does not believe that a registrant always
must have had such a history or experience in order to formulate projections with a reasonable
basis. An outside review of management’s projections may furnish additional support for having
a reasonable basis for a projection. If management decides to include a report of such a review
in a Commission filing, there also should be disclosure of the qualifications of the reviewer, the
extent of the review, the relationship between the reviewer and the registrant, and other material
factors concerning the process by which any outside review was sought or obtained. Moreover,
in the case of a registration statement under the Securities Act, the reviewer would be deemed an
expert and an appropriate consent must be filed with the registration statement.
(2) Format for projections.
(i) In determining the appropriate format for projections included in Commission filings,
consideration must be given to, among other things, the financial items to be projected, the
period to be covered, and the manner of presentation to be used. Although traditionally
projections have been given for three financial items generally considered to be of primary
importance to investors (revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share), projection
information need not necessarily be limited to these three items. However, management should
take care to assure that the choice of items projected is not susceptible of misleading inferences
325
through selective projection of only favorable items. Revenues, net income (loss) and earnings
(loss) per share usually are presented together in order to avoid any misleading inferences that
may arise when the individual items reflect contradictory trends. There may be instances,
however, when it is appropriate to present earnings (loss) from continuing operations in addition
to or in lieu of net income (loss). It generally would be misleading to present sales or revenue
projections without one of the foregoing measures of income. The period that appropriately may
be covered by a projection depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances of the
company involved. For certain companies in certain industries, a projection covering a two or
three year period may be entirely reasonable. Other companies may not have a reasonable basis
for projections beyond the current year. Accordingly, management should select the period most
appropriate in the circumstances. In addition, management, in making a projection, should
disclose what, in its opinion, is the most probable specific amount or the most reasonable range
for each financial item projected based on the selected assumptions. Ranges, however, should
not be so wide as to make the disclosures meaningless. Moreover, several projections based on
varying assumptions may be judged by management to be more meaningful than a single number
or range and would be permitted.
(ii) The presentation of projected measures that are not based on historical financial
results or operational history should be clearly distinguished from projected measures that are
based on historical financial results or operational history.
(iii) It generally would be misleading to present projections that are based on historical
financial results or operational history without presenting such historical financial measure or
operational history with equal or greater prominence.
326
(iv) The presentation of projections that include non-GAAP financial measures should
include a clear definition or explanation of those financial measures, a description of the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure to which it is most closely
related, and an explanation why the non-GAAP measure was selected instead of a GAAP
measure.

(iv) Upon the consummation of a de-SPAC transaction, as defined in Item 1601(a) of
Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.1601(a)), an issuer must re-determine its status as a smaller
reporting company pursuant to the thresholds set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section prior to
its first filing, other than pursuant to Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and/or 9.01(c) of Form 8-K,
following the de-SPAC transaction and reflect this re-determination in its next periodic report.
(A) Public float is measured as of a date within four business days after the
consummation of the de-SPAC transaction and is computed by multiplying the aggregate
worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates
as of that date by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid
and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity; and
(B) Annual revenues are the annual revenues of the target company, as defined in Item
1601(d) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.1601(d)), as of the most recently completed fiscal year
reported in the Form 8-K filed pursuant to Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and/or 9.01(c) of Form 8-K.
