Governing the Consolidated Audit Trail for Purposes of Short Sale-related Data Collection
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Notice of the text of the proposed amendments to national market system plan.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is publishing notice of
the text of the proposed amendments to the National Market System Plan Governing the
Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT NMS Plan”) in connection with the Commission’s issuance of
Release No. 34-94313, the “Short Position and Short Activity Reporting by Institutional
Investment Managers” (the “Proposing Release”).
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew Sherman, Special Counsel; and
David Cohen, Attorney-Advisor, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Trading and
Markets; and Timothy M. Riley, Branch Chief; Patrice M. Pitts, Special Counsel; James R.
Curley, Special Counsel; Quinn Kane, Special Counsel; Jessica Kloss, Attorney-Advisor;
Brendan McLeod, Attorney-Advisor; and Josephine J. Tao, Assistant Director, Office of Trading
Practices, Division of Trading and Markets, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, at (202) 551-5777.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission is proposing for comment a new rule
prescribing a “buy to cover” order marking requirement under Regulation SHO (Proposed Rule
205) (17 CFR 242.205), as well as new Rule 13f-2 (Proposed Rule 13f-2) (17 CFR 240.13f-2)
and related form (Proposed Form SHO) (17 CFR 249.XXX) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Proposed Rule 13f-2 would require certain institutional investment
2
managers to report, on a monthly basis on new Proposed Form SHO, certain short position data
and short activity data for certain equity securities as prescribed in Proposed Rule 13f-2.
Proposed Rule 205 would establish a new “buy to cover” order marking requirement for certain
purchase orders effected by a broker-dealer for its own account or for the account of another
person at the broker-dealer. In the Proposing Release, the Commission is also proposing
amendments to the CAT NMS Plan that would require the reporting to the Consolidated Audit
Trail of (i) “buy to cover” order marking information and (ii) reliance on the bona fide market
making exception in Regulation SHO. This Notice is being given of the text of the proposed
amendments to the CAT NMS Plan. For a full discussion of the proposed amendments to the
CAT NMS Plan, see the Proposing Release.
To comment on the proposed amendments to the CAT NMS Plan (including the text
contained in this notice), please provide comments to the rulemaking file S7-08-22, as outlined
in the Proposing Release.
