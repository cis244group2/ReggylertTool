Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is proposing rules to
enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy,
governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, we are proposing
amendments to require current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents. We are also
proposing to require periodic disclosures about a registrant’s policies and procedures to identify
and manage cybersecurity risks, management’s role in implementing cybersecurity policies and
procedures, and the board of directors’ cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of
cybersecurity risk. Additionally, the proposed rules would require registrants to provide updates
about previously reported cybersecurity incidents in their periodic reports. Further, the proposed
rules would require the cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline eXtensible
Business Reporting Language (“Inline XBRL”). The proposed amendments are intended to
better inform investors about a registrant’s risk management, strategy, and governance and to
provide timely notification of material cybersecurity incidents.
DATES: Comments should be received on or before May 9, 2022.

Additionally, cyber criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to execute their
attacks.

With an increase in the prevalence of cybersecurity incidents, there is an increased risk of
the effect of cybersecurity incidents on the economy and registrants. Large scale cybersecurity
attacks can have systemic effects on the economy as a whole, including serious effects on critical
infrastructure and national security.12 Public companies of all sizes and operating in all
industries are susceptible to cybersecurity incidents that can stem from intentional or
unintentional acts.13 Additionally, senior management and boards of directors of public
companies have become increasingly concerned about cybersecurity threats.

chief executive officers of the largest 200 global companies rated “‘national and corporate

cybersecurity’ as the number one threat to business growth and the international economy in the
next 5 or 10 years.”15
The cost to companies and their investors of cybersecurity incidents is rising and doing so
at an increasing rate.
16 The types of costs and adverse consequences that companies may incur
or experience as a result of a cybersecurity incident include the following:
17
• Costs due to business interruption, decreases in production, and delays in product
launches;
• Payments to meet ransom and other extortion demands;
• Remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system
damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain
relationships after an attack;
• Increased cybersecurity protection costs, which may include increased insurance
premiums and the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional
personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party
experts and consultants;
• Lost revenues resulting from intellectual property theft and the unauthorized use of
proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an
attack;

16 See Cost of Data Breach Report 2021, IBM SECURITY (July 2021), available at
https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach (“The average total cost of a data breach increased by nearly 10%
year over year, the largest single year cost increase in the last seven years.”).

• Litigation and legal risks, including regulatory actions by state and federal
governmental authorities and non-U.S. authorities;
• Harm to employees and customers, violation of privacy laws, and reputational
damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and
• Damage to the company’s competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder
value.
As indicated by the examples enumerated above, the potential costs and damage that can
stem from a material cybersecurity incident are extensive. Many smaller companies have been
targets of cybersecurity attacks so severe that the companies have gone out of business as a
result.
18 These direct and indirect financial costs can negatively impact stock prices,
19 as well as
short-term and long-term shareholder value. To mitigate the potential costs and damage that can
result from a material cybersecurity incident, management and boards of directors may establish
and maintain effective risk management strategies to address cybersecurity risks.

Recent research suggests that cybersecurity is among the most critical governance-related
issues for investors, especially U.S. investors.21 Some investors have been seeking information

regarding registrants’ cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices,22 and
there is evidence that the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents can affect both a registrant’s
reputation and its share price.23 There may also be a positive correlation between a registrant’s
stock price and investments in certain cybersecurity technology.24 Thus, whether and how a
registrant is managing cybersecurity risks could impact an investor’s return on investment and
would be decision-useful information in an investor’s investment or considerations.
We believe investors would benefit from more timely and consistent disclosure about
material cybersecurity incidents, because of the potential impact that such incidents can have on
the financial performance or position of a registrant. We also believe that investors would
benefit from greater availability and comparability of disclosure by public companies across
industries regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices in
order to better assess whether and how companies are managing cybersecurity risks. The
proposal reflects these policy goals.

Specifically, in this release, we are proposing to amend Form 8-K to require current
disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents. We are also proposing to add new Item 106 of
Regulation S-K that would require a registrant to: (1) provide updated disclosure in periodic
reports about previously reported cybersecurity incidents; (2) describe its policies and
procedures, if any, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats,
including whether the registrant considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy,
financial planning, and capital allocation; and (3) require disclosure about the board’s oversight
of cybersecurity risk, management’s role in assessing and managing such risk, management’s
cybersecurity expertise, and management’s role in implementing the registrant’s cybersecurity
policies, procedures, and strategies. We also are proposing to amend Item 407 of Regulation SK to require disclosure of whether any member of the registrant’s board has expertise in
cybersecurity, and if so, the nature of such expertise.25
A. Existing Regulatory Framework and Interpretive Guidance Regarding
Cybersecurity Disclosure
Although there are no disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K or S-X that explicitly
refer to cybersecurity risks or incidents, in light of the increasing significance of cybersecurity
incidents, over the past decade the Commission and staff have issued interpretive guidance
concerning the application of existing disclosure and other requirements under the federal
securities laws to cybersecurity risks and incidents. In 2011, the Division of Corporation
Finance issued interpretive guidance (“2011 Staff Guidance”), providing the Division’s views
 25 Proposed Item 407(j) of Regulation S-K.
13
concerning operating companies’ disclosure obligations relating to cybersecurity risks and
incidents.26
In 2018, recognizing the “the frequency, magnitude and cost of cybersecurity incidents,”
and the need for investors to be informed about material cybersecurity risks and incidents in a
timely manner, the Commission issued interpretive guidance (“2018 Interpretive Release”) to
assist operating companies in determining when they may be required to disclose information
regarding cybersecurity risks and incidents under existing disclosure rules.27 The 2018
Interpretive Release reinforced and expanded upon the 2011 Staff Guidance and also addressed
the importance of cybersecurity policies and procedures, as well as the application of insider
trading prohibitions in the context of cybersecurity.
Specifically, the 2018 Interpretive Release stated that companies should consider the
materiality of cybersecurity risks and incidents when preparing the disclosure required in
registration statements under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, as well as in periodic and
current reports under the Exchange Act. The 2018 Interpretive Release identified the following
 26 See CF Disclosure Guidance: Topic No. 2- Cybersecurity (Oct. 13, 2011), available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance-topic2.htm.
27 See Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, Release No. 33-10459
(Feb. 26, 2018) No. 33-10459 (Feb. 21, 2018) [83 FR 8166], available at
https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33-10459.pdf. In 2018, the Commission also issued a Report of
Investigation pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act regarding certain cyber-related frauds perpetrated
against public companies and related internal accounting controls requirements. The report cautioned that public
companies subject to the internal accounting controls requirements of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B) should
consider cyber threats when implementing their internal accounting controls. The report is based on SEC
Enforcement Division investigations that focused on business email compromises in which perpetrators posed as
company executives or vendors and used emails to dupe company personnel into sending large sums to bank
accounts controlled by the perpetrators. See Report of Investigation Pursuant to 21(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 Regarding Certain Cyber-Related Frauds Perpetrated Against Public Companies and Related
Internal Accounting Controls Requirements, SEC Release No. 34-84429 (Oct. 16, 2018).
14
existing provisions in Regulations S-K and S-X that may require disclosure about cybersecurity
risks, governance, and incidents:28
• Item 105 of Regulation S-K (Risk Factors)29 – the 2018 Interpretive Release sets
forth issues for companies to consider in evaluating the need for cybersecurity risk
factor disclosure, including risks arising in connection with acquisitions.
• Item 303 of Regulation S-K (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations)30 – the 2018 Interpretive Release discusses how
the costs of ongoing cybersecurity efforts, the costs and other consequences of
cybersecurity incidents, and the risks of potential cybersecurity incidents, among
other matters, can inform a company’s management’s discussion and analysis. The
2018 Interpretive Release describes a wide array of potential costs that may be
associated with cybersecurity issues and incidents such as loss of intellectual property
and reputational harm.
• Item 101 of Regulation S-K (Description of Business)31 – the 2018 Interpretive
Release notes that if cybersecurity incidents or risks materially affect a company’s
products, services, relationships with customers or suppliers, or competitive
conditions, the company must provide appropriate disclosure.
 28 There are corresponding provisions in Form 20-F for foreign private issuers.
29 See also Item 3.D of Form 20-F. Please note that Risk Factors was designated as Regulation S-K Item 503 at the
time the 2018 Interpretive Release was issued.
30 See also Item 5 of Form 20-F.
31 See also Item 4.B of Form 20-F.
15
• Item 103 of Regulation S-K (Legal Proceedings) – the 2018 Interpretive Release
explains that this item may require disclosure about material pending legal
proceedings that relate to cybersecurity issues.
• Item 407 of Regulation S-K (Corporate Governance)32 – the 2018 Interpretive
Release clarifies that a company must describe how the board administers its risk
oversight function to the extent that cybersecurity risks are material to a company’s
business, including a description of the nature of the board’s role in overseeing the
management of such risks.
• Regulation S-X Financial Disclosures – the 2018 Interpretive Release notes the
Commission’s expectation that a company would design its financial reporting and
control systems to provide reasonable assurance that information about the range and
magnitude of the financial impacts of a cybersecurity incident would be incorporated
into its financial statements on a timely basis as that information becomes available.
The 2018 Interpretive Release also addresses the importance of a company’s adoption of
disclosure controls and procedures that cause the company to appropriately record, process,
summarize, and report to investors material information related to cybersecurity risks and
incidents.33 In addition, the 2018 Interpretive Release reminds companies, their directors,
officers, and other corporate insiders of the need to comply with insider trading laws in
connection with information about cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities
and breaches. The 2018 Interpretive Release further discusses disclosure obligations that
 32 This disclosure also is required by Item 7 of Schedule 14A.
33 See supra note 4, 2018 Interpretive Release at 8167 (“Crucial to a public company’s ability to make any required
disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents in the appropriate timeframe are disclosure controls and
procedures that provide an appropriate method of discerning the impact that such matters may have on the
company and its business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as a protocol to determine the
potential materiality of such risks and incidents.”).
16
companies may have under 17 CFR 243 (“Regulation FD”) in connection with cybersecurity
matters. The guidance set forth in both the 2011 Staff Guidance and the 2018 Interpretive
Release would remain in place if the Commission adopts the proposed rule amendments
described in this release.
B. Current Disclosure Practices
The majority of registrants reporting material cybersecurity incidents do so in a Form 8-
K, press release, or periodic report. Although we are unable to determine the number of material
cybersecurity incidents that either are not being disclosed or not being disclosed in a timely
manner, the staff has observed certain cybersecurity incidents that were reported in the media but
that were not disclosed in a registrant’s filings. Further, the staff in the Division of Corporation
Finance’s review of Form 8-K filings, as well as Form 10-K and Form 20-F filings, has shown
that the nature of the cybersecurity incident disclosure varies widely. In these filings, companies
provide different levels of specificity regarding the cause, scope, impact, and materiality of
cybersecurity incidents. For example, some companies provide a materiality analysis, disclose
the estimated costs of an incident, discuss their engagement of cybersecurity professionals,
and/or explain the remedial steps they have taken or are taking in response to a cybersecurity
incident, while others do not provide such disclosure or provide much less detail in their
disclosure on these topics.
The staff has also observed that, while the majority of registrants that are disclosing
cybersecurity risks appear to be providing such disclosures in the risk factor section of their
annual reports on Form 10-K, the disclosures are sometimes blended with other unrelated
disclosures, which makes it more difficult for investors to locate, interpret, and analyze the
information provided. Further, the staff has observed a divergence in these disclosures by
industry and that, smaller reporting companies generally provide less cybersecurity disclosure as
17
compared to larger registrants. One report noted a disconnect in which the industries
experiencing the most high profile cybersecurity incidents provided disclosure with the “least
amount of information.”34 While cybersecurity risks and attacks may disproportionately affect
certain industries at different times and in different ways, cybersecurity risks and threats may be
dynamic; it is foreseeable and perhaps even predictable that malicious actors will adapt their
strategies and target companies in any industry where there are perceived vulnerabilities.
Registrants’ disclosures of both material cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk
management and governance have improved since the issuance of the 2011 Staff Guidance and
the 2018 Interpretive Release.
35 Yet, current reporting may contain insufficient detail36 and the
staff has observed that such reporting is inconsistent, may not be timely, and can be difficult to
locate. We believe that investors would benefit from enhanced disclosure about registrants’
cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management and governance practices, including
if the registrant’s board of directors has expertise in cybersecurity matters, and we are proposing
rule amendments to enhance disclosure in those areas.
 34 Moody’s Investors Service, Research Announcement, “Cybersecurity disclosures vary greatly in high-risk
industries,” (Oct. 3, 2019), available at https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Cybersecurity-disclosuresvary-greatly-in-high-risk-industries--PBC_1196854.
35 Stephen Klemash and Jamie Smith, What companies are disclosing about cybersecurity risk and oversight, EY,
supra note 6 (EY researchers looked at cybersecurity-related disclosures in the proxy statements and Form 10-K
filings for the 76 “Fortune 100” companies that filed those documents from 2018 through May 31, 2020. Their
finding indicated that, “[m]any companies are enhancing their cybersecurity disclosures, with modest increases
across most of the disclosures tracked.”).
36 One report notes “the average public company’s cyber disclosure contains insufficient detail for investors looking
to evaluate its risk profile and to understand which remediation strategies, if any, it has implemented to control
for the identified risks.” NACD et al., The State of Cyber-Risk Disclosures of Public Companies at 3 (Mar.
2021) available at https://www.nacdonline.org/insights/publications.cfm?ItemNumber=71711. This same report
contends (and cites other sources that argue) that the 2018 Interpretive Release alone has not resulted in adequate
disclosures to investors. Id. at 4.

We welcome feedback and encourage interested parties to submit comments on any or all
aspects of the proposed rule amendments. When commenting, it would be most helpful if you
include the reasoning behind your position or recommendation.
II. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
A. Overview
Cybersecurity risks and incidents can impact the financial performance or position of a
company. Consistent, comparable, and decision-useful disclosures regarding a registrant’s
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices, as well as a registrant’s
response to material cybersecurity incidents, would allow investors to understand such risks and
incidents, evaluate a registrant’s risk management and governance practices regarding those
risks, and better inform their investment and voting decisions.
The proposed rules would require current and periodic reporting of material cybersecurity
incidents. Additionally, we are proposing amendments that would require periodic disclosures
about a registrant’s policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risk, including
the impact of cybersecurity risks on the registrant’s business strategy; management’s role and
expertise in implementing the registrant’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies; and
the board of directors’ oversight role, and cybersecurity expertise, if any.
Specifically, we are proposing to:
• Amend Form 8-K to add Item 1.05 to require registrants to disclose information about
a cybersecurity incident within four business days after the registrant determines that
it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident;
37
 37 Proposed Item 1.05.
19
• Amend Forms 10-Q and 10-K to require registrants to provide updated disclosure
relating to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents, as specified in proposed Item
106(d) of Regulation S-K. We also propose to amend these forms to require
disclosure, to the extent known to management, when a series of previously
undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in
the aggregate.38
• Amend Form 10-K to require disclosure specified in proposed Item 106 regarding:
o A registrant’s policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing
cybersecurity risks;39
o A registrant’s cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors’
oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks;40 and
o Management’s role, and relevant expertise, in assessing and managing
cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and
strategies.41
• Amend Item 407 of Regulation S-K to require disclosure about if any member of the
registrant’s board of directors has cybersecurity expertise.42
 38 Proposed Item 106(d) of Regulation S-K.
39 Proposed Item 106(b) of Regulation S-K.
40 Proposed Item 106(c)(1) of Regulation S-K.
41 Proposed Item 106(c)(2) of Regulation S-K.
42 Proposed Item 407(j).
20
• Amend Form 20-F to require foreign private issuers (“FPIs”)43 to provide
cybersecurity disclosures in their annual reports filed on that form that are consistent
with the disclosure that we propose to require in the domestic forms;
• Amend Form 6-K to add “cybersecurity incidents” as a reporting topic; and
• Require that the proposed disclosures be provided in Inline XBRL.
44
B. Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8-K
1. Overview of Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K
There is growing concern that material cybersecurity incidents45 are underreported46 and
that existing reporting may not be sufficiently timely.
47 We are proposing to address these
concerns by requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents in a current report
on Form 8-K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a
material cybersecurity incident.48
 43 An FPI is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government, except for an issuer that (1) has more than 50% of
its outstanding voting securities held of record by U.S. residents; and (2) any of the following: (i) a majority of
its officers or directors are citizens or residents of the U.S.; (ii) more than 50% of its assets are located in the
U.S.; or (iii) its business is principally administered in the U.S. See 17 CFR 230.405. See also 17 CFR 240.3b4(c).
44 Proposed Rule 405 of Regulation S-T.
45 See infra Section II.D.3 for a discussion on the proposed definition of “cybersecurity incident.”
46 See New Study Reveals Cybercrime May Be Widely Underreported – Even When Laws Mandate Disclosure,
ISACA Press Release (June 3, 2019), available at https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/pressreleases/2019/new-study-reveals-cybercrime-may-be-widely-underreported-even-when-laws-mandatedisclosure. See also Gerrit De Vynck, Many ransomware attacks go unreported. The FBI and Congress want to
change that. WASH. POST (July 27, 2021), available at
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/27/fbi-congress-ransomware-laws/ (quoting Eric
Goldstein, executive assistant director at Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a federal
agency created in 2018 to protect the U.S. from cyberattacks, as stating, “[w]e believe that only about a quarter
of ransomware intrusions are actually reported[.]”).
47 See also infra section III.C(1)(a).
48 As will be discussed in Section II.D, we propose to define the term “cybersecurity incident” as an unauthorized
occurrence on or conducted through a registrant’s information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of a registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein. We also
propose to define the term “information systems” as “information resources, owned or used by the registrant,
including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof,
21
Specifically, we propose to amend Form 8-K by adding new Item 1.05 that would require
a registrant to disclose the following information about a material cybersecurity incident, to the
extent the information is known at the time of the Form 8-K filing:
• When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing;
• A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident;
• Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized
purpose;
• The effect of the incident on the registrant’s operations; and
• Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.
We believe that this information would provide timely and relevant disclosure to
investors and other market participants (such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and
portfolio managers) and enable them to assess the possible effects of a material cybersecurity
incident on the registrant, including any long-term and short-term financial effects or operational
effects. While registrants should provide disclosure responsive to the enumerated items to the
extent known at the time of filing of the Form 8-K, we would not expect a registrant to publicly
disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its
cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such
detail as would impede the registrant’s response or remediation of the incident.49

organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of a registrant’s
information to maintain or support the registrant’s operations.” The definitions of “cybersecurity incident” and
“information systems” as proposed in Item 106 of Regulation S-K would also apply to such terms as used in
proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.
49 See also 2018 Interpretive Release at Section II.A.1. Any material information not known or disclosable at the
time of the Form 8-K filing would need to be updated in future periodic reports in response to proposed Item
106(d) of Regulation S-K. See discussion infra at Section II.C.1.
22
We believe that the proposed requirement to file an Item 1.05 Form 8-K within four
business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity
incident would significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well
as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures.50
We are proposing that the trigger for an Item 1.05 Form 8-K is the date on which a
registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident it has experienced is material, rather than the
date of discovery of the incident, so as to focus the Form 8-K disclosure on incidents that are
material to investors. In some cases, the date of the registrant’s materiality determination may
coincide with the date of discovery of an incident, but in other cases the materiality
determination will come after the discovery date. If we adopt the date of the materiality
determination as the Form 8-K reporting trigger, as proposed, we expect registrants to be diligent
in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible. To address any concern
that some registrants may delay making such a determination to avoid a disclosure obligation,
Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1.05 states: “a registrant shall make a materiality determination
regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the
incident.”
What constitutes “materiality” for purposes of the proposed cybersecurity incidents
disclosure would be consistent with that set out in the numerous cases addressing materiality in
 50 If a triggering determination occurs within four business days before a registrant’s filing of a Form 10-Q or Form
10-K, the Commission staff generally has not objected to the registrant satisfying its Form 8-K reporting
obligation by including the disclosure in Item 5 (Other Information) of Part II of its Form 10-Q or Item 9B
(Other Information) of its Form 10-K. See SEC Division of Corporation Finance, Exchange Act Form 8-K
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (updated Dec. 22, 2017), Question 1, available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/form8kfaq.htm.
23
the securities laws, including: TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,
51 Basic, Inc. v. Levinson,
52
and Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano.
53 Information is material if “there is a substantial
likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important”54 in making an investment
decision, or if it would have “significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made
available.”55 In articulating this materiality standard, the Supreme Court recognized that
“[d]oubts as to the critical nature” of the relevant information “will be commonplace.” But
“particularly in view of the prophylactic purpose” of the securities laws, and “the fact that the
content” of the disclosure “is within management’s control, it is appropriate that these doubts be
resolved in favor of those the statute is designed to protect,” namely investors.
56
A materiality analysis is not a mechanical exercise, nor should it be based solely on a
quantitative analysis of a cybersecurity incident. Rather, registrants would need to thoroughly
and objectively evaluate the total mix of information, taking into consideration all relevant facts
and circumstances surrounding the cybersecurity incident, including both quantitative and
qualitative factors, to determine whether the incident is material. Even if the probability of an
adverse consequence is relatively low, if the magnitude of the loss or liability is high, the
incident may still be material; materiality “depends on the significance the reasonable investor
would place on” the information.57 Thus, under the proposed rules, when a cybersecurity
incident occurs, registrants would need to carefully assess whether the incident is material in
 51 TSC Indus. v. Northway, 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976).
52 Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 232 (1988).

24
light of the specific circumstances presented by applying a well-reasoned, objective approach
from a reasonable investor’s perspective based on the total mix of information.
2. Examples of Cybersecurity Incidents that May Require Disclosure
Pursuant to Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K
The following is a non-exclusive list of examples of cybersecurity incidents58 that may, if
determined by the registrant to be material, trigger the proposed Item 1.05 disclosure
requirement:
• An unauthorized incident that has compromised the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of an information asset (data, system, or network); or violated the
registrant’s security policies or procedures. Incidents may stem from the accidental
exposure of data or from a deliberate attack to steal or alter data;
• An unauthorized incident that caused degradation, interruption, loss of control,
damage to, or loss of operational technology systems;
• An incident in which an unauthorized party accessed, or a party exceeded authorized
access, and altered, or has stolen sensitive business information, personally
identifiable information, intellectual property, or information that has resulted, or may
result, in a loss or liability for the registrant;
 58 As discussed infra in Section II.D, we propose to define cybersecurity incident as “an unauthorized occurrence on
or conducted through a registrant’s information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of a registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein.” We believe this term is
sufficiently understood and broad enough to encompass incidents that could adversely affect a registrant’s
information systems or information residing therein, such as gaining access without authorization or by
exceeding authorized access to such systems and information that could lead, for example, to the modification or
destruction of systems and information. We also propose to define information systems as “information
resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such
information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use,
sharing, dissemination, or disposition of a registrant’s information to maintain or support the registrant’s
operations.” The definitions of “cybersecurity incident” and “information systems” as proposed in Item 106 of
Regulation S-K would also apply to such terms as used in proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K. See infra note 80.
25
• An incident in which a malicious actor has offered to sell or has threatened to
publicly disclose sensitive company data; or
• An incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company
data that was stolen or altered.
3. Ongoing Investigations Regarding Cybersecurity Incidents
Proposed Item 1.05 would not provide for a reporting delay when there is an ongoing
internal or external investigation related to the cybersecurity incident. As the Commission stated
in the 2018 Interpretive Release, while an ongoing investigation might affect the specifics in the
registrant’s disclosure, “an ongoing internal or external investigation – which often can be
lengthy – would not on its own provide a basis for avoiding disclosures of a material
cybersecurity incident.”59 Additionally, any such delay provision could undermine the purpose
of proposed Item 1.05 of providing timely and consistent disclosure of cybersecurity incidents
given that investigations and resolutions of cybersecurity incidents may occur over an extended
period of time and may vary widely in timing and scope. At the same time, we recognize that a
delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the
perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents. On
balance, it is our current view that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents
for investors would justify not providing for a reporting delay.
Many states have laws that allow companies to delay providing public notice about a data
breach incident or notifying certain constituencies of such an incident if law enforcement
determines that notification will impede a civil or criminal investigation. A registrant may have
obligations to report incidents at the state or federal level (to customers, consumer credit
 59 See supra note 33, 2018 Interpretive Release.
26
reporting entities, state or federal regulators and law enforcement agencies, etc.); those
obligations are distinct from its obligations to disclose material information to its shareholders
under the federal securities laws. To the extent that proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K would
require disclosure in a situation in which a state law delay provision would excuse notification,
there is a possibility a registrant would be required to disclose the incident on Form 8-K even
though it could delay incident reporting under a particular state law. The proposed Form 8-K
requirement would advance the objective of timely reporting of material cybersecurity incidents
without the uncertainties of delay. It is critical to investor protection and well-functioning,
orderly, and efficient markets that investors promptly receive information regarding material
cybersecurity incidents.
4. Proposed Amendment to Form 6-K
FPIs are not required to file current reports on Form 8-K.60 Instead, they are required to
furnish on Form 6-K61 copies of all information that the FPI: (i) makes or is required to make
public under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) files, or is required to file under the
rules of any stock exchange, or (iii) otherwise distributes to its security holders. We are
proposing to amend General Instruction B of Form 6-K to reference material cybersecurity
incidents among the items that may trigger a current report on Form 6-K. As with proposed Item
1.05 of Form 8-K, the proposed change to Form 6-K is intended to provide timely cybersecurity
incident disclosure in a manner that is consistent with the general purpose and use of Form 6-K.
 60 See Exchange Act Rules 13a-11 and 15d-11 [17 CFR 240.13a-11 and 15d-11].
61 17 CFR 249.306.
27
5. Proposed Amendments to the Eligibility Provisions of Form S-3
and Form SF-3 and Safe Harbor Provision in Exchange Act Rules
13a-11 and 15d-11
We are proposing to amend General Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3 and General
Instruction I.A.2 of Form SF-3 to provide that an untimely filing on Form 8-K regarding new
Item 1.05 would not result in loss of Form S-3 or Form SF-3 eligibility. Under our existing
rules, the untimely filing on Form 8-K of certain specified items does not result in loss of Form
S-3 or Form SF-3 eligibility, so long as Form 8-K reporting is current at the time the Form S-3 or
SF-3 is filed. In the past, when we have adopted new disclosure requirements that differed from
the traditional periodic reporting obligations of companies, we have acknowledged concerns
about the potentially harsh consequences of the loss of Form S-3 or Form SF-3 eligibility, and
addressed such concerns by specifying that untimely filing of Forms 8-K relating to certain
topics would not result in the loss of Form S-3 or Form SF-3 eligibility.62 For the same reason,
we believe that it is appropriate to add proposed Item 1.05 to the list of Form 8-K items in
General Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3 and General Instruction I.A.2 of Form SF-3.63
We are also proposing to amend Rules 13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) under the Exchange Act
to include new Item 1.05 in the list of Form 8-K items eligible for a limited safe harbor from
liability under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act.64 In 2004, when the
Commission adopted the limited safe harbor, the Commission noted its view that the safe harbor

2000)]; see also Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of Filing Date, Release No. 33-
8400 (Mar. 16, 2004) [69 FR 15593 (Mar. 25, 2004)] (the “Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Release”).
63 See Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading, Release No. 33-7881 (Aug. 15, 2000) [65 FR 51715]; Additional
Form 8-K Disclosure Release.
64 Rules 13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) each provides that “[n]o failure to file a report on Form 8-K that is required solely
pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 5.02(e), or 6.03 of Form 8-K shall be deemed a
violation of” Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act or Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
28
is appropriate if the triggering event for the Form 8-K requires management to make a rapid
materiality determination.65 While the registrant would need to file an Item 1.05 Form 8-K
within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material
cybersecurity incident, rather than within four business days after its discovery of the incident,
we expect management to make a materiality determination about the incident as soon as
reasonably practicable after its discovery of the incident.
66 In some cases, we expect that
management would make a materiality determination coincident with discovering a
cybersecurity incident and therefore file a Form 8-K very soon after the registrant experiences or
discovers a cybersecurity incident. Therefore, we believe that it is appropriate to extend the safe
harbor to this proposed new item.
Request for Comment
1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on
Form 8-K? Does the proposed Form 8-K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the
informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants?
2. Would proposed Item 1.05 require an appropriate level of disclosure about a material
cybersecurity incident? Would the proposed disclosures allow investors to understand the
nature of the incident and its potential impact on the registrant, and make an informed
investment decision? Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in
proposed Item 1.05? Is there any additional information about a material cybersecurity
incident that Item 1.05 should require?
 65 Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Release at 69 FR 15607.
66 Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.
29
3. Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures
have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity
incidents? If so, how could we modify the proposal to avoid this effect? For example,
should registrants instead provide some of the disclosures in proposed Item 1.05 in the
registrant’s next periodic report? If so, which disclosures?
4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8-K within four business
days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident.
Would the proposed four-business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants
to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we
modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8-K under proposed Item 1.05?
If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures?
5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the
registrant’s discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant
has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information
should be disclosed in Form 8-K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead
require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a
certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the company’s assets, equity, revenues or
net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold?
6. To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8-K incident reporting obligation create
conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or
state law? How would any such conflicting obligations arise, and what mechanisms could
the Commission use to ensure that registrants can comply with other laws and regulations
30
while providing these timely disclosures to investors? What costs would registrants face in
determining the extent of a potential conflict?
7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a
cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the
Commission based on the Attorney General’s written determination that the delay is in the
interest of national security?
8. We are proposing to include an instruction that “a registrant shall make a materiality
determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after
discovery of the incident.” Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant
delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the
timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of
timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt?
9. Should certain registrants that would be within the scope of the proposed requirements, but
that are subject to other cybersecurity-related regulations, or that would be included in the
scope of the Commission’s recently-proposed cybersecurity rules67 for advisers and funds, if
adopted, be excluded from the proposed requirements? For example, should the proposed
Form 8-K reporting requirements or the other disclosure requirements described in this
 67 See Cybersecurity Risk Management for Investment Advisers, Registered Investment Companies, and Business
Development Companies, Release No. 34-94197 (Feb. 9, 2022) [87 FR 13524 (Mar. 9, 2022)] (“Investment
Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release”). In this release, the Commission proposed new rules and rule
amendments that would require: (i) registered investment advisers (“advisers”) and investment companies
(“funds”) to adopt and implement written cybersecurity policies and procedures reasonably designed to address
cybersecurity risks; (ii) advisers to report significant cybersecurity incidents affecting the adviser, or its fund or
private fund clients, to the Commission; (iii) advisers and funds to provide cyber-related disclosures to clients
and investors; and (iv) advisers and funds to maintain certain records related to the proposed cybersecurity risk
management obligations and the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents.
31
release, as applicable, exclude business development companies (“BDCs”),68 or the publicly
traded parent of an adviser?
10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an
unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrant’s “information systems,” which is
proposed to include “information resources owned or used by the registrant.” Would
registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination
about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by
them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting
information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why,
and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure
requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and
risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties?
11. We are proposing that registrants be required to file rather than permitted to furnish an Item
1.05 Form 8-K. Should we instead permit registrants to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8-K, such
that the Form 8-K would not be subject to liability under Section 18 of the Exchange Act
unless the registrant specifically states that the information is to be considered “filed” or
incorporates it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or Exchange Act?
12. We note above a non-exclusive list of examples that would merit disclosure under Item 1.05
of Form 8-K covers some, but not all, types of material cybersecurity incidents. Are there
additional examples we should address? Should we include a non-exclusive list of examples
in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K?
 68 For purposes of this release, the terms “public companies,” “companies,” and “registrants,” include issuers that
are business development companies as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(“Investment Company Act”), but not those investment companies registered under that Act.
32
13. Should we include Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-11 and 15d-11 safe harbors
from public and private claims under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 for failure
to timely file a Form 8-K, as proposed?
14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8-K items where failure to
timely file a Form 8-K will not result in the loss of a registrant’s eligibility to file a
registration statement on Form S-3 and Form SF-3?
C. Disclosure about Cybersecurity Incidents in Periodic Reports
1. Updates to Previously Filed Form 8-K Disclosure
Proposed Item 106(d)(1) of Regulation S-K would require registrants to disclose any
material changes, additions, or updates to information required to be disclosed pursuant to Item
1.05 of Form 8-K in the registrant’s quarterly report filed with the Commission on Form 10-Q or
annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10-K for the period (the registrant’s fourth
fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) in which the material change, addition, or update
occurred.
We are proposing this requirement to balance the need for prompt and timely disclosure
regarding material cybersecurity incidents with the fact that a registrant may not have complete
information about a material cybersecurity incident at the time it determines the incident to be
material. Proposed Item 106(d)(1) provides a means for investors to receive regular updates
regarding the previously reported incident when and for so long as there are material changes,
additions, or updates during a given reporting period. For example, after filing the initial Form
8-K disclosure, the registrant may become aware of additional material information about the
scope of the incident and whether any data was stolen or altered; the proposed Item 106(d)(1)
disclosure requirements would allow investors to stay informed of such developments.
33
The registrant also may be able to provide information about the effect of the previously
reported cybersecurity incident on its operations as well as a description of remedial steps it has
taken, or plans to take, in response to the incident that was not available at the time of the initial
Form 8-K filing.69 In order to assist registrants in developing updated incident disclosure in its
periodic reports, proposed Item 106(d)(1) provides the following non-exclusive examples of the
type of disclosure that should be provided, if applicable:
• Any material impact of the incident on the registrant’s operations and financial
condition;
• Any potential material future impacts on the registrant’s operations and financial
condition;
• Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident; and
• Any changes in the registrant’s policies and procedures as a result of the
cybersecurity incident, and how the incident may have informed such changes.
2. Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents that Have Become Material
in the Aggregate
Proposed Item 106(d)(2) would require disclosure when a series of previously
undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate.
Thus, registrants would need to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality, both
individually and in the aggregate. If such incidents become material in the aggregate, registrants
would need to disclose: when the incidents were discovered and whether they are ongoing; a
brief description of the nature and scope of such incidents; whether any data was stolen or
 69 Notwithstanding proposed Item 106(d)(1), there may be situations where a registrant would need to file an
amended Form 8-K to correct disclosure from the initial Item 1.05 Form 8-K, such as where that disclosure
becomes inaccurate or materially misleading as a result of subsequent developments regarding the incident. For
example, if the impact of the incident is determined after the initial Item 1.05 Form 8-K filing to be significantly
more severe than previously disclosed, an amended Form 8-K may be required.
34
altered; the impact of such incidents on the registrant’s operations and the registrant’s actions;
and whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incidents.
While such incidents conceptually could take a variety of forms, an example would be
where one malicious actor engages in a number of smaller but continuous cyber-attacks related
in time and form against the same company and collectively, they are either quantitatively or
qualitatively material, or both. Such incidents would need to be disclosed in the periodic report
for the period in which a registrant has made a determination that they are material in the
aggregate.
Request for Comment
15. Should we require registrants to disclose any material changes or updates to information that
would be disclosed pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K in the registrant’s quarterly
or annual report, as proposed? Are there instances, other than to correct inaccurate or
materially misleading prior disclosures, when a registrant should be required to update its
report on Form 8-K or file another Form 8-K instead of providing disclosure of material
changes, additions, or updates in a subsequent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K?
16. Should we require a registrant to provide disclosure on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K when a
series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes
material in the aggregate, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a registrant to
provide disclosure in Form 8-K, rather than in a periodic report, as proposed, when a series
of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes
material in the aggregate?
35
D. Disclosure of a Registrant’s Risk Management, Strategy and Governance
Regarding Cybersecurity Risks
1. Risk Management and Strategy
Companies typically address significant risks to their businesses by developing risk
management systems, which may include policies and procedures for identifying, assessing, and
managing the risks. These policies and procedures may then be subject to oversight by a
company’s management and board.
70 Policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
oversight, risk assessments, and incident responses may be adopted to help prevent or mitigate
cyber-attacks and potentially prevent future attacks. Staff in the Division of Corporation Finance
has observed that most of the registrants that disclosed a cybersecurity incident in 2021 did not
describe their cybersecurity risk oversight and related policies and procedures. Some of these
registrants provided only general disclosures, such as a reference to cybersecurity as one of the
risks overseen by the board or a board committee.
We are proposing Item 106(b) of Regulation S-K to require registrants to provide more
consistent and informative disclosure regarding their cybersecurity risk management and
strategy. We believe that disclosure of the relevant policies and procedures, to the extent a
registrant has established any, would benefit investors by providing greater transparency as to the
registrant’s strategies and actions to manage cybersecurity risks. For example, proposed
disclosure about whether the registrant has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and
undertakes activities designed to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents
 70 See Martin Lipton, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Spotlight on Boards 2018, HARV. L. SCH. F. ON CORP.
GOVERNANCE (May 31, 2018), available at https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/05/31/spotlight-on-boards2018 (one of the board’s responsibilities is to, “[o]versee and understand the corporation’s risk management and
compliance efforts and how risk is taken into account in the corporation’s business decision-making; respond to
red flags if and when they arise.”).
36
can improve an investor’s understanding of the registrant’s cybersecurity risk profile. Given that
a significant number of cybersecurity incidents pertain to third party service providers, the
proposed rules would require disclosure concerning a registrant’s selection and oversight of
third-party entities as well.71
Additionally, cybersecurity risks may have an impact on a registrant’s business strategy,
financial outlook, or financial planning. Across industries, companies increasingly rely on
information technology, collection of data, and use of digital payments as critical components of
their business model and strategy. Their exposure to cybersecurity risks and previous
cybersecurity incidents may affect these critical components, informing changes in their business
model, financial condition, financial planning, and allocation of capital. For example, a
company with a business model that relies highly on collecting and safeguarding sensitive and
personally identifiable information from its customers may consider raising additional capital to
invest in enhanced cybersecurity protection, improvements in its information security
infrastructure, or employee cybersecurity training. Another company may examine the risks and
decide that its business model should be adapted to minimize its collection of sensitive and
personally identifiable information in order to reduce its risk exposure. These strategic decisions
have implications for the company’s financial planning and future financial performance.
Disclosure about the impact of cybersecurity risks on business strategy would enable investors to
assess whether companies will become more resilient or conversely, more vulnerable to
cybersecurity risks in the future.
 71 See Stephen Klemash and Jamie Smith, What companies are disclosing about cybersecurity risk and oversight,
EY, supra note 6 (“Around a third of the disclosed data breaches related to cyber attacks of third-party service
providers.”).
37
We also propose requiring disclosure of whether cybersecurity related risk and previous
incidents have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant’s results of operations or
financial condition. Investors would likely want to understand the financial impacts of
cybersecurity risks and previous cybersecurity incidents in order to understand how these risks
and incidents affect the company’s financial performance or position, and thus the return on their
investment. For example, a company that has previously experienced a cybersecurity incident
may plan to provide compensation to consumers or it may anticipate regulatory fines or legal
judgments as a result of the incident. These financial impacts would help investors understand
the degree to which cybersecurity risks and incidents could affect the company’s financial
performance or position.
Proposed Item 106(b) would therefore require registrants to disclose its policies and
procedures, if it has any, to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats, including:
operational risk; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers;
violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risk. Specifically,
proposed Item 106(b) of Regulation S-K would require disclosure, as applicable, of whether:72
• The registrant has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and if so, provide a
description of such program;
• The registrant engages assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in
connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program;
• The registrant has policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity
risks associated with its use of any third-party service provider (including, but not
limited to, those providers that have access to the registrant’s customer and employee
 72 See proposed Item 106(b).
38
data), including whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect the selection
and oversight of these providers and contractual and other mechanisms the company
uses to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to these providers;
• The registrant undertakes activities to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of
cybersecurity incidents;
• The registrant has business continuity, contingency, and recovery plans in the event
of a cybersecurity incident;
• Previous cybersecurity incidents have informed changes in the registrant’s
governance, policies and procedures, or technologies;
• Cybersecurity related risk and incidents have affected or are reasonably likely to
affect the registrant’s results of operations or financial condition and if so, how; and
• Cybersecurity risks are considered as part of the registrant’s business strategy,
financial planning, and capital allocation and if so, how.
2. Governance
Disclosure regarding board oversight of a registrant’s cybersecurity risk and the inclusion
or exclusion of management from the oversight of cybersecurity risks and the implementation of
related policies, procedures, and strategies impacts an investor’s ability to understand how a
registrant prepares for, prevents, or responds to cybersecurity incidents.73 Accordingly,
proposed Item 106(c) would require disclosure of a registrant’s cybersecurity governance,
including the board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk and a description of management’s role in
 73 See John F. Saverese et al., Cybersecurity Oversight and Defense – A Board and Management Imperative, HARV.
L.SCH. F. ON CORP. GOVERNANCE (May 14, 2021), available at
https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/05/14/cybersecurity-oversight-and-defense-a-board-and-managementimperative/.
39
assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, the relevant expertise of such management, and its
role in implementing the registrant’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies.74
Specifically, as it pertains to the board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk, disclosure
required by proposed Item 106(c)(1) would include a discussion, as applicable, of the
following:
75
• Whether the entire board, specific board members or a board committee is
responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks;
• The processes by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks, and the
frequency of its discussions on this topic; and
• Whether and how the board or board committee considers cybersecurity risks as part
of its business strategy, risk management, and financial oversight.
This proposed disclosure about the board’s oversight would inform investors about the
role of the board in cybersecurity risk management, which may help inform their investment and
voting decisions. Proposed Item 106(c)(1) would also reinforce the 2018 Interpretive Release,
which states that the board’s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks should be disclosed if
“cybersecurity risks are material to a company’s business” and that such disclosures should
address how a board “engages with management on cybersecurity issues” and “discharg[es] its
[cybersecurity] risk oversight responsibility.”76
 74 Proposed amendments to Form 10-K clarify that an asset-backed issuer (as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation
AB) that does not have any executive officers or directors may omit the information required by 17 CFR
229.106(c) (Item 106(c) of Regulation S-K).
75 See proposed Item 106(c)(1). In the case of a FPI with a two-tier board of directors, proposed Instruction 1 to
Item 106(c) clarifies that the term “board of directors” means the supervisory or non-management board. In the
case of a FPI meeting the requirements of 17 CFR 240.10A-3(c)(3), for purposes of proposed Item 106(c), the
term, “board of directors” means the registrant’s board of auditors (or similar body) or statutory auditors, as
applicable.
76 See 2018 Interpretive Release.
40
Proposed Item 106(c)(2) would require a description of management’s role in assessing
and managing cybersecurity-related risks and in implementing the registrant’s cybersecurity
policies, procedures, and strategies. This description would include, but not be limited to, the
following information:77
• Whether certain management positions or committees are responsible for measuring
and managing cybersecurity risk, specifically the prevention, mitigation, detection,
and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and the relevant expertise of such persons
or members;
• Whether the registrant has a designated chief information security officer,
78 or
someone in a comparable position, and if so, to whom that individual reports within
the registrant’s organizational chart, and the relevant expertise79 of any such persons;
• The processes by which such persons or committees are informed about and monitor
the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents; and
• Whether and how frequently such persons or committees report to the board of
directors or a committee of the board of directors on cybersecurity risk.
This proposed disclosure of how a registrant’s management assesses and implements
policies, procedures, and strategies to mitigate cybersecurity risks would be of importance to
 77 See proposed Item 106(c)(2).
78 The chief information security officer may be responsible for identifying and monitoring cybersecurity risks,
communicating with senior management and the registrant’s business units about acceptable risk levels,
developing risk mitigation strategies, and implementing a security framework that protects the registrant’s digital
assets. The Role of the CISO and the Digital Security Landscape, ISACA J. VOL. 2, at 22, 23-29 (2019) available
at https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2019/volume-2/the-role-of-the-ciso-and-the-digitalsecurity-landscape.
79 Proposed Instruction 2 to Item 106(c) provides guidance that “expertise” in Item 106(c)(2)(i) and (ii) may
include, for example: prior work experience in cybersecurity; any relevant degrees or certifications; any
knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity.
41
investors both as they understand how registrants are planning for cybersecurity risks and as they
make decisions as to how best to allocate their capital.
3. Definitions
Proposed Item 106(a) defines the terms “cybersecurity incident,” “cybersecurity threat,”
and “information systems,” as used in proposed Item 106 and proposed Form 8-K Item 1.05 as
follows:80
• Cybersecurity incident means an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a
registrant’s information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of a registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein.
• Cybersecurity threat means any potential occurrence that may result in, an
unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a
registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein.
• Information systems means information resources, owned or used by the registrant,
including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources,
or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use,
sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrant’s information to maintain or
support the registrant’s operations.
 80 See proposed Item 106(a). These three terms are derived from a number of established sources. See Presidential
Policy Directive -- United States Cyber Incident Coordination (July 26, 2016) (“PPD-41”); 6 U.S.C. 1501
(2021); 44 U.S.C. 3502 (2021); 44 U.S.C. 3552 (2021); see also National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), Computer Security Resource Center Glossary (last visited Feb. 6, 2022), available at
https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary (“NIST Glossary”). The proposed definitions also are consistent with proposed
definitions in the Investment Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release. See Investment Management
Cybersecurity Proposing Release at notes 27, 28, and 30. We believe the proposed terms are sufficiently precise
for registrants to understand and use in connection with the proposed rules. Use of common terms is intended to
facilitate compliance and reduce regulatory burdens. Using common terms and similar definitions with the
Investment Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release along with other federal cybersecurity rulemakings is
intended to facilitate compliance and reduce regulatory burdens.
42
What constitutes a “cybersecurity incident” for purposes of our proposal should be
construed broadly and may result from any one or more of the following: an accidental exposure
of data, a deliberate action or activity to gain unauthorized access to systems or to steal or alter
data, or other system compromises or data breaches.81
Request for Comment
17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrant’s
cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed
under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance?
Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements?
18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms “cybersecurity incident,” “cybersecurity threat,”
and “information systems,” in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there
other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define?
19. The proposed rule does not define “cybersecurity.” We could define the term to mean, for
example: “any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any
cybersecurity threat or any potential cybersecurity threat.” Would defining “cybersecurity”
in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? Why or why not? If defining this term would be
helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is there another definition that would
better define “cybersecurity”?
20. Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant,
auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external
third-party service provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors?
 81 See supra Section II.B.2, for examples of cybersecurity incidents that may require disclosure pursuant to
proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.
43
21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures
would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have
to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures?
22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential
effect of undermining a registrant’s cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially
adverse effects by highlighting a registrant’s lack of policies and procedures related to
cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need
for a sufficient description of a registrant’s policies and procedures for purposes of their
investment decisions?
23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller
reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why?
How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the
cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure
requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how?
24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item
106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging
growth companies, FPIs, or asset-backed securities issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which
would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures
for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in
annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration
statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act?
25. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlap with disclosure required
under Item 407(h) of Regulation S-K (“Board leadership structure and role in oversight”)
44
with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks? To the extent there is significant
overlap, should we expressly provide for the use of hyperlinks or cross-references in Item
106? Are there other approaches that would effectively decrease duplicative disclosure
without being cumbersome for investors?
E. Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors’ Cybersecurity Expertise
Cybersecurity is already among the top priorities of many boards of directors82 and
cybersecurity incidents and other risks are considered one of the largest threats to companies.
83
Accordingly, investors may find disclosure of whether any board members have cybersecurity
expertise to be important as they consider their investment in the registrant as well as their votes
on the election of directors of the registrant.
We propose to amend Item 407 of Regulation S-K by adding paragraph (j) to require
disclosure about the cybersecurity expertise of members of the board of directors of the
registrant, if any. If any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would
have to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s), and provide such detail as necessary to fully
describe the nature of the expertise.84
The proposed requirements would build upon the existing disclosure requirements in
Item 401(e) of Regulation S-K (business experience of directors) and Item 407(h) of Regulation
 82 NACD, 2019-2020 NACD Public Company Governance Survey, available at
https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-2020-Public-Company-Survey.pdf.
83 See id.
84 Consistent with proposed Instruction 1 to Item 106(c), we are proposing an instruction to Item 407(j) to clarify
that in the case of a FPI with a two-tier board of directors the term “board of directors” means the supervisory or
non-management board. In the case of a FPI meeting the requirements of 17 CFR 240.10A-3(c)(3), for purposes
of 407(j), the term, “board of directors” means the registrant’s board of auditors (or similar body) or statutory
auditors, as applicable. See proposed Instruction 2 to Item 407(j). Likewise, proposed General Instruction J to
Form 10-K permits an asset-backed issuer that does not have any executive officers or directors to omit the Item
407 disclosure required by Form 10-K as these entities are generally passive pools of assets and are subject to
substantially different reporting requirements than operating companies. Similarly, such entities would be
permitted to omit the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure from Form 10-K under General Instruction J for the same
reason.
45
S-K (board risk oversight). The proposed Item 407(j) disclosure would be required in a
registrant’s proxy or information statement when action is to be taken with respect to the election
of directors, and in its Form 10-K.
Proposed Item 407(j) would not define what constitutes “cybersecurity expertise,” given
that such expertise may cover different experiences, skills, and tasks. Proposed Item 407(j)(1)(ii)
does, however, include the following non-exclusive list of criteria that a registrant should
consider in reaching a determination on whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity:
• Whether the director has prior work experience in cybersecurity, including, for
example, prior experience as an information security officer, security policy analyst,
security auditor, security architect or engineer, security operations or incident
response manager, or business continuity planner;
• Whether the director has obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity; and
• Whether the director has knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity,
including, for example, in the areas of security policy and governance, risk
management, security assessment, control evaluation, security architecture and
engineering, security operations, incident handling, or business continuity planning.
Proposed Item 407(j)(2) would state that a person who is determined to have expertise in
cybersecurity will not be deemed an expert for any purpose, including, without limitation, for
purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k),
85 as a result of being designated or
identified as a director with expertise in cybersecurity pursuant to proposed Item 407(j).
86 This
proposed safe harbor is intended to clarify that Item 407(j) would not impose on such person any
 85 15 U.S.C. 77k.
86 See proposed Item 407(j)(3)(i).
46
duties, obligations, or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liability imposed
on such person as a member of the board of directors in the absence of such designation or
identification.87 This provision should alleviate such concerns for cybersecurity experts
considering board service. Conversely, we do not intend for the identification of a cybersecurity
expert on the board to decrease the duties and obligations or liability of other board members.88
Request for Comment
26. Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful?
Should it be modified in any way?
27. Should we require disclosure of the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the
board of directors, as currently proposed in Item 407(j)(1)? Would a requirement to name
such persons have the unintended effect of deterring persons with this expertise from serving
on a board of directors?
28. When a registrant does not have a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of
directors, should the registrant be required to state expressly that this is the case under
proposed Item 407(j)(1)? As proposed, we would not require a registrant to make such an
explicit statement.
29. Proposed Item 407(j) would require registrants to describe fully the nature of a board
member’s expertise in cybersecurity without mandating specific disclosures. Is there
particular information that we should instead require a registrant to disclose with respect to a
board member’s expertise in cybersecurity?
 87 See proposed Item 407(j)(3)(ii).
88 See proposed Item 407(j)(3)(iii).
47
30. As proposed, Item 407(j)(1) includes a non-exclusive list of criteria that a company should
consider in determining whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity. Are these factors
for registrants to consider useful in determining cybersecurity expertise? Should the list be
revised, eliminated, or supplemented?
31. Would the Item 407(j) disclosure requirements have the unintended effect of undermining a
registrant’s cybersecurity defense efforts or otherwise impose undue burdens on registrants?
If so, how?
32. Should 407(j) disclosure of board expertise be required in an annual report and proxy or
information statement, as proposed?
33. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 407(j) overlap with disclosure required
under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to the business experience of directors?
Are there alternative approaches that would avoid duplicative disclosure without being
cumbersome for investors?
34. As proposed, Item 407(j) does not include a definition of the term “expertise” in the context
of cybersecurity? Should Item 407(j) define the term “expertise”? If so, how should we
define the term?
35. Should certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging
growth companies, or FPIs, be excluded from the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure
requirement? How would any exclusion affect the ability of investors to assess the
cybersecurity risk of a registrant or compare such risk among registrants?
36. Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identified
as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the
48
federal securities laws as a result of such identification? Are there alternatives we should
consider?
37. As proposed, disclosure under Item 407(j) would be required in a proxy or information
statement. Should we require the disclosure under Item 407(j) to appear in a registrant’s
proxy or information statement regardless of whether the registrant is relying on General
Instruction G(3)? Is this information relevant to a security holder’s decision to vote for a
particular director?
F. Periodic Disclosure by Foreign Private Issuers
We propose to amend Form 20-F to add Item 16J that would require an FPI to include
in its annual report on Form 20-F the same type of disclosure that we propose in Items 106 and
407(j) of Regulation S-K and that would be required in periodic reports filed by domestic
registrants. One difference is that while domestic registrants would be required to include the
proposed Item 407(j) disclosure about board expertise in both their annual reports and proxy or
information statements, FPIs are not subject to Commission rules for proxy or information
statement filings and thus, would only be required to include this disclosure in their annual
reports.89
With respect to incident disclosure, where an FPI has previously reported an incident on
Form 6-K, the proposed amendments would require an update regarding such incidents,
consistent with proposed Item 106(d)(1) of Regulation S-K.90 We are also proposing to amend
Form 20-F to require FPIs to disclose on an annual basis information regarding any previously
undisclosed material cybersecurity incidents that have occurred during the reporting period,
 89 Exchange Act Rule 3a12-3(b) [17 CFR 240.3a12-3(b)].
90 See proposed Item 16J(d)(1).
49
including a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents that
has become material in the aggregate.91
The Commission created Form 40-F in connection with its establishment of a
multijurisdictional disclosure system (“MJDS”). This system generally permits eligible
Canadian FPIs to use Canadian disclosure standards and documents to satisfy the Commission’s
registration and disclosure requirements. Accordingly, we are not proposing prescriptive
cybersecurity disclosure requirements for Form 40-F filers.
Request for Comment
38. Should we amend Form 20-F, as proposed to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk
management and strategy, governance, and incidents? Additionally, should we amend Form
6-K, as proposed, to add “cybersecurity incidents” as a reporting topic? Are there unique
considerations with respect to FPIs in these contexts?
39. We are not proposing any changes to Form 40-F. Should we instead require an MJDS issuer
filing an annual report on Form 40-F to comply with the Commission’s specific proposed
cybersecurity-related disclosure requirements in the same manner as Form 10-K or Form 20-
F filers?
G. Structured Data Requirements
We are proposing to require registrants to tag the information specified by Item 1.05 of
Form 8-K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S-K in Inline XBRL in accordance with Rule
405 of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.405) and the EDGAR Filer Manual.92 The proposed
 91 See proposed Item 16J(d)(2).
92 This tagging requirement would be implemented by including a cross-reference to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T in
proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8-K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S-K, and by revising Rule 405(b) of
Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.405(b)] to include the listed disclosure Items. In conjunction with the EDGAR
Filer Manual, Regulation S-T governs the electronic submission of documents filed with the Commission. Rule
50
requirements would include block text tagging of narrative disclosures, as well as detail tagging
of quantitative amounts disclosed within the narrative disclosures. Inline XBRL is both
machine-readable and human-readable, which improves the quality and usability of XBRL data
for investors.93
Requiring Inline XBRL tagging of the disclosures provided pursuant to these disclosure
items would benefit investors by making the disclosures more readily available and easily
accessible to investors, market participants, and others for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and
other analysis, as compared to requiring a non-machine readable data language such as ASCII or
HTML. This Inline XBRL tagging would enable automated extraction and analysis of the
granular data required by the proposed rules, allowing investors and other market participants to
more efficiently perform large-scale analysis and comparison of this information across
registrants and time periods. For narrative disclosures, an Inline XBRL requirement would allow
investors to extract and search for disclosures about cybersecurity incidents reported on Form 8-
K, updated information about cybersecurity incidents reported in a registrant’s periodic reports, a
registrant’s cybersecurity policies and procedures, management’s role in assessing and managing
cybersecurity risks, and the board of directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risk and cybersecurity
expertise rather than having to manually run searches for these disclosures through entire
documents. The Inline XBRL requirement would also enable automatic comparison of these
disclosures against prior periods, and targeted artificial intelligence/machine learning

405 of Regulation S-T specifically governs the scope and manner of disclosure tagging requirements for
operating companies and investment companies, including the requirement in Rule 405(a)(3) to use Inline XBRL
as the specific structured data language to use for tagging the disclosures.
93 See Inline XBRL Filing of Tagged Data, Securities Act Release No. 10514 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 40846 (Aug.
16, 2018)]. Inline XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL data directly into an HTML document, eliminating the
need to tag a copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit. Inline XBRL is both human-readable and
machine-readable for purposes of validation, aggregation, and analysis. Id. at 40851.
51
assessments of specific narrative disclosures rather than the entire unstructured document. At the
same time, we do not expect the incremental compliance burden associated with tagging the
proposed additional information to be unduly burdensome because registrants subject to the
proposed tagging requirements are for the most part subject to similar Inline XBRL requirements
in other Commission filings.
Request for Comment
40. Should we require registrants to tag the disclosures required by proposed Item 1.05 of Form
8-K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S-K in Inline XBRL, as proposed? Are there
any changes we should make to ensure accurate and consistent tagging? If so, what changes
should we make? Should we require registrants to use a different structured data language to
tag these disclosures? If so, what structured data language should we require? Are there any
registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs that
we should exempt from the tagging requirement?
GENERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENT
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding the
proposed rule amendments, specific issues discussed in this release, and other matters that may
have an effect on the proposed rule amendments. With regard to any comments, we note that
such comments are of particular assistance to our rulemaking initiative if accompanied by
supporting data and analysis of the issues addressed in those comments.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
Cybersecurity threats and incidents continue to increase in prevalence and seriousness,
posing an ongoing and escalating risk to public companies, investors, and other market
52
participants.
94 The number of reported breaches disclosed by public companies has increased
over the last decade, from 28 in 2011 to 144 in 2019 and 117 in 2020.95 Although estimating the
total cost of cybersecurity incidents is difficult, as many events may be unreported, some
estimates put the total costs in the trillions of dollars per year in the U.S. alone.96 The Council of
Economic Advisers estimated that in 2016 the total cost of cybersecurity incidents was between
$57 billion and $109 billion, or between 0.31 and 0.58 percent of U.S. GDP in that year.
97
As described earlier, while cybersecurity incident disclosure has become more frequent
since the issuance of the 2011 Staff Guidance and 2018 Interpretive Release, there is concern
that material cybersecurity incidents are underreported.98 For instance, the staff has observed
that certain cybersecurity incidents were reported in the media but not disclosed in a registrant’s
filings.99 Even when disclosures about cybersecurity breaches are made, they may not be timely.
According to Audit Analytics data, in 2020, it took on average 44 days for companies to discover
breaches, and then in addition, it took an average of 53 days and a median of 37 days for
companies to disclose a breach after its discovery.100 Additionally, incident disclosure practices
 94 Unless otherwise noted, when we discuss the economic effects of the proposed amendments on “other market
participants,” we mean those market participants that typically provide services for investors and who rely on the
information in registrant’s filings (such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and portfolio managers).
95 Audit Analytics, Trends in Cybersecurity Breaches (Mar. 2021) (stating that: “[c]ybersecurity breaches can
result in a litany of costs, such as investigations, legal fees, and remediation. There is also the risk of economic
costs that directly impact financial performance, such as a reduction in revenue due to lost sales.”).
96 See Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Cost of a Cyber Incident: Systemic Review and CrossValidation (Oct. 26, 2020), available at https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISAOCE_Cost_of_Cyber_Incidents_Study-FINAL_508.pdf.
97 See supra note 12, The Council of Economic Advisers, The Cost of Malicious Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy
(Feb. 2018).
98 See supra section II.B and note 46. See also infra note 146, Amir et al. (2018) (providing evidence that
companies underreport cyber-attacks).

100 See supra note 95 (“Audit Analytics”).
53
currently vary widely across registrants––some registrants disclose incidents through Form 8-K
and some may disclose on a company website or in a press release. Because cybersecurity
incidents can significantly impact companies’ stock prices, delayed reporting results in
mispricing of registrants’ securities, harming investors.101 Therefore, more timely and
informative disclosure of a cybersecurity incident is needed for investors to assess an incident’s
impact and a registrant’s ability to respond to the incident and to make more informed decisions.
Investors also need to better understand the growing cybersecurity risks registrants are
facing and their ability to manage such risks in order to better value their securities. Executives,
boards of directors, and investors are focused on this emerging risk. A 2019 survey of CEOs,
boards of directors, and institutional investors found that they identified cybersecurity as the top
global challenge for CEOs.102 In 2021, a survey of audit committee members identified
cybersecurity as the second highest risk that their audit committee would focus on in 2022,
second only to financial reporting and internal controls.103
Disclosures about cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance are
increasing, although they are not currently provided by all registrants. An analysis of disclosures
by Fortune 100 companies found that disclosures of cybersecurity risk in proxy statements were
found in 89 percent of filings in 2020, up from 79 percent in 2018, and disclosures of efforts to
 101 See infra note 133.
102 See supra note 15, EY CEO Imperative Study (2019). The Ernst & Young survey consisted of interviewing 200
global CEOs amongst the Forbes Global 2000 and Forbes largest private companies as well as interviewing 100
senior investors from global firms that had managed at least $100 billion in assets.

54
mitigate cybersecurity risk were found in 92 percent of proxy statements or 10-K Forms, up from
83 percent in 2018.
104
As with incident reporting, there is a lack of uniformity in current reporting practice for
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure.105 The relevant disclosures
currently are made in varying sections of a registrant’s periodic and current reports, such as in
risk factors, in management’s discussion and analysis, in a description of business and legal
proceedings, or in financial statement disclosures, and are sometimes blended with other
unrelated disclosures. The varied disclosure about both cybersecurity incidents and
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance makes it difficult for investors and
other market participants to understand the cybersecurity risks that companies face and their
preparedness for an attack, and to make comparisons across registrants.
To provide investors and other market participants with more timely, informative,
and consistent disclosure about cybersecurity incidents, and cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance, we are proposing the following amendments.106
Regarding incident reporting, we propose to: (1) amend Form 8-K to add Item 1.05 to
require registrants to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within four
business days following the registrant’s determination that such an incident is material to
the registrant; and (2) add new Item 106(d) of Regulation S-K to require registrants to
provide updated disclosure in its periodic reports relating to previously disclosed incidents;
 104 See Jamie Smith, How Cybersecurity Risk Disclosures and Oversight are Evolving in 2021, EY CENTER FOR
BOARD MATTERS (Oct. 5, 2021), available at https://www.ey.com/en_us/board-matters/cybersecurity-riskdisclosures-and-oversight.
105 See supra section I.
106 See supra section II.
55
and (3) amend Form 20-F and Form 6-K to require FPIs to provide cybersecurity
disclosures consistent with the disclosure that we propose to require in the domestic forms.
For disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance,
we are proposing the following. First, we propose to amend Regulation S-K to require
disclosure specified in proposed new Item 106(b) and (c) regarding: (1) a registrant’s
policies and procedures if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, (2) a
registrant’s cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors’ oversight role
regarding cybersecurity-related issues, and (3) management’s role and expertise in
assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and implementing related policies, procedures
and strategies. Second, we propose to amend Item 407 of Regulation S-K to require
disclosure about cybersecurity expertise of any member of the board.
The discussion below addresses the potential economic effects of the proposed
amendments, including the likely benefits and costs, as well as the likely effects on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation.107 At the outset, we note that, where possible, we have
attempted to quantify the benefits, costs, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation expected to result from the proposed amendments. In many cases, however, we are
unable to quantify the potential economic effects because we lack information necessary to
provide a reasonable estimate. Where we are unable to quantify the economic effects of the
proposed amendments, we provide a qualitative assessment of the potential effects and
 107 Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(f)]
directs the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an
action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors,
whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)) requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to
consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any
rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange
Act.
56
encourage commenters to provide data and information that would help quantify the benefits,
costs, and the potential impacts of the proposed amendments on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation.
B. Economic Baseline
1. Current Regulatory Framework
To assess the economic impact of the proposed rules, the Commission is using as its
baseline the existing regulatory framework for cybersecurity disclosure. As discussed in Section
I, although a number of rules and regulations impose an obligation on companies to disclose
cybersecurity risks and incidents in certain circumstances, the Commission’s regulations
currently do not explicitly address cybersecurity.
In 2011, the Division of Corporation Finance issued interpretive guidance providing the
Division’s views concerning operating companies’ disclosure obligations relating to
cybersecurity risks and incidents.108 The 2011 Staff Guidance provided an overview of existing
specific disclosure obligations that may require a discussion of cybersecurity risks and
cybersecurity incidents, along with examples of potential disclosures.
109 Building on the 2011
Staff Guidance, the Commission issued the 2018 Interpretive Release to assist operating
companies in preparing disclosure about cybersecurity risks and incidents under existing
disclosure rules.110 In the 2018 Interpretive Release, the Commission instructed companies to
provide timely and ongoing information in periodic reports (Form 10-Q, Form 10-K, and Form
20-F) about material cybersecurity risks and incidents that trigger disclosure obligations.
Additionally, the 2018 Interpretive Release encouraged companies to continue to use current
 108 See supra section I.A and note 26.
109 Id.
110 See supra section I.A and note 27.
57
reports (Form 8-K or Form 6-K) to disclose material information promptly, including disclosure
pertaining to cybersecurity matters. Further, the 2018 Interpretive Release noted that to the
extent cybersecurity risks are material to a company’s business, the Commission believes that the
required disclosure of the company’s risk oversight should include the nature of the board’s role
in overseeing the management of that cybersecurity risk. The 2018 Interpretive Release also
stated that a company’s controls and procedures should enable them to, among other things,
identify cybersecurity risks and incidents and make timely disclosures regarding such risks and
incidents. Finally, the 2018 Interpretive Release highlighted the importance of insider trading
prohibitions and the need to refrain from making selective disclosures of cybersecurity risks or
incidents.
Companies currently may also be subject to other cybersecurity incident disclosure
requirements adopted by various industry regulators and contractual counterparties. For
example, federal contractors may be required to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and
breaches or face liability under the False Claims Act.111 The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires covered entities and their business associates to provide
notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.
112 Similar rules
require vendors of personal health records and related entities to report data breaches to affected
individuals and the Federal Trade Commission.113 All 50 states have data breach laws that
 111 See Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Justice News: Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco
Announces New Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative, (Oct. 6, 2021), available at
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-new-civil-cyber-fraudinitiative; see, e.g., FAR 52.239-1 (requiring contractors to “immediately” notify the federal government if they
become aware of “new or unanticipated threats or hazards . . . or if existing safeguards have ceased to
function”).
112 See 45 CFR 164.400 - 164.414 (Notification in the Case of Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information).
113 See 16 CFR 318 (Health Breach Notification Rule).
58
require businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving their personally
identifiable information.114 There are other rules that companies must follow in international
jurisdictions that are similar in scope to the proposed rules. For example, in the European Union,
the General Data Protection Regulation mandates disclosure of cybersecurity breaches.115 All of
the aforementioned data breach disclosure requirements may cover some of the material
incidents that companies would need to report under the proposed amendments, but not all
incidents. Additionally, the timeliness and public reporting requirements of these requirements
vary, making it difficult for investors and other market participants to be alerted to the breaches,
and to be provided with an adequate understanding of the impact of such incidents to registrants.
Some companies are also subject to other mandates to fulfill a basic level of
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. For instance, government contractors
may be subject to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, and use the National
Institute of Standards and Technology framework to manage information and privacy risks.116
Financial institutions may be subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s Standards for
Safeguarding Customer Information Rule, requiring an information security program and a
qualified individual to oversee the security program and to provide periodic reports to a
 114 Note that there are carve outs to these rules, and not every company may fall under any particular rule. See
Security Breach Notification Laws, National Conference of State Legislatures (Jan. 17, 2022), available at
https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notificationlaws.aspx.
115 See Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and
repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), arts. 33 (Notification of a personal data
breach to the supervisory authority), 34 (Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject), 2016
O.J. (L 119) 1 (“GDPR”).
116 See NIST Risk Management Framework, NIST (updated Jan. 31, 2022), available at
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/fisma-background.
59
company’s board of directors or equivalent governing body.117 Under HIPAA regulations,
covered entities are also subject to rules that require protection against reasonably anticipated
threats to electronic protected health information.118 International jurisdictions also have
cybersecurity risk mitigation measures, for example, the GDPR requires basic cybersecurity risk
mitigation measures and has governance requirements.119 These various requirements have
varying standards and requirements for reporting cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and
governance, and may not provide investors with clear and comparable disclosure regarding how
a particular registrant manages its cybersecurity risk profile.
2. Affected Parties
The proposed new disclosure requirements would apply to various filings, including
current reports, periodic reports, and certain proxy statements filed with the Commission. Thus,
the parties that are likely to be affected by the proposed rules include investors, registrants, other
market participants that use the information in these filings (such as financial analysts,
investment advisers, and portfolio managers) and external stakeholders such as consumers and
other companies in the same industry as affected firms.
We expect the proposed rules to affect all companies with relevant disclosure obligations
on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, 8-K, or 6-K, and proxy statements. This includes approximately
7,848 companies filing on domestic forms and 973 FPIs filing on foreign forms based on all
companies that filed such forms or an amendment thereto during calendar year 2020.120
 117 See 16 CFR 314.
118 See 45 CFR 164 (Security and Privacy).
119 See supra note 115, GDPR, § 32, § 37.
120 Estimates of affected registrants here are based on the number of unique CIKs with at least one periodic report,
current report, proxy filing, or an amendment to one of the three filed in calendar year 2020.
60
Our textual analysis121 of all calendar year 2020 Form 10-K filings and amendments
(7,683) reveals that out of 6,634 domestic filers approximately 64% (4,272) of them made any
cybersecurity-related disclosures. The filers’ average size in terms of total assets and market
capitalization was approximately $14.1 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively.
122 By comparison,
the average size of domestic annual report filers that did not make any cyber disclosures was
$892.6 million and $2.2 billion in terms of total assets and market capitalization, respectively.
However, the average size of all baseline affected filers was approximately $14.1 billion and
$5.6 billion in total assets and market capitalization respectively. The nature of these disclosures
is summarized in the table below, which reports the relative frequency of cyber-related
disclosures by location within the annual report conditional on a report having at least one
discussion of cybersecurity. We note that the average number of reporting locations for
registrants making cybersecurity-related disclosures on the annual report is 1.5, and registrants
making cybersecurity-related disclosures often only did so in one section of the annual report
(64%). However, many annual reports featured cybersecurity discussions in more than one
section: 25% had disclosures in 2 sections, 7% in 3 sections, and 1% in 5 or more sections.
Because of this, the percentages in Table 1 sum to greater than 100%.
 121 In performing this analysis, staff executed a combination of computer program-based keyword (and combination
of key words) searches followed by manual review to classify disclosures by location within the document.
This analysis covered 7,683 Forms 10-K and 10-K/A filed in calendar year 2020 by 6,634 registrants as
identified by unique CIK.
122 Market capitalization averages are estimated as of end of calendar year 2020. Total Asset averages are estimated
from the value for the most recently completed fiscal year reported by a registrant by year end 2020.

As presented in Table 1, approximately 94% (4,029) of Form 10-K or amendment filers
that provided any cyber-related disclosures included discussion of cybersecurity as a material
risk factor in Item 1A.
62
We further estimate that, in 2020, approximately 603 domestic companies reported
having a director on their board with cybersecurity experience or expertise. This estimate is
based on a review of cybersecurity disclosures by registrants that filed either a Form 10-K or an
amended Form 10-K in 2020 that included cybersecurity-related language in their Item 10
(Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant) discussion or provided similar disclosures in
a proxy filing instead.123
Finally, there were a total of 74,098 Form 8-K filings in 2020, involving 7,021 filers, out
of which 40 filings reported material cybersecurity incidents. Similarly, there were a total of
23,373 Form 6-K filings in 2020, involving 979 filers, out of which 27 filings reported material
cybersecurity incidents. Filers of annual, quarterly, or current reports (Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 20-F,
8-K, or 6-K) including a cybersecurity discussion in any form included 104 business
development companies.
C. Potential Benefits and Costs of the Proposed Amendments
We have considered the potential benefits and costs associated with the proposed
amendments. The proposed rules would benefit investors and other market participants by
providing more timely and informative disclosures relating to cybersecurity incidents and
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, facilitating investor decision-making
and reducing information asymmetry in the market. The proposed amendments also would entail
costs. For instance, in addition to the costs of providing the disclosure itself, more detailed
disclosure could potentially increase the vulnerability of registrants and the risk of future attacks.
A discussion of the anticipated economic costs and benefits of the proposed amendments is set
forth in more detail below. We first discuss benefits to investors (and other market participants,
 123 Based on manual review of the total of 15,565 proxy filings filed in 2020 and the 1,600 of them that mentioned
cybersecurity.
63
such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and portfolio managers) and registrants. We
subsequently discuss costs to investors and registrants. We conclude with a discussion of
indirect economic effects on registrants and external stakeholders, such as consumers, and
companies in the same industry with registrants or those facing similar cybersecurity threats.
We also expect the proposed amendments to affect compliance burdens. The quantitative
estimates of changes in those burdens for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(“PRA”) are further discussed in Section [IV] below. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that
the proposed amendments would result in an increase of 2,000 and 180 burden hours from the
increase in the number Form 8-K and Form 6-K filings respectively.
124 In addition, the
estimated increase in the paperwork burden as a result of the proposed amendments for Form 10-
Q, Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Schedule 14A, and Schedule 14C would be 3,000 hours, 132,576
hours, 12,028.50 hours, 3,900 hours, and 342 hours respectively.125
1. Benefits
Investors would be the main beneficiaries from the enhanced disclosure of both
cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance as a result
of the proposed amendments. Specifically, investors would benefit because: (1) more
informative and timely disclosure would reduce mispricing of securities in the market and
facilitate their decision making; and (2) more uniform and comparable disclosures would lower
search costs and information processing costs. Other market participants that rely on financial
statement information to provide services to investors, such as financial analysts, investment
advisers, and portfolio managers, could also benefit. Registrants could benefit, because the
 124 See infra section IV.
125 Id.
64
enhanced disclosure as a result of the proposed amendments could reduce information
asymmetry and potentially lower registrants’ cost of capital.
a. Benefits to investors
(i) More Informative and More Timely Disclosure
More informative and timely disclosures would reduce mispricing of securities in the
market and facilitate investor decision making. Information benefits would result from both
types of disclosure,126 and timeliness benefits would result from the proposed cybersecurity
incident disclosure.
The proposed amendments would provide more informative disclosures related to
cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance compared
to the current disclosure framework, benefiting investors. The increase in disclosure would
allow investors to better understand a registrant’s cybersecurity risks and ability to manage such
risks, and thereby make more informed investment decisions. As discussed in Section I,
currently, there are no disclosure requirements that explicitly refer to cybersecurity risks or
incidents. While existing disclosure requirements may apply to material cybersecurity incidents
and various cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts, as highlighted in the 2011 Staff Guidance
and the 2018 Interpretive Release, the existing disclosure requirements are more general in
nature, and the resulting disclosures have not been consistently sufficient or necessarily
informative.
 126 Throughout this section, we use the term “both types of disclosure” to refer to the disclosure of (1) cybersecurity
incidents and (2) cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.
65
Specifically, regarding incident reporting, there is concern that material cybersecurity
incidents are underreported,127 and staff has observed that certain cybersecurity incidents were
reported in the media but not disclosed in a registrant’s filings.128 Even when registrants have
filed Form 8-K to report an incident, the Form 8-K did not necessarily state whether or not the
incident was material, and in some cases, the Form 8-K stated that the incident was
immaterial.
129 By requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents in a current
report and disclose any material changes, additions, or updates in a periodic report, the proposed
amendments could elicit more incident reporting. Because the proposed incident disclosure
requirements also specify that registrants would disclose information such as when the incident
was discovered, and the nature and scope of the incident, they could also result in more
informative incident reporting.
Similarly, the proposed disclosure about cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and
governance would include a number of specific items that registrants must disclose. For
instance, the proposed rules would require disclosure regarding a registrant’s policies and
procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks.130 The proposed rules would also
require disclosure concerning whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect a registrant’s
selection and oversight of third-party service providers because a significant number of
cybersecurity incidents pertain to third party service providers.131 As a result, the proposed rules
 127 See supra section II.B and note 46.
128 See supra section I.B.
129 Based on staff analysis of the current and periodic reports in 2021 for companies identified by as having been
affected by a cybersecurity incident.
130 See supra section II.D.
131 See supra section II.D.
66
related to risk management, strategy, and governance could also lead to more informative
disclosure to investors.
We anticipate the proposed cybersecurity incident reporting would also lead to more
timely disclosure to investors. As discussed above, currently, it could take months for
registrants to disclose a material cybersecurity incident after its discovery.132 The proposed
amendments would require these incidents to be disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K within
four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity
incident.
More informative and timely disclosure as a result of the proposed amendments would
benefit investors because the enhanced disclosure could allow them to better understand the
impact of a cybersecurity incident on the registrant, the risk a registrant is facing and its ability to
manage the risk. Such information is relevant to the valuation of registrants’ securities and
thereby investors’ decision making. It is well documented in the academic literature that the
market reacts negatively to announcements of cybersecurity incidents. For example, one study
finds a significant mean cumulative abnormal return of -0.84% in the three days following
cyberattack announcements, which, according to the study, translates into an average value loss
of $495 million per attack.133 Another study finds that firms with higher exposure to
 132 See supra note 95, section III.A.
133 See Shinichi Kamiya, Jun-Koo Kang, Jungmin Kim, Andreas Milidonis, and René M. Stulz, Risk Management,
Firm Reputation, and the Impact of Successful Cyberattacks on Target Firms, 139 (3) J. OF FIN. ECON. 721,
719-749 (2021). See also Lawrence A. Gordon, Martin P. Loeb, and Lei Zhou, The Impact of Information
Security Breaches: Has There Been a Downward Shift in Costs?, 19 (1) J. OF COMPUT. SEC. 33, 33-56 (2011)
(finding “the impact of the broad class of information security breaches on stock market returns of firms is
significant”); see also Georgios Spanos and Lefteris Angelis, The Impact of Information Security Events to the
Stock Market: A Systematic Literature Review, 58 COMPUT. & SEC. 216-229 (2016) (documenting that the
majority (75.6%) of the studies the paper reviewed report statistical significance of the impact of security events
to the stock prices of firms). But see Katherine Campbell, Lawrence A. Gordon, Martin P. Loeb, and Lei Zhou,
The Economic Cost of Publicly Announced Information Security Breaches: Empirical Evidence From the Stock
Market, 11 (3) J. OF COMPUT. SEC. 432, 431-448 (2003) (while finding limited evidence of an overall negative
67
cybersecurity risk have a higher cost of capital, suggesting that this risk is important to
investors.
134 Therefore, whether a registrant is prepared for cybersecurity risks and has adequate
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance measures in place to reduce the
likelihood of future incidents are important information for investors and the market. Delayed or
incomplete reporting of cybersecurity incidents and risks could lead to mispricing of the
securities and information asymmetry in the market, harming investors.
In addition, the mispricing resulting from delayed or limited disclosure could be
exploited by the malicious actors who caused a cybersecurity incident, or those who could access
and trade on material information stolen during a cybersecurity incident, causing further harm to
investors.135 Malicious actors may trade ahead of an announcement of a data breach that they
caused or pilfer material information to trade on ahead of company announcements. Trading on
undisclosed cybersecurity information is particularly pernicious, because profits generated from
this type of trading would provide incentives for malicious actors to “create” more incidents and
proprietary information to trade on.136 More informative and timely disclosure as a result of the
proposed amendments would reduce mispricing and information asymmetry, and thereby reduce

stock market reaction to public announcements of information security breaches, they also find “the nature of
the breach affects this result”, and “a highly significant negative market reaction for information security
breaches involving unauthorized access to confidential data, but no significant reaction when the breach does
not involve confidential information”; they thus conclude that “stock market participants appear to discriminate
across types of breaches when assessing their economic impact on affected firms”).

w28196), NAT’L BUREAU OF ECON. RSCH, (2020).

(“In many respects, then, the cyberhacker plays a role in creating and imposing a unique harm on the targeted
company-one that (in our view) is qualitatively different from "exogenous" information shocks serendipitously
observed by an information trader. Allowing a coordinated hacker-trader team to capture these arbitrage gains
would implicitly subsidize the very harm-creating activity that is being "discovered" in the first instance.”).

opportunities for malicious actors to exploit the mispricing, all of which would enhance investor
protection.
Overall, we believe enhanced disclosure as a result of the proposed amendments could
benefit investors by allowing them to make more informed decisions. Similarly, other market
participants that rely on financial statement information to provide services to investors would
also benefit, because more informative and timely disclosure would allow them to better
understand a registrant’s cybersecurity risks and ability to manage such risks. As a result, they
would be able to better evaluate registrants’ securities and provide better recommendations.
However, we note that the potential benefit could be reduced to the extent that registrants have
already been providing the relevant disclosures.
We are unable to quantify the potential benefit to investors and other market participants
as a result of the increase in disclosure and improvement in pricing under the proposed
amendments. The estimation requires information about the fundamental value of securities and
the extent of the mispricing. We do not have access to such information, and therefore cannot
provide a reasonable estimate.
(ii) Greater Uniformity and Comparability
The proposed disclosure about cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance could also lead to more uniform and comparable
disclosures, benefiting investors by lowering their search costs and information processing costs.
As discussed in Section I, while some registrants currently file Form 8-K to report an incident,
their reporting practices vary widely.137 Some provide a discussion of materiality, the estimated
costs of an incident, or the remedial steps taken as a result of an incident, while others do not
 137 See supra section I.B.
69
provide such disclosure or provide much less detail in their disclosure. Disclosures related to
risk management, strategy, and governance also vary significantly across registrants—such
information could be disclosed in places such as the risk factors section, or in the management’s
discussion and analysis section of Form 10-K, or not at all. Investors currently may find it costly
to compare the disclosures of different companies because they would have to spend time to
search and retrieve information from different locations. For both types of disclosures, the
proposed amendments would specify the topics to be disclosed and the reporting sections to
include such disclosures, and as a result, both the incident disclosure and risk management,
strategy, and governance disclosure should be more uniform across registrants, making it easier
to compare. By specifying a set of topics that registrants should disclose, the proposed
disclosure requirement should provide investors and other market participants with a benchmark
of a minimum set of information for registrants to disclose, allowing them to better evaluate and
compare registrants’ cybersecurity risk and disclosure.
We note that to the extent that the disclosures related to cybersecurity risk management,
strategy, and governance become too uniform or “boilerplate,” the benefit of comparability may
be diminished. However, we also note that given the level of the specificity that would be
required, the resulting disclosures are unlikely to become boilerplate.
The proposed requirement to tag the cybersecurity disclosure in Inline XBRL would
likely augment the aforementioned informational and comparability benefits by making the
proposed disclosures more easily retrievable and usable for aggregation, comparison, filtering,
and other analysis. XBRL requirements for public operating company financial statement
70
disclosures have been observed to mitigate information asymmetry by reducing information
processing costs, thereby making the disclosures easier to access and analyze.138
While these observations are specific to operating company financial statement
disclosures and not to disclosures outside the financial statements, such as the proposed
cybersecurity disclosures, they suggest that the proposed Inline XBRL requirements could
directly or indirectly (i.e., through information intermediaries such as financial media, data
aggregators, and academic researchers) provide investors with increased insight into
cybersecurity-related information at specific companies and across companies, industries, and
time periods.139 Also, unlike XBRL financial statements (including footnotes), which consist of
tagged quantitative and narrative disclosures, the proposed cybersecurity disclosures would
consist largely of tagged narrative disclosures.140 Tagging narrative disclosures can facilitate
analytical benefits such as automatic comparison or redlining of these disclosures against prior
periods and the performance of targeted artificial intelligence or machine learning assessments
 138 See, e.g., J.Z. Chen, H.A. Hong, J.B. Kim, and J.W. Ryou, Information processing costs and corporate tax
avoidance: Evidence from the SEC’s XBRL mandate, 40 J. OF ACCT. AND PUB. POL’Y. 2 (finding XBRL reporting
decreases likelihood of firm tax avoidance because “XBRL reporting reduces the cost of IRS monitoring in
terms of information processing, which dampens managerial incentives to engage in tax avoidance behavior”);
see also P.A. Griffin, H.. A., Hong, J-B, Kim, and Jee- Hae Lim, The SEC’s XBRL Mandate and Credit Risk:
Evidence on a Link between Credit Default Swap Pricing and XBRL Disclosure, 2014 AMERICAN ACCOUNTING
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING (2014) (finding XBRL reporting enables better outside monitoring of firms by
creditors, leading to a reduction in firm default risk); see also E. Blankespoor, The Impact of Information
Processing Costs on Firm Disclosure Choice: Evidence from the XBRL Mandate, 57 J. OF ACC. RES. 919, 919-
967 (2019) (finding “firms increase their quantitative footnote disclosures upon implementation of XBRL
detailed tagging requirements designed to reduce information users’ processing costs,” and “both regulatory and
non-regulatory market participants play a role in monitoring firm disclosures,” suggesting “that the processing
costs of market participants can be significant enough to impact firms’ disclosure decisions”).
139 See, e.g., N. Trentmann, Companies Adjust Earnings for Covid-19 Costs, but Are They Still a One-Time
Expense?, THE WALL STREET J. (2020) (citing an XBRL research software provider as a source for the analysis
described in the article); see also Bloomberg Lists BSE XBRL Data, XBRL.org (2018); see also R. Hoitash, and
U. Hoitash, Measuring Accounting Reporting Complexity with XBRL, 93 ACCOUNT. REV. 259 (2018).
140 The proposed cybersecurity disclosure requirements do not expressly require the disclosure of any quantitative
values; if a registrant includes any quantitative values that are nested within the required discussion (e.g.,
disclosing the number of days until containment of a cybersecurity incident), those values would be individually
detail tagged, in addition to the block text tagging of the narrative disclosures.
71
(tonality, sentiment, risk words, etc.) of specific cybersecurity disclosures rather than the entire
unstructured document.141
b. Benefits to registrants142
The proposed amendments regarding both incident reporting and risk management,
strategy, and governance disclosure could potentially lower registrants’ cost of capital, especially
for those who currently have strong cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance
measures in place. Economic theory suggests that better disclosure could reduce information
asymmetry between management and investors, reducing the cost of capital, and thereby
improving firms’ liquidity and their access to capital markets.143 In an asymmetric information
environment, investors recognize that registrants may take advantage of their position by issuing
securities at a price that is higher than justified by the issuer’s fundamental value. As a result,
investors demand a discount to compensate for the risk of adverse selection. This discount
translates into a higher cost of capital.144 By providing more disclosure, the firm can reduce the
 141 To illustrate, without Inline XBRL, using the search term “remediation” to search through the text of all
registrants’ filings over a certain period of time, so as to analyze the trends in registrants’ disclosures related to
cybersecurity incident remediation efforts during that period, could return many narrative disclosures outside of
the cybersecurity incident discussion (e.g., disclosures related to potential environmental liabilities in the risk
factors section). If Inline XBRL is used, however, it would enable a user to search for the term “remediation”
exclusively within the proposed cybersecurity disclosures, thereby likely reducing the number of irrelevant
results.
142 While registrants are legally distinct entities from investors, benefits and costs to registrants as a result of the
proposed amendments would ultimately accrue to their investors.
143 See Douglas W. Diamond and Robert E. Verrecchia, Disclosure, Liquidity, and the Cost of Capital, 46 J. FIN.
1325, 1325–1359 (1991) (finding that revealing public information to reduce information asymmetry can reduce
a firm’s cost of capital through increased liquidity). See also Christian Leuz and Robert E. Verrecchia, The
Economic Consequences of Increased Disclosure, 38 J. ACCT. RES. 91 (2000) (providing empirical evidence
that increased disclosure lowers the information asymmetry component of the cost of capital in a sample of
German firms); see also Christian Leuz and Peter D. Wysocki, The Economics of Disclosure and Financial
Reporting Regulation: Evidence and Suggestions for Future Research, 54 J. ACCT. RES. 525 (2016) (providing
a comprehensive survey of the literature on the economic effect of disclosure).
144 See Leuz and Verrecchia, The Economic Consequences of Increased Disclosure, 38 J. ACCT. RES. 91 (2000)
(stating: “A brief sketch of the economic theory is as follows. Information asymmetries create costs by
introducing adverse selection into transactions between buyers and sellers of firm shares. In real institutional
settings, adverse selection is typically manifest in reduced levels of liquidity for firm shares (e.g., Copeland and
72
risk of adverse selection faced by investors and the discount they demand, ultimately decreasing
the firm’s cost of capital.145 Applying this theory to cybersecurity disclosure, the increased
disclosure as a result of the proposed amendments could decrease the cost of capital and increase
firm value.
The proposed amendments’ effect on cost of capital might vary depending on registrants’
current level of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance and whether they are
already making disclosures regarding their efforts. To the extent that they have not been making
the proposed disclosure, registrants with stronger cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and
governance measures could be priced more favorably under the proposed amendments because
the proposed disclosure would allow the market to better differentiate them from the registrants
with less robust measures. To the extent that some registrants are already making disclosures
about their robust cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance programs, these
registrants would benefit less. However, if registrants that previously had less robust
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclose improvements in their

Galai [1983], Kyle [1985], and Glosten and Milgrom [1985]). To overcome the reluctance of potential
investors to hold firm shares in illiquid markets, firms must issue capital at a discount. Discounting results in
fewer proceeds to the firm and hence higher costs of capital. A commitment to increased levels of disclosure
reduces the possibility of information asymmetries arising either between the firm and its shareholders or
among potential buyers and sellers of firm shares. This, in turn, should reduce the discount at which firm shares
are sold, and hence lower the costs of issuing capital (e.g., Diamond and Verrecchia [1991] and Baiman and
Verrecchia [1996]).”).
145 Although disclosure could be beneficial for the firm, several conditions must be met for firms to voluntarily
disclose all their private information. See Anne Beyer, Daniel A. Cohen, Thomas Z. Lys, and Beverly R.
Walther, The Financial Reporting Environment: Review Of The Recent Literature, 50 J. ACCT. & ECON. 296,
296-343 (2010) (discussing conditions under which firms voluntarily disclose all their private information, and
these conditions include “(1) disclosures are costless; (2) investors know that firms have, in fact, private
information; (3) all investors interpret the firms’ disclosure in the same way and firms know how investors will
interpret that disclosure; (4) managers want to maximize their firms’ share prices; (5) firms can credibly
disclose their private information; and (6) firms cannot commit ex-ante to a specific disclosure policy.”).
Increased reporting could also help determine the effect of investment on firm value. See Lawrence A. Gordon,
Martin P. Loeb, William Lucyshyn, and Lei Zhou, The Impact of Information Sharing on Cybersecurity
Underinvestment: A Real Options Perspective, 34 (5) J. ACCT. & PUB. POLICY 509, 509-519 (2015) (arguing
that “information sharing could reduce the tendency by firms to defer cybersecurity investments.”).
73
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance in response to the proposed
amendments, their cost of capital could also decrease.
Registrants could also benefit from more uniform regulations regarding the timing of
disclosures and the types of cybersecurity incident and risk disclosures as a result of the
proposed amendments. Currently, the stigma or reputation loss associated with cybersecurity
breaches may result in companies limiting reporting about or delaying reporting of cybersecurity
incidents.146 If all registrants are required to report cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K within
four business days as proposed, this could reduce the reputation costs that any one company
might suffer after reporting an attack and also reduce the incentives to underreport.
In addition, by formalizing the disclosure requirements related to cybersecurity incidents
and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance and specifying the topics to be
discussed, the proposed amendments could reduce compliance costs for those registrants who are
currently providing disclosure about these topics. The compliance costs would only be reduced
to the extent that those registrants may be over-disclosing information, because there is
uncertainty about what is required under the current rules. For instance, the staff has observed
that some registrants provide Form 8-K filings even when they do not anticipate the incident will
have a material adverse impact on their business operations, or financial results.147
We are unable to quantify these potential benefits to registrants as a result of the
proposed amendments due to lack of data. For example, we are unable to observe the actual
 146 See supra note 133, Kamiya, at 720 (Kamiya et al.) (2021), (stating “we find that successful cyberattacks have
potentially economically large reputation costs in that the shareholder wealth loss far exceeds the out-of- pocket
costs from the attack”). See also Eli Amir, Shai Levi, and Tsafrir Livne, Do Firms Underreport Information on
Cyber-Attacks? Evidence from Capital Markets, 23 (3) REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 1177-1206 (2018)
(finding evidence that is consistent with managers withholding information on cyber-attacks, and particularly
the information on the more severe attacks).
147 See supra note 129 and accompanying text.
74
cybersecurity risk registrants are facing. Without such information, we cannot provide a
reasonable estimate on how registrants’ cybersecurity risk and therefore their cost of capital may
decrease.
2. Costs
We also recognize that enhanced cybersecurity disclosure could result in costs to
registrants, depending on the timing and extent of the disclosure. These costs include potential
increases in registrants’ vulnerability, information uncertainty, and compliance costs. We
discuss these costs below.
First, the proposed disclosure about cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance could potentially increase the vulnerability of registrants.
Ever since the issuance of the 2011 Staff Guidance, concerns have been raised that providing
detailed disclosures of cybersecurity incidents can create the risk of providing a road map for
future attacks.148 The concern is that malicious actors could use the disclosures to potentially
gain insights into a registrant's practices on cybersecurity issues and thus better calibrate future
attacks.
The proposed changes to Form 8-K and Form 6-K would require registrants to timely file
current reports on these forms to disclose material cybersecurity incidents. The proposed
disclosures include, for example, the nature and scope of the disclosed incident and whether the
registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incidents. While we have clarified that
we would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its
planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or
potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrant’s response or
 148 See, e.g., Roland L. Trope and Sarah Jane Hughes, The SEC Staff's Cybersecurity Disclosure Guidance: Will It
Help Investors or Cyber-Thieves More, 2011 BUS. L. TODAY 2, 1-4 (2011).

remediation of the incident (to the extent that a registrant discloses information that could
provide clues to malicious actors regarding a registrant’s areas of vulnerability) it may face
increased risk. Malicious actors could engage in further attacks based on the information,
especially given that registrants would also need to make timely disclosure, which could mean
that the underlying security issues might not have been completely resolved, thereby potentially
exacerbating the ongoing attack. As a result, the proposed incident disclosure rules could
potentially increase the vulnerability of registrants, imposing a cost on them and their investors.
Similar concerns could be raised about the proposed risk management, strategy, and
governance disclosure. Specifically, proposed Item 407(j) would require registrants to disclose
whether a member of its board of directors has cybersecurity expertise, and proposed new Items
106(b) and (c) would require registrants to provide specified disclosure regarding their
cybersecurity policies and procedures and cybersecurity governance by a company’s
management and board. The required disclosure could provide malicious actors information
about which companies lack a board of directors with cybersecurity expertise, and which ones
have weak policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risk management, and allow such
malicious actors to determine their targets accordingly.
However, academic research so far has not provided evidence that more detailed
cybersecurity risk disclosures would necessarily lead to more attacks.149 For example, one study
finds that measures for specificity (e.g., the uniqueness of the disclosure) do not have a
statistically significant relation with subsequent cybersecurity incidents.150 Another study finds
 149 We note that the papers we cited below study the effect of voluntary disclosure and 2011 Staff Guidance. The
results from these studies might not be generalizable to the mandatory disclosures under the proposed rules.
150 See He Li, Won Gyun No, and Tawei Wang, SEC's Cybersecurity Disclosure Guidance and Disclosed
Cybersecurity Risk Factors, 30 INT’L. J. OF ACCT. INFO. SYS. 40-55 (2018) (stating: “while Ferraro (2013)
criticizes that the SEC did little to resolve the concern about publicly revealing too much information [that]
76
that the disclosed security risk factors with risk-mitigation themes are less likely to be related to
future breach announcements.151 On the other hand, we note that the proposed amendments
would require more details than under the current rules, and the uniformity of the proposed
requirements might also make it easier for malicious actors to identify firms with deficiencies.
Therefore, these findings might not be generalizable to the effects of the proposed amendments.
Additionally, the costs resulting from this potential vulnerability might be partially mitigated to
the extent that registrants may decide to enhance their cybersecurity risk management in
anticipation of the increased disclosure.
Second, the proposed cybersecurity incident disclosure could potentially increase
information uncertainty related to securities, because the disclosure about the impact of the
incident on the registrant’s operations may lack the precision needed for investors and the market
to properly value these securities. While the proposed changes to Form 8-K could improve the
timeliness of cybersecurity incident reporting and result in more disclosure about the impact of
the incident on the registrant’s operations, the proposed rules do not require registrants to
quantify the impact of the incident. As a result, registrants’ disclosure about the impact of a
cybersecurity incident could be qualitative in nature or lack the precision needed for investors
and the market to properly value the securities, potentially leading to information uncertainty,
investor under or overreaction to certain disclosures, and thereby mispricing of registrants’
securities.

could provide potential hackers with a roadmap for successful attacks, we find no evidence supporting such
claim”).

Realization of Information Security Risk Factors, 24.2 INFO. SYS. RSCH. 201, 201-218 (2013).
152 See Daniel Kent, David Hirshleifer, and Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, Investor Psychology and Security Market
under-and Overreactions, J. OF FIN. 1839-1885 (1998) (showing that investor behavioral biases such as
overconfidence can cause them to under- or over-react to information); see Nicholas Barberis, Andrei Shleifer,
77
Additionally, while the proposed disclosure could have the overall effect of reducing
registrants’ cost of capital as discussed in Section III.C.1.b, we also recognize that a subset of
registrants might experience an increase in costs of capital. More specifically, under the
proposed amendments, registrants with less robust cybersecurity risk management measures
might be priced more unfavorably compared to those with stronger measures, potentially leading
to an increase in cost of capital for these registrants. This is because the increased transparency
as a result of the proposed disclosure could allow investors to better differentiate registrants’
preparedness and ability to manage cybersecurity risks. However, except for this scenario, we
expect that registrants overall would benefit from reduced cost of capital as a result of the
proposed disclosure as discussed in Section III.C.1.b.
Finally, the proposed rules would impose compliance costs for registrants. Registrants
would incur one-time and ongoing costs to fulfill the proposed new disclosure requirements
under Items 106 and 407 of Regulation S-K. These costs would include costs to gather the
information and prepare the disclosures.
Registrants would also incur compliance costs to fulfill the proposed disclosure
requirements related to Form 8-K (Form 6-K for FPIs) incident reporting and Form 10-Q/10-K
(Form 20-F for FPIs) ongoing reporting.153 These costs include one-time costs to implement or

and Robert Vishny, A Model of Investor Sentiment, 49 (3) J. OF FIN. ECON. 307-343 (1998)(presenting a model
of investor sentiment to explain the empirical findings of underreaction of stock prices to news such as earnings
announcements, and overreaction of stock prices to a series of good or bad news based on two psychological
phenomena, conservatism and representativeness heuristic); see also David Hirshleifer, Investor Psychology
and Asset Pricing, 56 J. OF FIN. 1533, 1533–1596 (2001) (stating: “[m]ore generally, greater uncertainty about
a set of stocks, and a lack of accurate feedback about their fundamentals, leaves more room for psychological
biases. At the extreme, it is relatively hard to misperceive an asset that is nearly risk-free. Thus, the
misvaluation effects of almost any mistaken-beliefs model should be strongest among firms about which there
is high uncertainty/poor information (cash flow variance is one possible proxy).”).
153 We note that the compliance costs related to Form 6-K filings would be mitigated, because a condition of the
form is that the information is disclosed or required to be disclosed elsewhere.
78
revise their incident disclosure practices, so that any registrant that determines it has experienced
a material cybersecurity incident would disclose such incident with the required information
within four business days. Registrants would also incur ongoing costs to disclose in a periodic
report any material changes, additions, or updates relating to previously disclosed incidents, and
to monitor whether any previously undisclosed immaterial cybersecurity incidents have become
material in the aggregate, triggering a disclosure obligation. The costs would be mitigated for
registrants whose current disclosure practices match or are similar to those that are proposed. To
the extent that registrants fall under other incident reporting requirements or cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance mandates as outlined in Section III.B.1, their costs from
the proposed amendments would be mitigated as well.
We note that BDCs could be subject to both the proposed rules and rule amendments in
the Investment Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release154 and those proposed in this
release if both proposals were to be adopted. To the extent that BDCs would need to provide
substantively the same or similar disclosure on both Form 8-K and in registration statements, the
compliance costs could be duplicative. However, the potential duplication should not result in a
significant increase in compliance costs, because BDCs should be able to provide similar
disclosure for both sets of rules.
155
The compliance costs would also include costs attributable to the Inline XBRL tagging
requirements. Various preparation solutions have been developed and used by operating
companies to fulfill XBRL requirements, and some evidence suggests that, for smaller
 154 See Investment Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release.
155 See infra section VI.E.
79
companies, XBRL compliance costs have decreased over time.156 The incremental compliance
costs associated with Inline XBRL tagging of cybersecurity disclosures would also be mitigated
by the fact that most registrants who would be subject to the proposed requirements are already
subject to other Inline XBRL requirements for other disclosures in Commission filings, including
financial statement and cover page disclosures in certain periodic reports and registration
statements.157 Such registrants may be able to leverage existing Inline XBRL preparation
processes and expertise in complying with the proposed cybersecurity disclosure tagging
requirements. Asset-backed securities issuers, however, are not subject to Inline XBRL
requirements in Commission filings and would likely incur initial Inline XBRL compliance
implementation costs (such as the cost of training in-house staff to prepare filings in Inline
XBRL, and the cost to license Inline XBRL filing preparation software from vendors).158
Other than the Paperwork Reduction Act costs discussed in Section IV below, we are
unable to quantify the potential increase in costs related to the proposed rules due to the lack of
data. For example, we lack data to estimate how registrants’ cybersecurity vulnerability would
change under the proposal, because such change would depend on their current level of
vulnerability. We are also unable to estimate the potential increase in mispricing as a result of
 156 An AICPA survey of 1,032 reporting companies with $75 million or less in market capitalization in 2018 found
an average cost of $5,850 per year, a median cost of $2,500 per year, and a maximum cost of $51,500 per year
for fully outsourced XBRL creation and filing, representing a 45% decline in average cost and a 69% decline in
median cost since 2014. See Michael Cohn, AICPA Sees 45% Drop in XBRL Costs for Small Companies,
ACCOUNTING TODAY (Aug. 15, 2018) (stating that a 2018 NASDAQ survey of 151 listed registrants found an
average XBRL compliance cost of $20,000 per quarter, a median XBRL compliance cost of $7,500 per quarter,
and a maximum, XBRL compliance cost of $350,000 per quarter in XBRL costs per quarter), available at

the information uncertainty, because the level of the uncertainty would depend on registrants’
disclosure.
3. Indirect Economic Effects
Besides the direct economic effects on investors, registrants and other market participants
we discussed above, we recognize that the proposed amendments could also indirectly affect
registrants and external stakeholders, such as consumers, companies in the same industry with
registrants or those facing similar cybersecurity threats.
While the proposal would only require disclosures—not changes to registrants’ board
composition or risk management practices—the disclosures themselves could result in certain
indirect benefits. Registrants might respond to the proposed disclosures by devoting more
resources to cybersecurity governance and risk management. To the extent that registrants may
decide to enhance their cybersecurity risk management in anticipation of the increased
disclosure, it could reduce registrants’ susceptibility to a cybersecurity-attack and thereby the
likelihood of future incidents, indirectly benefiting registrants.
Registrants may also decide to incur certain indirect costs as a result of the proposed
amendments. For example, the proposed rules would require disclosure of whether members of
the board or management staff have expertise in cybersecurity. Although not required, some
registrants may respond by adding a board member or staff to their management team with
cybersecurity expertise. Similarly, the proposed rules would require disclosure on policies and
procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks. While not required under the proposed
rules, it is possible that registrants would respond by allocating more resources to devise,
implement, or improve their policies and procedures related to cybersecurity to the extent they
currently do not have similar policies and procedures in place. Similarly, indirect costs could
result if a registrant were to decide to hire a chief information security officer or other
81
individuals with cybersecurity expertise to their management team. Further, if many registrants
move to add a board member or staff to their management team with cybersecurity expertise, or
a chief information security officer at the same time, the costs to registrants associated with
adding such individuals may increase if demand for cybersecurity expertise increases. This is
especially true to the extent that certain relevant certifications or degrees are seen as important
designations of cybersecurity expertise and there are a limited pool of individuals holding such
certifications.
In addition, the proposed requirement to tag the cybersecurity disclosure in Inline XBRL
could have indirect effects on registrants. As discussed in section III.C.1.a.(ii), XBRL
requirements for public operating company financial statement disclosures could reduce
information processing cost. This reduction in information processing cost has been observed to
facilitate the monitoring of companies by other market participants, and, as a result, to influence
companies’ behavior, including their disclosure choices.159
The proposed amendments to require registrants to timely disclose material cybersecurity
incidents could indirectly benefit external stakeholders such as other companies in the same
industry, those facing similar cybersecurity threats or consumers. Cybersecurity incidents could
result in costs not only to the company that suffers the incident, but also to other businesses and
consumers. For example, a cybersecurity breach at one company may cause a major disruption
or shut down of a critical infrastructure industry, such as a gas pipeline, a bank, or power
company, resulting in massive losses throughout the economy.160 Timely disclosure of
 159 See supra note 138.
160 See Lawrence A. Gordon, Martin P. Loeb, William Lucyshyn, and Lei Zhou, Externalities and the Magnitude of
Cyber Security Underinvestment by Private Sector Firms: A Modification of the Gordon-Loeb Model, 6 (1) J.
OF INFO. SEC. 24, 24-30 (2014) (stating: “[f]irms in the private sector of many countries own a large share of
critical infrastructure assets. Hence, cybersecurity breaches in private sector firms could cause a major
82
cybersecurity incidents as proposed could increase awareness by those external stakeholders that
the malicious activities are occurring. More specifically, for companies in the same industry as
registrants or for those facing similar cybersecurity threats, the proposed disclosure could alert
them to a potential threat and allow them to better prepare for a specific potential cybersecurity
attack. To the extent that the proposed amendments increase available disclosure, consumers
may benefit from learning the extent of a particular cybersecurity breach, and therefore take
appropriate actions to limit potential economic costs that they may incur from the breach. For
example, there is evidence that increased disclosure of cybersecurity incidents by registrants can
reduce the risk of identity theft for individuals.161 Also, consumers may be able to make better
informed decisions about which companies to trust with their personal information.
In addition, the proposed amendments regarding cybersecurity risk management,
strategy, and governance disclosure could indirectly benefit external stakeholders through
potentially reduced likelihood of future incidents and negative externalities associated with the
incidents. As discussed above, to the extent that registrants may decide to enhance their
cybersecurity risk management in anticipation of the increased disclosure, it could reduce
registrants’ susceptibility to a cybersecurity-attack and thereby the likelihood of future incidents,
leading to positive spillover effects.
We are unable to quantify the indirect effects as a result of the proposed amendments
because we lack data or basis to estimate the potential changes in disclosure of cybersecurity

disruption of a critical infrastructure industry (e.g., delivery of electricity), resulting in massive losses
throughout the economy, putting the defense of the nation at risk.”). We note that this study focused on private
firms; however, same statement could be made about public companies that own a large share of critical
infrastructure assets. See also U.S. Pipeline Cyberattack Forces Closure, WALL ST J., available at

state-level data breach disclosure laws reduced identity theft by 6.1 percent).
83
incidents, risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure and the reduction in negative
spill-over effects.
D. Anticipated Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
Overall, we believe the proposed rules could have positive effects on market efficiency.
As discussed above, the proposed rules could improve the timeliness and informativeness of
cybersecurity risk disclosure. Investors and other market participants could better understand the
cybersecurity threats registrants are facing, their potential impact, and registrants’ ability to
respond to and manage risks under the proposed rules, and thereby better evaluate registrants’
securities and make more informed decisions. As a result, the proposed disclosures could reduce
information asymmetry and mispricing in the market, improving liquidity and market efficiency.
However, we also recognize that, because registrants’ disclosure about the impact of a
cybersecurity incident could be qualitative in nature and lack the precision needed for investors
and the market to properly value the securities, the proposed incident disclosure might lead to
information uncertainty and investor overreaction. We believe such effect should be reduced by
more informative reporting from other aspects of the proposed disclosure and subsequent updates
in periodic reports.
A more efficient market as a result of the proposed rules could promote competition
among firms. Because the enhanced incident reporting and cybersecurity risk management,
strategy, and governance disclosure could allow investors to better evaluate the relative
cybersecurity risks for different registrants, firms that disclose robust cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance could benefit from a competitive advantage relative to
firms that do not. This could have a secondary effect of further incentivizing firms that to-date
have invested less in cybersecurity preparation to invest more, to the benefit of investors, in
order to become more competitive.
84
More efficient prices and more liquid markets could help allocate capital to its most
efficient uses. Enhanced disclosure of cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance could allow investors to make more informed investment
decisions. As a result, companies that disclose more robust cybersecurity risk management,
strategy, and governance and thus may be less susceptible to cybersecurity incidents may receive
more capital allocation. By making information related to material incident available to the
public sooner, and reducing the information asymmetry, the proposed amendments could
increase public trust in markets, thereby aiding in capital formation.
E. Reasonable Alternatives
1. Website Disclosure
As an alternative to Form 8-K disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, we
considered providing companies with the option of disclosing this information through company
websites, instead of through filing a Form 8-K, when the company has disclosed its intention to
do so in its most recent annual report and subject to information availability and retention
requirements. While this approach may be less costly for the registrant as it may involve fewer
compliance costs and less legal liability compared to a filing of a Form 8-K, the website
disclosure would not be located in the same place as other companies’ disclosures of material
cybersecurity incidents. Also, disclosures made on company websites would not be organized
into the standardized sections found in Form 8-K and could thus be less uniform.
The lack of a central repository, such as the EDGAR system,
162 and a lack of uniformity
of website disclosures could increase the costs for investors and other market participants to
 162 EDGAR, the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, is the primary system for companies
and others submitting documents under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
85
search for and process the information to compare cybersecurity risks across registrants.
Additionally, such disclosure might not be preserved on the company’s website for as long as it
would be when the disclosure is filed with the Commission, because companies may not keep
historical information available on their websites indefinitely. They also may go out of business,
and thus there could be information loss to investors when disclosures are deleted from websites.
Therefore, this approach would be less beneficial to investors, other market participants, and the
overall efficiency of the market.
2. Disclosure through Form 10-Q and Form 10-K
We also considered requiring disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents through Form
10-Q or Form 10-K instead of Form 8-K. Reporting material cybersecurity incidents at the end
of the quarter or year would allow registrants more time to assess the financial impact of such
incidents. The resulting disclosure might be more specific or informative for investors and other
market participants to value the securities and make more informed decisions. The compliance
costs would be less under this alternative, because registrants would not have an obligation to file
Form 8-K. With lower compliance costs under this alternative, registrants could use the
resources that would go towards disclosure on Form 8-K to instead fill gaps in their
cybersecurity defenses exposed by the attack, potentially making it less likely that malicious
actors would be able to exploit such vulnerabilities.
However, it would lead to less timely reporting on material cybersecurity incidents. As a
result, the market would not be able to incorporate the information related to cybersecurity risk
into the security prices in as timely a manner, and investors and other market participants would
not be able to make as informed decisions as they could under the proposed approach.

and the Investment Company Act. EDGAR’s public database can be used to research a public company’s
financial information and operations.
86
3. Exempt Smaller Reporting Companies
We also considered exempting smaller reporting companies from proposed Item 106 and
Item 407, because smaller companies might incur a cost that is disproportionally high, compared
to larger companies under the proposed rules. As discussed above, proposed disclosure might
expose registrants’ cybersecurity weakness and increase their vulnerability. To avoid the
potential exposure, smaller companies might increase spending related to cybersecurity risk
management measures, which could be disproportionately costly. Also, to the extent that they do
not have similar disclosure practices in place currently, it might be relatively more costly for
smaller companies to implement the proposed disclosure requirements than larger companies,
because they may have fewer resources.
However, evidence suggests that smaller companies may have an equal or greater risk
than larger companies of being attacked, making the proposed disclosures particularly important
for their investors.
163 The financial impact from an attack could also be more detrimental for
smaller companies than for larger ones. To the extent that one indirect effect of the proposed
disclosure may be that companies take additional steps to address potential vulnerabilities or
enhance their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, any resulting reduction
in vulnerability may be particularly beneficial for smaller companies and their investors.
4. Modify Scope of Inline XBRL Requirement
We also considered changing the scope of the proposed tagging requirements, such as by
excluding certain subsets of registrants. For example, the proposed tagging requirements could
have excluded asset-backed securities issuers, which are not currently required to tag any filings
 163 See supra note 18.
87
in Inline XBRL.164 Under such an alternative, asset-backed securities issuers would submit their
cybersecurity disclosures in unstructured HTML or ASCII, and thereby avoid the initial Inline
XBRL implementation costs (such as the cost of training in-house staff to prepare filings in
Inline XBRL, and the cost to license Inline XBRL filing preparation software from vendors) and
ongoing Inline XBRL compliance burdens that would result from the proposed tagging
requirement.165 However, narrowing the scope of the proposed tagging requirements, whether
based on registrant type, size, or other criteria, would diminish the extent of any informational
benefits that would accrue as a result of the proposed disclosure requirements by making the
excluded registrants’ cybersecurity disclosures comparatively costlier to process and analyze.
Request for Comment
We request comment on all aspects of our economic analysis, including the potential
costs and benefits of the proposed rules and alternatives thereto, and whether the proposed rules,
if adopted, would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation or have an impact on
investor protection. In addition, we also seek comment on alternative approaches to the
proposed rules and the associated costs and benefits of these approaches. Commenters are
requested to provide empirical data, estimation methodologies, and other factual support for their
views, in particular, on costs and benefits estimates. Specifically, we seek comment with respect
to the following questions:
 164 See supra note 157.
165 See infra section IV. The Commission’s EDGAR electronic filing system generally requires filers to use ASCII
or HTML for their document submissions, subject to certain exceptions. See EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II)
version 60 (December 2021), at 5-1; 17 CFR 232.301 (incorporating EDGAR Filer Manual into Regulation ST). See also 17 CFR 232.101 (setting forth the obligation to file electronically on EDGAR). To the extent
asset-backed securities issuers are affiliated with registrants that are subject to Inline XBRL requirements, they
may be able to leverage those registrants’ existing Inline XBRL tagging experience and software, which would
mitigate the initial Inline XBRL implementation costs that asset-backed securities issuers would incur under the
proposal.
88
41. What are the economic effects of the proposed cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity risk
management, strategy, and governance disclosures? Would those disclosures provide
informational benefits to investors? Would registrants benefit from a potential decrease in
cost of capital because of the enhanced disclosure? Are there any other benefits, costs, and
indirect effects of the proposed disclosure that we should also consider?
42. Would the proposed cybersecurity incident disclosure provide enough information for
investors to assess the impact of a cybersecurity incident in making an investment decision?
Because the proposed incident disclosure would not require quantification of an incident’s
impact, would the lack of quantification create any uncertainty for investors which may cause
them to under or overreact to the disclosure? Would investors benefit more if registrants
were to provide the disclosure after the incident’s impact is quantified or can be reasonably
estimated? If so, what metrics should be disclose to help investors understand the impact?
43. Would both types of the proposed disclosure, cybersecurity incident disclosure and
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure, increase the
vulnerability of registrants to cybersecurity incidents? Would this effect be mitigated by any
of the other effects of the proposal, including indirect effects such as registrants’ potential
strengthening of cybersecurity risk management measures? What would be the impact of the
proposed disclosure on the likelihood of future incidents for registrants? Would that impact
be the same for both types of disclosure?
44. Would the proposed incident disclosure increase registrants’ compliance costs to fulfill the
proposed disclosure requirements related to incident reporting? What would be the
magnitude of those costs? Would the proposed cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and
governance disclosure lead to indirect costs such as hiring a board member or staff to their
89
management team with cybersecurity expertise, or costs to devise, implement or improve the
processes and procedures related to cybersecurity?
45. Would both types of the proposed disclosure lead to indirect economic effects for external
stakeholders? Would the magnitude of the indirect effects be greater or less than we have
discussed? Are there any other indirect effects that we should consider?
46. Are there any specific data points that would be valuable for assessing the economic effects
of the proposed cybersecurity incident and risk management, strategy, and governance that
we should consider in the baseline analysis or the analysis of the economic effects? If so,
please provide that data.
47. Would any of the economic effects discussed above be more or less significant than in our
assessment? Are any of the costs or benefits identified incorrectly for any of the proposed
amendments? Are there any other economic effects associated with these proposed rules that
we should consider? Are you aware of any data or methodology that can help quantify the
benefits or costs of the proposed amendments?
48. Would any of the proposed amendments positively affect efficiency, competition and capital
formation as we have discussed? Are there any other effects on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation that we should consider?
49. Would any of the proposed amendments have disproportionate costs for smaller reporting
companies? Do smaller reporting companies face a different set of cybersecurity risks than
other companies?
50. Are there any other alternative approaches to improve disclosure of material cybersecurity
incidents, cybersecurity risk management, strategy, or governance that we should consider?
90
If so, what are they and what would be the associated costs or benefits of these alternative
approaches?
51. Are there any other costs and benefits associated with alternative approaches that are not
identified or are misidentified in the above analysis? Should we consider any of the
alternative approaches outlined above instead of the proposed rules? Which approach and
why?

A. Summary of the Collection of Information
Certain provisions of our rules and forms that would be affected by the proposed
amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).166 The Commission is submitting the proposed
amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with
the PRA.167 The hours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms constitute
reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. An agency may not
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to comply with, a collection of information
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Compliance with the information
collections is mandatory. Responses to the information collections are not kept confidential and
there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed. The titles for the affected

* All of these burden estimates incorporate the proposed tagging requirements Rule 405 of Regulation S-T.
** We estimate that 600 of these filings will be increased by five hours due to the proposed Item 106(d) disclosure.
± The burden estimate for Form 10-K assumes that Schedules 14A and 14C would be the primary disclosure
documents for the information provided in response to proposed Item 407(j) of Regulation S-K in connection
with proxy and information statements involving the election of directors. In this case, we assume that the
disclosure would be incorporated by reference in Form 10-K from the proxy or information statement.
93
Not every filing on the affected current forms, Form 6-K and Form 8-K, would include
cybersecurity disclosures. These disclosures would be required only when a registrant has made
the determination that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Further, in the case
of Form 6-K, the registrant would only have to provide the disclosure if it is required to disclose
such information elsewhere.
The table below sets forth our estimates of the number of current filings on the forms
which will be affected by the proposed rules. We used this data to extrapolate the effect of these
changes on the paperwork burden for the listed periodic reports.168

Below we estimate the incremental and aggregate changes in paperwork burden as a
result of the proposed amendments. These estimates represent the average burden for all

respondents, both large and small. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens will
likely vary among individual respondents based on a number of factors, including the nature of
their business.
We calculated the additional burden estimates by multiplying the estimated additional
burden per form by the estimated number of responses per form. That additional burden is then
added to the existing burden per form. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is to be allocated
between internal burden hours and outside professional costs. PRA Table 4 below sets forth the
percentage estimates we typically use for the burden allocation for each collection of information
and the estimated burden allocation for the proposed new collection of information. We also
estimate that the average cost of retaining outside professionals is $400 per hour.169

 169 We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would be an average of
$400 per hour. This estimate is based on consultations with several issuers, law firms, and other persons who
regularly assist issuers in preparing and filing reports with the Commission.

Request for Comment
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), we request comment in order to:
• Evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper
performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information
will have practical utility;
• Evaluate whether the Commission’s estimates of the burden of the proposed
collection of information are accurate;
• Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected;
• Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collection of
information on those who respond, including through the use of automated collection
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
• Evaluate whether the proposed amendments would have any effects on any other
collection of information not previously identified in this section.
Any member of the public may direct to us any comments concerning the accuracy of
these burden estimates and any suggestions for reducing these burdens. Persons submitting
comments on the collection of information requirements should direct their comments to the
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and send a copy to Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, with reference to File No. S7-09-22.
Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to the collection of
information requirements should be in writing, refer to File No. S7-09-22 and be submitted to the
98
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE,
Washington DC 20549. OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collection of
information requirements between 30 and 60 days after publication of the proposed amendments.
Consequently, a comment to OMB is best assured of having its full effect if the OMB receives it
within 30 days of publication.
V. SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”),170 the Commission must advise OMB as to whether the proposed amendments
constitute a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it
results or is likely to result in:
• An annual effect on the U.S. economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an
increase or a decrease);
• A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individuals industries; or
• Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.
We request comment on whether the proposed amendments would be a “major rule” for
purposes of SBREFA. In particular, we request comment on the potential effect of the proposed
amendments on the U.S. economy on an annual basis; any potential increase in costs or prices for
consumers or individual industries; and any potential effect on competition, investment or
innovation. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for
their views to the extent possible.

VI. INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
When an agency issues a rulemaking proposal, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”)171
requires the agency to prepare and make available for public comment an Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) that will describe the impact of the proposed rule on small
entities.172 This IRFA relates to proposed amendments and/or additions to the rules and forms
described in Section II above.
A. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action
The proposed amendments are intended to provide enhanced disclosures regarding
registrants’ cybersecurity risk governance and cybersecurity incident reporting. They are
designed to better inform investors about material cybersecurity risks and incidents on a timely
basis and a registrant’s assessment, governance, and management of those risks. The proposed
amendments are discussed in more detail in Section II above. We discuss the economic impact
and potential alternatives to the amendments in Section III, and the estimated compliance costs
and burdens of the amendments under the PRA in Section IV above.
B. Legal Basis
The amendments contained in this release are being proposed under the authority set
forth in Securities Act Sections 7 and 19(a) and Exchange Act Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 14, 15, and
23(a).
C. Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rules
The proposed amendments would apply to registrants that are small entities. The
Regulatory Flexibility Act defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small organization,”
 171 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
172 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
100
or “small governmental jurisdiction.”173 For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, under
our rules, a registrant, other than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small
organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal
year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities that does not exceed $5
million.174 Under 17 CFR 270.0-10, an investment company, including a BDC, is considered to
be a small entity if it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related
investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal
year.175 An investment company, including a BDC,
176 is considered to be a “small business” if
it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment companies,
has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year.177 Commission
staff estimates that, as of June 2021, there were 660 issuers,178 and 9 BDCs179 that may be
considered small entities that would be subject to the proposed amendments.
D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements
If adopted, the proposed amendments would apply to small entities to the same extent as
other entities, irrespective of size. Therefore, we expect that the nature of any benefits and costs
associated with the proposed amendments to be similar for large and small entities. Accordingly,
 173 5 U.S.C. 601(6).
174 See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).
175 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).
176 BDCs are a category of closed-end investment company that are not registered under the Investment Company
Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48) and 80a-53-64].
177 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).
178 This estimate is based on staff analysis of Form 10-K filings on EDGAR, or amendments thereto, filed during
the calendar year of Jan. 1, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2020, or filed by Sept. 1, 2021, and on data from XBRL filings,
Compustat, and Ives Group Audit Analytics.
179 These estimates are based on staff analysis of Morningstar data and data submitted by investment company
registrants in forms filed on EDGAR as of June 30, 2021.
101
we refer to the discussion of the proposed amendments’ economic effects on all affected parties,
including small entities, in Section III above. Consistent with that discussion, we anticipate that
the economic benefits and costs likely could vary widely among small entities based on a
number of factors, such as the nature and conduct of their businesses, which makes it difficult to
project the economic impact on small entities with precision. As a general matter, however, we
recognize that the costs of the proposed amendments borne by the affected entities could have a
proportionally greater effect on small entities, as they may be less able to bear such costs relative
to larger entities.
Compliance with the proposed amendments may require the use of professional skills,
including legal skills. We request comment on how the proposed disclosure amendments would
affect small entities.
E. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules
The Commission has also proposed cybersecurity risk management rules and related rule
amendments for advisers and funds, including BDCs. To the extent that the proposed rules and
rule amendments in the Investment Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release are adopted,
BDCs may be subject both to those proposed rules and rule amendments and to certain of the
rules proposed in this rulemaking. To the extent that there could be overlap if these proposals
are adopted, we would not expect the overlap to result in significant burdens for BDCs
(including small BDCs) since they should be able to use their Form 8-K disclosure to more
efficiently prepare the corresponding disclosure that would be required by the Investment
Management Cybersecurity Proposing Release or, in the alternative, use that corresponding
disclosure (if adopted) to prepare their Form 8-K disclosure.
102
F. Significant Alternatives
The RFA directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish our stated objectives,
while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small entities. In connection with the
proposed amendments, we considered the following alternatives:
• Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements that take into account the
resources available to small entities;
• Exempting small entities from all or part of the requirements;
• Using performance rather than design standards; and
• Clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements
under the rules for small entities.
The proposed amendments are intended to better inform investors about cybersecurity
incidents and the cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance of registrants of all
types and sizes which are subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements. Under current
requirements, the nature of registrants’ cybersecurity disclosure varies widely, with registrants
providing different levels of specificity regarding the cause, scope, impact and materiality of
cybersecurity incidents. The timing of disclosure about material cybersecurity incidents also
varies in the absence of a specific requirement regarding timely disclosure of such incidents.
Further, while registrants generally discuss cybersecurity risks in the risk factor section of their
annual reports, the disclosures are sometimes blended with other unrelated disclosures, which
makes it more difficult for investors to locate, interpret, and analyze the information provided.
The staff also has observed a divergence in these disclosures by industry and that smaller
reporting companies generally provide less cybersecurity disclosure as compared to larger
registrants.
103
Exempting small entities from the proposed amendments or establishing different
compliance or reporting requirements for small entities could frustrate the goal of providing
investors in these companies with more uniform and timely disclosure about material
cybersecurity incidents and disclosure about their risk management and governance practices
that is comparable to the disclosure provided by other registrants. Further, as stated in Sections
II and III of this release, evidence suggests that smaller companies may have an equal or greater
risk than larger companies of being attacked, making the proposed disclosures particularly
important for investors in these companies.180 Therefore, our objectives would not be served by
establishing different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or clarifying,
consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for small entities.
With respect to using performance rather than design standards, the proposed
amendments use primarily use design rather than performance standards to promote more
consistent and comparable disclosures by all registrants.
Section II of this release includes specific requests for comment on whether certain
categories of registrants, including smaller reporting companies, should be exempted from the
proposed Regulation S-K Item 106 disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy
and governance. The release also requests comment on how any exemption would impact
investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants. In addition,
comment is solicited on whether smaller reporting companies should be exempted from the
board expertise disclosure requirement in proposed Item 407(j) and from the requirements to
present the proposed disclosure in Inline XBRL.
 180 See supra note 18. See Section III.E.3.
104
Request for Comment
We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this IRFA. In
particular, we request comments regarding:
• The number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed amendments;
• The existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed amendments on small
entities discussed in the analysis;
• How the proposed amendments could further lower the burden on small entities; and
• How to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.
Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any impact and provide empirical data
supporting the extent of the impact. Comments will be considered in the preparation of the Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed amendments are adopted, and will be placed in
the same public file as comments on the proposed amendments themselves.
STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND TEXT OF PROPOSED RULE AND FORM
AMENDMENTS

and managing cybersecurity risk, specifically the prevention, mitigation, detection, and
remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and the relevant expertise of such persons or members in
such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise;
(ii) Whether the registrant has a designated chief information security officer, or someone
in a comparable position, and if so, to whom that individual reports within the registrant’s
108
organizational chart, and the relevant expertise of any such persons in such detail as necessary to
fully describe the nature of the expertise;
(iii) The processes by which such persons or committees are informed about and monitor
the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents; and
(iv) Whether and how frequently such persons or committees report to the board of
directors or a committee of the board of directors on cybersecurity risk.
Instructions to Item 106(c): 1. In the case of a foreign private issuer with a two-tier board of
directors, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term board of directors means the
