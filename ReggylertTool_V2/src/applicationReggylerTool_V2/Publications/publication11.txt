Shortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) proposes rules to
shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from two business days
after the trade date (“T+2”) to one business day after the trade date (“T+1”). To facilitate a T+1
standard settlement cycle, the Commission also proposes new requirements for the processing of
institutional trades by broker-dealers, investment advisers, and certain clearing agencies. These
requirements are designed to protect investors, reduce risk, and increase operational efficiency.
The Commission proposes to require compliance with a T+1 standard settlement cycle, if
adopted, by March 31, 2024. The Commission also solicits comment on how best to further
advance beyond T+1.
DATES: Comments should be received on or before April 11, 2022.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission proposes rules to shorten the
standard settlement cycle to T+1 and improve the processing of institutional trades by brokerdealers, investment advisers, and certain clearing agencies. First, the Commission proposes to
amend 17 CFR 240.15c6-1 (“Rule 15c6-1”) to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most
broker-dealer transactions from T+2 to T+1 and to repeal the T+4 standard settlement cycle for
firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m.,
1 as discussed in Part III.A. Second, the
Commission proposes 17 CFR 240.15c6-2 (“Rule 15c6-2”) to prohibit broker-dealers from
entering into contracts with their institutional customers unless those contracts require that the
parties complete allocations, confirmations, and affirmations by the end of the trade date, a
practice the securities industry has commonly referred to as “same-day affirmation,” as discussed
in Part III.B. Third, the Commission proposes to amend 17 CFR 275.204-2 (“Rule 204-2”) to
require investment advisers that are parties to contracts under Rule 15c6-2 to make and keep
records of their allocations, confirmations, and affirmations described in Rule 15c6-2, as
discussed in Part III.C. Fourth, the Commission proposes 17 CFR 240.17Ad-27 (“Rule 17Ad27”) to require a clearing agency that is a central matching service provider (“CMSP”) to
establish policies and procedures to facilitate straight-through processing, as discussed in Part
III.D. To assess and manage the potential impact of a T+1 settlement cycle, the Commission is

securities to which Rule 15c6-1 applies, which includes equities, corporate bonds, unit
investment trusts (“UITs”), mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), American
Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), security-based swaps, and options).

also soliciting comment on the following Commission rules and regulations: Regulation SHO;
the financial responsibility rules for broker-dealers; requirements in 17 CFR 240.10b-10 (“Rule
10b-10”); and requirements related to prospectus delivery. The Commission proposes to require
compliance with each of the proposed rules and rule amendments by March 31, 2024. The
Commission solicits comment on this proposed compliance date in Part III.F.
In addition, accelerating beyond a T+1 settlement cycle to a same-day standard
settlement cycle (i.e., settlement no later than the end of trade date, or “T+0”) is an objective that
the Commission is actively assessing; however, the Commission is not proposing rules to require
a T+0 standard settlement cycle at this time. In Part IV, the Commission discusses and requests
comment regarding potential pathways to T+0, as well as certain challenges to implementing
T+0 that have been identified by market participants. The comments received will be used to
inform any future action to further shorten the settlement cycle beyond T+1.

I. Introduction
In the 1920s, capital markets maintained a one-day settlement cycle for transactions in
securities.2
 Over the course of the twentieth century, the length of the settlement cycle grew to
five days—a response to the ever-growing number of investors, the rising volume of
transactions, and the increasing complexity of the processing infrastructure necessary to facilitate
the settlement of those transactions.3
 Since the late 1980s, the Commission, seeking to protect
investors and reduce risk, has been working with the securities industry to minimize the time it
takes for securities transactions to settle. The first initiative to shorten the standard settlement
cycle emerged following studies by government and industry groups after the October 1987
market break, including the Report of the Bachmann Task Force on Clearance and Settlement
Reform in U.S. Securities Markets.
4
 The Bachmann Report presented multiple

Securities Markets, Submitted to The Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (May 1992) (“Bachmann Report”), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1992-
06-22/pdf/FR-1992-06-22.pdf. The task force was headed by John W. Bachmann, the Managing

recommendations to improve the securities market by improving the safety and soundness of the
National C&S System.
5
 The Bachmann Report, submitted to the Commission in May 1992,
recommended that by 1994 the Commission shorten the standard settlement cycle from five days
to three days.
To support its recommendation, the Bachmann Report used the concept “time equals
risk” to illustrate that “less time between a transaction and its completion reduces risk.”6
 In
addition, the report stated that a “shorter settlement cycle will also uncover potential problems
sooner, before they mushroom or begin to cascade throughout the industry.”7
 In recommending
that the Commission shorten the standard settlement cycle, the Bachmann Report also stated,
“[t]he system and legal initiatives necessary to accomplish the T+3 settlement for corporate and
municipal securities should serve as a stepping stone to further reductions in settlement periods
over time as technology and systems permit.”8

Principal of Edward D. Jones & Co. of St. Louis, Missouri. The recommendations in the
Bachmann Report were intended to help inform the Commission’s approach to considering
reforms of the national system for clearance and settlement (“National C&S System”).
5 See id.
6 See id. at 4. Specifically, the concept posits that the length of time between the execution
and settlement of a securities transaction correlates to the financial risk exposure inherent in the
transaction, and that shortening this length of time can reduce the overall risk exposure.
7 Id.
8 Id. at 6.

In 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6-1 to shorten this process by requiring the
settlement of most securities transactions within three business days (“T+3”),
9 and in 2017, the
Commission amended the rule to require settlement within two business days (“T+2”).
10 The
Commission believes that further shortening of the settlement cycle would promote investor
protection, reduce risk, and increase operational efficiency. This view has been informed by two
recent episodes of increased market volatility—in March 2020 following the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and in January 2021 following heightened interest in certain “meme”
stocks. These two episodes have highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. securities
market that shortening the standard settlement cycle could help mitigate.
11 Accordingly, the
Commission is proposing a transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle. The Commission also
believes that achieving settlement by the end of trade date (“T+0”) could benefit investors as
well.12 While the Commission is not proposing a T+0 standard settlement cycle at this time, the

Adopting Release”). In adopting Rule 15c6-1, the Commission set a compliance date of June 1,
1995.

11 See, e.g., Staff Report on Equity and Options Market Structure Conditions in Early 2021

regulation, or statement of the Commission. The Commission has neither approved nor
disapproved its content. This report, like all staff reports, has no legal force or effect: it does not
alter or amend applicable law, and it creates no new or additional obligations for any person.
12 In this release, the Commission uses “T+0” to refer to a settlement cycle that is complete
by the end of the day on which the trade was executed (“trade date”). This is sometimes referred
to as “same-day” settlement and is distinct from real-time settlement, which contemplates
settlement in real time or near real time (i.e., immediately following trade execution) on a gross
basis. See infra Part IV (further discussing the concept of “T+0” as used in this release, as well
10
Commission would like to better understand the challenges that market participants may need to
address and resolve to achieve T+0. Accordingly, the Commission solicits comments on
potential paths to and challenges associated with achieving a T+0 standard settlement cycle in
Part IV.
13
On December 1, 2021, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”),14 the
Investment Company Institute (“ICI”),15 the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association (“SIFMA”),
16 and Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”)17 published a report that
presented industry recommendations to implement a T+1 standard settlement cycle in the U.S.
18

as the related concepts of real-time settlement and rolling settlement, where trades are netted and
settled intraday on a recurring basis).
13 Part IV discusses potential paths to and challenges associated with implementing a T+0
settlement cycle. For example, activities that are linked to the length of the settlement cycle
include securities lending activities. See infra Part IV.B.6.
14 DTCC is the holding company for three registered clearing agencies: The Depository
Trust Company (“DTC”), the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), and the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”). It is also the holding company for DTCC ITP Matching
(US) LLC (“DTCC ITP Matching”), which operates a CMSP pursuant to an exemption from
registration as a clearing agency.
15 ICI is an association representing regulated funds globally, including mutual funds, ETFs,
closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts in the United States, and similar funds offered to
investors in jurisdictions worldwide.
16 SIFMA is a trade association for broker-dealers, investment banks, and asset managers
operating in the U.S. and global capital markets.

2021.pdf. See infra Part II.C (summarizing the recommendations in the T+1 Report).
11
The Commission has considered the potential requirements, benefits, and costs associated with
further shortening the standard settlement cycle in the U.S., and proposes to require that the
standard settlement cycle transition to T+1, if adopted, by March 31, 2024.
19 As the securities
industry considers how it would implement T+1, the Commission believes that market
participants also generally should consider investments in new technology or operations now that
can be effective over the long term at maximizing the benefits of risk reduction and improved
efficiency in post-trade processing that accompany shortening the settlement cycle, mindful of
efforts to shorten the settlement cycle beyond T+1.
In Part II, the Commission provides (i) a history of the key Commission and industry
efforts to shorten the standard settlement cycle, including past concerns related to T+1 and T+0
settlement cycles, (ii) an overview of the current state of post-trade processing in the market for
U.S. equity securities, and (iii) a summary of other recent market events related to this rule
proposal. In Part III, the Commission describes the rule proposals that are necessary to achieve
T+1. In Part IV, the Commission discusses the potential pathways and challenges associated
with implementing a standard T+0 settlement cycle and requests comment on any and all aspects
of achieving T+0.
II. Background
In developing the rule proposals included in this release, the Commission considered the
history related to shortening the standard settlement cycle, the current state of post-trade
processing in the U.S. equities market, and recent initiatives and market events that have focused
 19 See infra Part III.F (discussing the proposed compliance date). The T+1 Report
contemplates implementation of T+1 in the first half of 2024, and the Commission believes that
sufficient time is available to achieve T+1 by March 31, 2024, as discussed further in Part III.F.
12
attention in the securities industry and the public on the appropriate length of the standard
settlement cycle. Each of these is discussed further below.
A. Relevant History
The first industry-level engagement on T+1 began in the late 1990s and developed a
business case for using straight-through processing to achieve T+1,20 estimating that an industry
investment of $8 billion in improved settlement technologies and processes could reduce
settlement exposures by 67% and return $2.7 billion in annual savings. Implementation of the
building blocks described in the Securities Industry Association (“SIA”) Business Case Report
was postponed when improving operational resilience following the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 took priority,
21 although many of them were subsequently achieved.
In 2012, DTCC commissioned a new study that found moving to a T+2 settlement cycle
would be significantly less costly and take less time to implement than either an immediate or
gradual transition to T+1, while still delivering significant benefits with respect to reducing risks
and costs.
22 The BCG Study ruled out as infeasible at the time a settlement cycle with settlement
on trade date (i.e., T+0) “given the exceptional changes required to achieve it and weak support
 20 The term “straight-through processing” generally refers to processes that allow for the
automation of the entire trade process from trade execution through settlement without manual
intervention. See infra Part III.D.1 (further discussing the concept of straight-through
processing).
21 See SIA, T+1 Business Case Final Report (July 2000) (“SIA Business Case Report”),
https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/t1-business-case-final-report.pdf.
22 See The Boston Consulting Group (“BCG”), Cost Benefit Analysis of Shortening the
Settlement Cycle (Oct. 2012) (“BCG Study”),

ement_Cycle_October2012.pdf.

across the industry.”23 It concluded that a T+0 settlement cycle would face major challenges
with processes such as trade reconciliation and exception management, securities lending, and
transactions with foreign counterparties (especially where time zones are least aligned). It also
concluded that payment systems used for final settlement would need to be significantly altered
to enable transactions late in the day. The BCG Study noted that market participants were aware
that a T+2 settlement cycle could be accomplished through mere compression of timeframes and
corresponding rule changes but that implementing T+2 without certain building blocks would
limit the amount of savings that would be realized across the industry. The BCG Study further
concluded that moving to a T+1 settlement cycle would require new infrastructure to enable near
real-time trade processing and would also require transforming the securities lending and foreign
buyer processes.24
In 2014, DTCC, ICI, SIFMA, and other market participants formed an Industry Steering
Group (“ISG”) to facilitate a transition to T+2.25 The ISG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
published a white paper describing certain “industry-level requirements” and “sub-requirements”
that the ISG believed would be required for a successful migration to a T+2 settlement cycle.26

rather than “ISC” (“Industry Steering Committee,” the term used in the ISG White Paper) when
14
In conjunction with the ISG, Deloitte published in December 2015 a “T+2 Playbook” setting
forth the requested implementation timeline with milestones and dependencies, as well as
detailing “remedial activities” that impacted market participants should consider to prepare for
migration to T+2.27 The ISG White Paper also included an implementation timeline that targeted
the transition for the end of the third quarter of 2017.
In 2015, the Commission’s Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the
Commission pursue T+1 (rather than T+2), noting that retail investors would significantly
benefit from a T+1 standard settlement cycle.28 In the event that the Commission determined to
pursue a T+2 standard settlement cycle, the IAC recommended that the Commission work with
industry participants to create a clear plan for moving to T+1 shortly thereafter.29
The Commission amended Rule 15c6-1 in 2017 to shorten the standard settlement cycle
from T+3 to T+2 and set a compliance date for September 2017.
30 The Commission recognized
that the clearance and settlement process for securities transactions encompassed by the rule

referring to the T+2 effort so that this release clearly distinguishes between the ISC’s current
work on T+1, as reflected in the T+1 Report, supra note 18, from past work on T+2.

involved a number of market participants and entities whose functions and capabilities would be
impacted significantly by a change in the standard settlement cycle, and the Commission
considered these in its analysis supporting the move to T+2. Among these entities were the
NSCC and the DTC, which respectively operate the central counterparty (“CCP”) and central
securities depository (“CSD”) for transactions in U.S. equity securities,
31 three CMSPs,
32 and the
diverse population of market participants that depend on the clearance and settlement services
provided by NSCC, DTC, and the CMSPs. These market participants include but are not limited
to, retail and institutional investors, registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, exchanges,
alternative trading systems, service providers, and custodian banks.
In the T+2 Adopting Release, the Commission explained that a T+1 standard settlement
cycle could produce greater reductions in market, credit, and liquidity risk for market
participants than a move to T+2, but that shortening beyond T+2 would require significantly
larger investments in new systems and processes.33 In an effort to analyze, among other things,
the impacts of further shortening beyond T+2, the Commission directed Commission staff to

study the issue.34 As a result of the staff’s study and analysis of the settlement cycle, the
Commission believes that, among other things, improvements to institutional trade processing
are critical to promoting the operational efficiency necessary to facilitate a standard settlement
cycle shorter than T+2, as discussed further in Part III.B below.
B. Current State of Post-Trade Processing
In the T+2 Proposing Release, the Commission provided a detailed overview of posttrade processing for transactions in equity securities, including the roles of the CCP, the CSD,
and CMSPs.35 The Commission also provided a summary of the affected market participants—
investors, broker-dealers, prime broker-dealers (“prime brokers”), and custodian banks—and
described at a high level the different paths to settlement available depending on whether a
transaction involves a retail or institutional investor.
36 While this overview remains an accurate
summary of the post-trade process, the Commission recognizes that shortening the standard
settlement cycle beyond T+2 will require particular focus on improving institutional trade
processing.
To provide context for understanding the Commission’s rule proposals and the related
economic analysis that follows in this release, the Commission provides below an overview of
the current state of post-trade processing, including a brief summary of trade flows relevant to
the processing of institutional trades. As a general matter, investors often rely on securities
intermediaries to facilitate the clearance and settlement of their securities transactions. These

35 T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69243–46.
36 As in the T+2 Proposing Release, the distinction between “retail investor” and
“institutional investor” is made only for the purpose of illustrating the manner in which these
types of entities generally clear and settle their securities transactions.
17
intermediaries include broker-dealers, which maintain a securities account on the investor’s
behalf to facilitate purchases and sales of securities, and clearing agencies, which provide a range
of services designed to facilitate the clearance and settlement of a securities transaction. As
relevant to this release, a clearing agency may act as a CCP, a CSD, or a CMSP. The role of
each of these entities is explained further below.
1. Clearing Agencies – CCPs, CSDs, and CMSPs
As explained more fully in the T+2 Proposing Release,37 a CCP interposes itself between
the counterparties to a trade following trade execution, becoming the buyer to each seller and
seller to each buyer to ensure the performance of open contracts. One critical function of a CCP
is to eliminate bilateral credit risk between individual buyers and sellers. NSCC is a registered
clearing agency that provides CCP services for transactions in U.S. equity securities to its
members.38 NSCC facilitates the management of risk among its members using a number of
tools, which include: (1) novating and guaranteeing trades to assume the credit risk of the
original counterparties; (2) collecting clearing fund contributions from members to help ensure
 37 T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69243.
38 As discussed further in the T+2 Proposing Release, NSCC also provides CCP services for
other types of securities, including corporate bonds, municipal securities, and UITs. Id.
18
that NSCC has sufficient financial resources in the event that one of the counterparties defaults
on its obligations;39 and (3) netting to reduce NSCC’s overall exposure to its counterparties.40
As discussed further in Part V.B.1, CCP netting reduces risk in the settlement process by
reducing the overall number of obligations that must be settled. NSCC’s netting and accounting
system is called the Continuous Net Settlement System (“CNS”). NSCC accepts trades into
CNS for clearing from the nation’s exchanges and other trading venues, and it uses CNS to net
each NSCC member’s trades in each security traded that day to a single position for each
security, either long (i.e., the right to receive securities) or short (i.e., an obligation to deliver
securities). Throughout the day, NSCC records cash debit and credit data generated by its
members’ activities, and at the end of the processing day, NSCC nets the debits and credits to
produce one aggregate cash debit or credit for each member.41
While NSCC provides final settlement instructions to its members each day, the payment
for and transfer of securities ownership occurs at DTC, which serves as the CSD and settlement
system for U.S. equity securities. At the conclusion of each trading day, an NSCC member’s
 39 Commission rules require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain financial resources that cover a wide
range of foreseeable stress scenarios that include, but are not limited to, the default of the
participant family that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad22(e)(4)(iii).
40 These functions are discussed in more detail in the T+2 Proposing Release. See T+2
Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69243. Since publication of the T+2 Proposing Release,
NSCC has amended its rules to provide a trade guarantee as soon as NSCC has validated the
trade upon submission for clearing.
41 The operation of CNS is explained more fully in the T+2 Proposing Release. See id. at
69244.
19
short and long positions are compared against its corresponding DTC account to determine
whether securities are available for settlement. If securities are available, they will be transferred
to cover the NSCC member’s short positions. Specifically, on settlement date NSCC submits
instructions to DTC to deliver (i.e., transfer) securities positions for each security netted through
CNS to each NSCC member holding a long position in such securities. Cash obligations are
settled through DTC by one net payment for each NSCC member at the end of the settlement
day.42
As noted above, DTC is a CSD, which is an entity that holds securities for its participants
either in certificated or uncertificated (i.e., immobilized or dematerialized) form so that
ownership can be easily transferred through a book entry (rather than the transfer of physical
certificates) and provides central safekeeping and other asset services. Additionally, a CSD may
operate a securities settlement system, which is a set of arrangements that enables transfers of
securities, either for payment or free of payment, and facilitates the payment process associated
with such transfers. DTC serves as the CSD and settlement system for most U.S. equity
securities, providing custody and book-entry services.43 In accordance with its rules, DTC
accepts deposits of securities from its participants, credits those securities to the depositing
participants’ accounts, and effects book-entry transfer of those securities. DTC substantially
 42 The interaction between NSCC and DTC to achieve settlement is explained more fully in
the T+2 Proposing Release. See id. at 69245.
43 DTC’s role as CSD is discussed more fully in the T+2 Proposing Release. See id. at
69245–46. As of 2017, DTC retained custody of more than 1.3 million active securities issues
valued at $54.2 trillion, including securities issued in the U.S. and 131 other countries and
territories. See DTCC, Businesses and Subsidiaries: The Depository Trust Company (DTC),
https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/dtc. The corporate bond market
accounted for another $30 billion and the municipal bond market saw over $10 billion on
average traded every day in 2016. See SIFMA, T+2 Fact Sheet, https://www.sifma.org/wpcontent/uploads/2017/09/Sep-8-T2-Update-Fact-Sheet.pdf.
20
reduces the number of physical securities certificates transferred in the U.S. markets, which
significantly improves operational efficiencies and reduces risk and costs associated with the
processing of physical securities certificates.
In addition to a securities account at DTC, each DTC participant has a settlement account
at a clearing bank to record any net funds obligation for end-of-day settlement. Debits and
credits in the participant’s settlement account are netted intraday to calculate, at any time, a net
debit balance or net credit balance, resulting in an end-of-day settlement obligation or right to
receive payment. DTC nets debit and credit balances for participants who are also members of
NSCC to reduce fund transfers for settlement, and acts as settlement agent for NSCC in this
process. Settlement payments between DTC and DTC’s participants’ settlement banks are made
through the National Settlement Service (“NSS”) of the Federal Reserve System.44
CMSPs electronically facilitate communication among a broker-dealer, an institutional
investor or its investment adviser, and the institutional investor’s custodian to reach agreement
on the details of a securities trade.45 These entities emerged as a result of efforts by market
participants to develop a more efficient and automated matching process that continues to be
viewed as a necessary step in achieving straight-through processing for the settlement of
institutional trades.
 44 The relevance of NSS to achieving money settlement in a T+0 environment is discussed
in Part IV.B.3.
45 The role of the CMSP in facilitating settlement is discussed more fully in the T+2
Proposing Release. See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69246.
21
CMSPs provide the communication facilities to enable a broker-dealer and an
institutional investor to send messages back and forth that results in the agreement of the trade
details, generally referred to as an “affirmation” or “affirmed confirmation,” which is then sent to
DTC to effect settlement of the trade.46 In general, the formatting and content of messages used
to communicate confirmations and affirmations varies and may include use of, for example,
SWIFT, FIX, ISITC, or other formats. The delivery method of such messages also may vary
across market participants. The CMSP, by acting as a centralized hub, helps promote
standardization and facilitate communication.
In addition, a CMSP may offer a “matching” process by which it compares and
reconciles the broker-dealer’s trade details with the institutional investor’s trade details to
determine whether the two descriptions of the trade agree, at which point it can generate an
affirmation to effect settlement of the trade. As part of such process, the CMSP may offer
services that can assist with the automated identification of trades that do not match, allowing
market participants to identify errors and remediate any trade information that does not match.
2. Broker-Dealers
Broker-dealers are securities intermediaries that, among other things, may hold accounts
on behalf of investors to facilitate the purchase and sale of securities transactions. Brokerdealers that are direct members of clearing agencies are typically referred to as “clearing
brokers.” Clearing brokers must comply with the rules of the clearing agency, including but not
 46 Specifically, the CMSP will send the affirmed confirmations to DTC where the DTC
participants, who will deliver the securities, will authorize the trades for automated settlement.
22
limited to rules for operational and financial requirements.47 Broker-dealers that submit
transactions to a clearing agency through a clearing broker are typically referred to as
“introducing brokers.” In general, broker-dealers executing trades on a registered securities
exchange are required to clear those transactions through a registered clearing agency. Brokerdealers executing trades outside the auspices of a trading venue (e.g., on an internalized basis)
may clear through a clearing agency or may choose to settle those trades through mechanisms
internal to that broker-dealer.
3. Retail and Institutional Investors
As discussed in the T+2 Proposing Release, institutional investors are entities such as, but
not limited to, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, bank trust departments, and insurance
companies.48 Transactions involving institutional investors are often more complex than those
for and with retail investors due to the volume and size of the transactions, the entities involved
in facilitating the execution and settlement of the trade, including CMSPs, bank custodians, or
prime brokers, and the need to manage certain regulatory or business obligations.49 By contrast,
the settlement of retail investor trades generally occurs directly with the investor’s brokerdealer,50 without relying on a separate custodian bank or prime broker.
 47 The requirements for membership or participation established by the clearing agencies
are discussed more fully in the T+2 Proposing Release. See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note
30, at 69247.
48 Institutional investors also include employee-benefit plans, foundations, endowments,
insurance companies and registered investment companies (“RICs”) (of which mutual funds are
one type), among other investor types.
49 See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69247 (discussing the same).
50 As previously discussed, if the broker-dealer is an introducing broker-dealer, the brokerdealer may use a clearing broker-dealer to facilitate clearance and settlement. See id. (discussing
the same).
23
Institutional investors may choose to trade through an executing broker-dealer that clears
and settles its securities transactions using NSCC and DTC. However, depending on the size and
complexity of the trade and the number of trading partners involved in the transaction,
institutional investors may also choose to avail themselves of processes specifically designed to
address the unique aspects of their trades. Specifically, as described below, many institutional
trades settle on an allocated trade-for-trade basis through a custodian bank. Many hedge funds
settle their trades using prime brokers.
Below are diagrams that illustrate at a high level the typical path to settlement for retail
trades and institutional trades.
a) Retail Trades
In general, individual retail investors rely on their broker-dealers to execute trades on
their behalf as customers of their broker-dealers. As previously discussed, a broker-dealer may
choose to internalize a customer’s order using its own inventory of securities. However, the
broker-dealer may also take other steps, away from its customer, to deliver securities to its
customer’s account. Depending on how the broker-dealer executes such trades away from its
customer, these other trades may clear through a clearing agency or may settle bilaterally.
Retail investors may engage in “self-directed” trading. Figure 1 illustrates, at a high
level, the activities that take place for a self-directed retail trade. In this scenario, when a retail
investor places an order to trade with its counterparty, the counterparty—typically, the brokerdealer through which the retail investor holds its securities account—will execute the trade. The
counterparty will issue a trade confirmation identifying certain trade details, such as the
transaction type, the account information, the security and quantity of shares traded, the trade
24
and settlement dates, and the net amount of money to be received or paid at settlement.51 The
confirmation may also include other financial details, such as commissions, taxes, and fees. A
retail investor generally would review the information provided in the confirmation and contact
its broker-dealer to correct any errors. In the absence of errors, the broker-dealer can proceed
with settlement processing.
Figure 1. Trade processing from the perspective of a self-directed retail investor.
In some instances, self-directed retail trades and trades directed by an investment adviser
are executed together as part of a block trade initiated by an investment adviser, which could also
engage the use of a CMSP to communicate the allocations of the block trade to participating
 51 See infra Part III.B.1 (further discussing trade confirmations and distinguishing the
requirements with respect to a confirmation under existing Rule 10b-10 and a confirmation under
proposed Rule 15c6-2).
25
accounts.52 Further discussion of institutional trades and the use of block trades by institutional
investors follows below.
b) Institutional Trades
Institutional investors often engage a broker-dealer or another counterparty for trade
execution, and separately, a bank custodian to provide custodial safekeeping and asset servicing
for their investments.53 Because the counterparty and the custodian are different entities in this
scenario, additional steps are necessary to complete the post-trade process, as identified by the
black shapes in Figure 2. Specifically, the institutional investor or its investment adviser will
need to instruct the bank custodian on the details of each transaction and authorize the bank
custodian to settle the trade. The black shapes in Figure 2 also illustrate how the investor’s
counterparty generally will provide the institutional investor or investment adviser with
execution details prior to issuing a trade confirmation.54
Figure 2. Trade processing from the perspective of an institutional investor or its
investment adviser without the use of a CMSP.
 52 See supra Part II.B.1 (discussing the services provided by a CMSP); infra Part II.B.3.c)
(discussing block trades).
53 Some institutional investors use broker-dealers to custody their securities, and in such
cases their transactions will trade and settle as described in Figure 1. In this release, we have
grouped such circumstances under the retail investor scenario because of the similar transaction
flow.
54 An electronic copy of the execution details is sometimes referred to as a “notice of
execution.”
26
Institutional investors, along with their broker-dealers and bank custodians, may rely on
the services of a CMSP to transmit confirmations and affirmations or match the trade details to
prepare a trade for settlement. Alternatively, they may use other standardized messaging
protocols, such as FIX and SWIFT,55 to communicate trade information. Some market
participants, however, still rely on manual processes to communicate trade information, such as
through the use of fax machines or email, and may use Excel data files rather than standardized
 55 See T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 5.
27
data protocols.
56 Whichever the mechanism, achieving an affirmed confirmation by the end of
trade date is considered a securities industry best practice.57 According to data from DTCC,
however, only 68% of trades are affirmed on trade date.58 Figure 2 illustrates a scenario where
the institutional investor does not rely on a CMSP to complete the confirmation/affirmation
process.
For some institutional investors, such as hedge funds, a prime broker may act as both the
counterparty to the trade and the custodian of the securities. In this scenario, the institutional
investor or its investment adviser provides trade details to the prime broker, and the prime broker
will affirm the transaction to facilitate settlement. As a broker-dealer, the prime broker may also
use NSCC to clear the transaction. Generally, the Commission understands that the prime broker
will “disaffirm” a transaction if the institutional investor does not make margin payments
required of the investor by the prime broker.
c) Use of Block Trades
Investment advisers commonly trade in “blocks” to manage the accounts of their
institutional clients. In such a scenario, investment advisers aggregate the orders of multiple
 56 Protocols are the rules that govern the exchange or transmission of data and may refer to
the specific content and formatting of trade information (i.e., ISO15022, FIX, SWIFT or an
Excel template), the method for delivery trade information (i.e., file transfer protocol (FTP), SSH
file transfer protocol (SFTP), SWIFT, DTC ITP, email, etc.), or both. They may also refer to the
frequency of transmission, deadlines for data delivery, and whether data is sent for individual
trades or a group (or “batch”) of trades. Some delivery mechanisms may offer a hub-and-spoke
model for delivery, in which the sender delivers data to a central hub and the hub passes the data
on to identified recipients. Other delivery mechanisms are bi-lateral, in which the sender and
receiver have a direct communication with one another without transmission through a hub.

clients into a block for trade execution. After trade execution of the block order by the brokerdealer, the investment adviser will allocate securities within the block to the accounts of its
clients participating in the block, as reflected in Figure 3. These allocation instructions are
communicated to the broker-dealer so that the broker-dealer can generate a confirmation of the
trade details for each account for the investment adviser to affirm.

or its investment adviser.
C. Recent Initiatives and Market Events
Efforts to facilitate a settlement cycle shorter than T+2 began soon after the transition to a
T+2 standard settlement cycle had been completed. For example, DTCC announced two
29
initiatives in January 2018 to achieve additional operational and capital efficiencies, dubbed
“Accelerating Time to Settlement” and “Settlement Optimization.”59 Among other things, the
DTCC-owned clearing agencies have been exploring steps to modify their settlement process to
be more efficient, such as by introducing new algorithms to position more transactions for
settlement during the “night cycle” process (which currently begins in the evening of T+1) to
reduce the need for activity on the day of settlement. Portions of these two initiatives have been
submitted to the Commission and approved as proposed rule changes.60
More recently, periods of increased market volatility—first in March 2020 following the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and again in January 2021 following heightened interest in
certain “meme” stocks—highlighted the significance of the settlement cycle to the calculation of
financial exposures and exposed potential risks to the stability of the U.S. securities market.

(“DTCC Modernizing Paper”), https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/downloads/Thoughtleadership/modernizing-the-u-s-equity-markets-post-trade-infrastructure.pdf. These initiatives
are relevant to the discussion of T+0 building blocks related to netting and batch processing, as
discussed in Part IV.B.1 and Part IV.B.2.
60 See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 87022 (Sept. 19, 2019), 84 FR 50541 (Sept. 25,
2019) (order amending NSCC’s settlement guide to implement a new algorithm for night cycle
transactions); Exchange Act Release No. 87756 (Dec. 16, 2019), 84 FR 70256 (Dec. 20, 2019)
(order extending the implementation timeframe for the new algorithm for transactions processed
in the night cycle); Exchange Act Release No. 87023 (Sept. 19, 2019), 84 FR 50532 (Sept. 25,
2019) (order amending the CNS Accounting Operation of NSCC’s Rules & Procedures with
respect to receipt of securities from NSCC’s CNS System).
61 According to DTCC, on March 12, 2020, NSCC processed over 363 million market-side
transactions in equity securities, topping by 15% its prior peak set in October 2008 during the
financial crisis. On an average day, NSCC processes approximately 106 million market-side
transactions. DTCC, Advancing Together: Leading the Industry to Accelerated Settlement, at 4
(Feb. 2021) (“DTCC White Paper”), https://www.dtcc.com/-
/media/Files/PDFs/White%20Paper/DTCC-Accelerated-Settle-WP-2021.pdf.
30
Specifically, these two events have expanded a public debate over the length of the settlement
cycle, and whether a shorter settlement cycle could have reduced the impact of the market
volatility on investors by, among other things, reducing the length of time over which a brokerdealer member of NSCC is required to provide margin deposits with respect to a given
transaction, thereby also potentially reducing the size of the deposits required per portfolio to
manage the increased volatility.
In February 2021, DTCC published the DTCC White Paper stating that accelerating
settlement beyond T+2 may bring significant benefits to market participants but requires careful
consideration and a balanced approach so that settlement can be achieved as close to the trade as
possible without creating capital inefficiencies or introducing new, unintended consequences—
such as inadvertently reducing or eliminating the benefits and cost savings provided by
multilateral netting.62 DTCC suggested that shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 could occur
in the second half of 2023, and it estimated that a T+1 settlement cycle could reduce the
volatility component of NSCC margin requirements by up to 41%.
63 DTCC also contended that
achieving T+1 could be largely supported by using existing systems and available tools and
procedures.64 With respect to a T+0 settlement cycle, DTCC distinguished between netted T+0

value of payments that need to be exchanged each day by an average of 98%, and netting is
particularly important during times of heightened volatility and volume.

settlement and real-time gross settlement,
65 noting that in a netted settlement environment, trades
would be netted either during the day or prior to settlement at the end of the day; with real-time
gross settlement, trades would be settled instantaneously without netting. Currently, the DTCC
clearing agencies can facilitate settlement on either T+1 or T+0 pursuant to their rules and
procedures for accelerated settlement.66 The DTCC White Paper explained that DTCC’s
participants believe “the hurdles to T+0 settlement,” especially real-time gross settlement, are
“too great at this time.”67 Furthermore, DTCC noted that real-time gross settlement could
require trades to be funded on a trade-for-trade basis, eliminating the liquidity and risk-reduction
benefits of existing CCP netting processes.68 Additionally, DTCC indicated that over the past
year it has been working collaboratively with a cross-section of market participants to build
support for further shortening of the settlement cycle, and has outlined a plan to increase these
efforts to forge a consensus on setting a firm date and approach to achieving a transition to
T+1.69

32
Following publication of the DTCC White Paper, the securities industry formed an
Industry Steering Committee (“ISC”) and an Industry Working Group (“IWG”)70 with the intent
of developing industry consensus for an accelerated settlement cycle transition, including to
understand the impacts, evaluate the potential risks, and develop an implementation approach.
To support this effort, the ISC engaged Deloitte to facilitate the IWG’s analysis of the benefits
and barriers to moving to T+1, and coordinate with the industry on recommending solutions for
the transition.71 In April 2021, DTCC, ICI, and SIFMA issued a joint press release to announce
their collaboration “on efforts to accelerate the U.S. securities settlement cycle from T+2 to
T+1.”72
As stated above, on December 1, 2021, DTCC, SIFMA and ICI, together with Deloitte,
published the T+1 Report, which outlined the ISC’s recommendations for achieving a T+1
standard settlement cycle, and proposed transitioning to T+1 settlement by the second quarter of
2024.
73 These recommendations focused on the following topics: allocation and confirmation of
institutional trades, trade documentation, global settlement and FX markets, corporate actions,
 70 IWG participation consisted of over 800 subject matter advisors representing over 160
firms from buy- and sell-side firms, custodians, vendors, and clearinghouses. T+1 Report, supra

prime brokerage services, securities lending, settlement errors and fails, creation and redemption
of exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), equity and debt offerings, and regulatory requirements.74
In addition to presenting the ISC’s recommendations regarding the requirements for
moving to T+1, the T+1 Report stated that the IWG also considered the impacts and benefits of
moving to T+0 settlement.75 The ISC and IWG concluded, by consensus, that T+0 is not
achievable in the short term given the current state of the settlement ecosystem.76 The T+1
Report stated that a move towards a shortening of the settlement cycle to T+0 would require an
overall modernization of current-day clearance and settlement infrastructure, changes to business
models, revisions to industry-wide regulatory frameworks, and the potential implementation of
real-time currency movements to facilitate such a change.77 Additionally, the IWG indicated
that “adoption of such technologies would disproportionately fall on small and medium-sized
firms that rely on manual processing or legacy systems and may lack the resources to modernize
their infrastructure rapidly.”78 The T+1 Report also described several “key areas” that the IWG
concluded would be significantly impacted by a move to T+0 settlement. These areas included:
re-engineering of securities processing; securities netting; funding requirements for securities
transactions; securities lending practices; prime brokerage practices; global settlement; and

primary offerings, derivatives markets and corporate actions.79 The Commission is assessing
these challenges, and in Part IV, includes further discussion of them in requesting comment on
considerations related to T+0 settlement.
III. Proposals for T+1
The Commission is proposing the following rules to implement a T+1 standard
settlement cycle. First, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c6-1 to establish a standard
settlement cycle of T+1 for most broker-dealer transactions.80 In so doing, the Commission also
proposes to repeal Rule 15c6-1(c), which currently establishes a T+4 standard settlement cycle
for certain firm commitment offerings.
81 Second, the Commission proposes three additional
rules applicable, respectively, to broker-dealers, investment advisers, and CMSPs to improve the
efficiency of managing the processing of institutional trades under the shortened timeframes that
would be available in a T+1 environment. Specifically, the Commission proposes new Rule
15c6-2 to prohibit broker-dealers who have agreed with a customer to engage in an allocation,
confirmation or affirmation process from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or
sale of a security on behalf of that customer unless the broker-dealer has also entered into a
written agreement that requires the allocation, confirmation, affirmation to be completed as soon
as technologically practicable and no later than the end of the day on trade date in order to
complete settlement in the timeframes required under Rule 15c6-1(a). The Commission also
proposes to amend the recordkeeping obligations of investment advisers to ensure that they are
properly documenting their related allocations and affirmations, as well as retaining the
 79 Id. at 11.
80 See infra Part III.A.1.
81 See infra Part III.A.3.
35
confirmations they receive from their broker-dealers. Finally, the Commission proposes a
requirement for CMSPs to establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures designed to facilitate straight-through processing. Each proposal is discussed further
below.
In addition, the Commission also discusses the anticipated impact of T+1 on other
Commission rules and existing Commission guidance on Regulation SHO, the financial
responsibility rules for broker-dealers under the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-10, prospectus delivery,
and rules and operations of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”). Finally, the Commission
proposes to require compliance with each of the above rule proposals, if adopted, by March 31,
2024. The Commission is soliciting comment on all aspects of the proposals, and in each section
below also solicits comment on specific aspects of the proposed rules and rule amendments, the
anticipated impact on the other Commission rules noted above, and the proposed compliance
date.
A. Shortening the Length of the Standard Settlement Cycle
Existing Rule 15c6-1(a) under the Exchange Act provides that, unless otherwise
expressly agreed by the parties at the time of the transaction, a broker-dealer is prohibited from
entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted security,
government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or
commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the
second business day after the date of the contract.82 Rule 15c6-1(a) covers contracts for the
 82 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a).
36
purchase or sale of all types of securities except for the excluded securities enumerated in
paragraph (a)(1) of the rule. The definition of the term “security” in Section 3(a)(10) of the
Exchange Act covers, among others, equities, corporate bonds, UITs, mutual funds, ETFs,
ADRs, security-based swaps, and options.83 Application of Rule 15c6-1(a) extends to the
purchase and sale of securities issued by investment companies (including mutual funds),
84
private-label mortgage-backed securities, and limited partnership interests that are listed on an
exchange.85
 83 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10). Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), amended, among other things, the
definition of “security” under the Exchange Act to encompass security-based swaps. The
Commission in July 2011 granted temporary exemptive relief from compliance with certain
provisions of the Exchange Act, including Rule 15c6-1, in connection with the revision of the
Exchange Act definition of “security” to encompass security-based swaps. See Order Granting
Temporary Exemptions Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 In Connection With the
Pending Revision of the Definition of “Security” To Encompass Security-Based Swaps,
Exchange Act Release No. 64795 (July 1, 2011), 76 FR 39927, 39938–39 (July 7, 2011). This
temporary exemptive relief expired on February 5, 2020. See Order Granting a Limited
Exemption from the Exchange Act Definition of “Penny Stock” for Security-Based Swap
Transactions between Eligible Contract Participants; Granting a Limited Exemption from the
Exchange Act Definition of “Municipal Securities” for Security-Based Swaps; and Extending

Definition of “Security” to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, Exchange Act Release No. 84991
(Jan. 25, 2019), 84 FR 863 (Jan. 31, 2019) (extending the expiration date for the relevant portion
of the temporary exemptive relief to February 5, 2020); Order Extending Temporary Exemptions
from Exchange Act Section 8 and Exchange Act Rules 8c–1, 10b–16, 15a–1, 15c2–1 and 15c2–5

Swaps, Exchange Act Release No. 87943 (Jan. 10, 2020), 85 FR 2763 (Jan. 16, 2020) (allowing
the relevant portion of the temporary exemptive relief to expire on February 5, 2020).
84 The Commission applied Rule 15c6-1 to broker-dealer contracts for the purchase and sale
of securities issued by investment companies, including mutual funds, because the Commission
recognized that these securities represented a significant and growing percentage of brokerdealer transactions. See T+3 Adopting Release, supra note 9, at 52900.
85 With regard to limited partnership interests, the Commission excluded non-listed limited
partnerships due to complexities related to processing the trades in these securities and the lack
37
Rule 15c6-1(a) allows the parties to the trade to agree that settlement will take place later
than two business days after the trade date, provided that such an agreement is express and
reached at the time of the transaction.
86 This provision is sometimes referred to as the “override
provision.” When the Commission first adopted Rule 15c6-1(a), it stated that use of the override
provision “was intended to apply only to unusual transactions, such as seller’s option trades that
typically settle as many as sixty days after execution as specified by the parties to the trade at
execution.”87 The override provision in 15c6-1(a) continues to be intended to apply only to these
unusual transactions.88
Rule 15c6-1(b) provides an exclusion for contracts involving the purchase or sale of
limited partnership interests that are not listed on an exchange or for which quotations are not
disseminated through an automated quotation system of a registered securities association.89

of an active secondary market. In contrast, the Commission included listed limited partnerships
primarily to ensure exclusion of these securities would not unnecessarily contribute to the
bifurcation of the settlement cycle for listed securities generally. See id. at 52899.
86 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a).
87 T+3 Adopting Release, supra note 9, at 52902. In the T+2 Proposing Release, the
Commission stated its preliminary belief that the use of this provision should continue to be
applied in limited cases to ensure that the settlement cycle set by Rule 15c6-1(a) remains a
standard settlement cycle. T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69257 n.153.
88 To date, the Commission has not identified instances indicating a risk of overuse of this
provision.
89 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(b). In recognition of the fact that the Commission may not have
identified all situations or types of trades where T+2 settlement would be problematic, Rule
15c6-1(b) provides that the Commission may exempt by order additional types of trades from
T+2 settlement, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission
determines that such an exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of
investors. Id.
38
Pursuant to Rule 15c6-1(b), the Commission has granted an exemption from Rule 15c6-1 for
securities that do not have facilities for transfer or delivery in the U.S.
90 However, if the parties
execute a transaction on a registered securities exchange, the transaction will be subject to both
the rules of the exchange and Rule 15c6-1.91 Under the exemption, an ADR is considered a
separate security from the underlying security.92 Thus, if there are no transfer facilities in the
U.S. for a foreign security but there are transfer facilities for an ADR based on such foreign
security, only the foreign security will be exempt from Rule 15c6-1.93 The Commission has also
granted a separate exemption for contracts for the purchase or sale of any security issued by an
insurance company (as defined in Section 2(a)(17) of the Investment Company Act94) that is
funded by or participates in a “separate account” (as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the
Investment Company Act95), including a variable annuity contract or a variable life insurance
 90 See Exchange Act Release No. 35750 (May 22, 1995), 60 FR 27994, 27995 (May 26,
1995) (granting an exemption from Rule 15c6-1 for certain transactions in foreign securities).
The exemption also provides that if less than 10% of the annual trading volume in a security that
has U.S. transfer or deliver facilities occurs in the U.S., the transaction in such security will be
exempt from the requirements in the rule.

contract, or any other insurance contract registered as a security under the Securities Act of 1933
(“Securities Act”).
96
Rule 15c6-1(c) establishes a T+4 settlement cycle for firm commitment underwritings for
securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (“ET”).
97 Specifically, the rule states that
the standard settlement cycle set forth in Rule15c6-1(a) does not apply to contracts for the sale of
securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. ET on the date that such securities are priced and that are
sold by an issuer to an underwriter pursuant to a firm commitment offering registered under the
Securities Act or sold to an initial purchaser by a broker-dealer participating in such offering.
Under the rule, the broker or dealer must effect or enter into a contract for the purchase or sale of
those securities that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities no later than the
fourth business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the
parties at the time of the transaction.
Rule 15c6-1(d) provides that, for purposes of paragraphs (a) and (c) of the rule, parties to
a contract shall be deemed to have expressly agreed to an alternate date for payment of funds and
delivery of securities at the time of the transaction for a contract for the sale for cash of securities
pursuant to a firm commitment offering if the managing underwriter and the issuer have agreed
to such date for all securities sold pursuant to such offering and the parties to the contract have

1995) (granting an exemption from Rule 15c6-1 for transactions involving certain insurance
contracts). The Commission determined not to rescind or modify the exemptive order when it
shortened the settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2. See T+2 Adopting Release, supra note 10, at
15581.

40
not expressly agreed to another date for payment of funds and delivery of securities at the time of
the transaction.98
1. Proposed Amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)
The Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c6-1(a) to prohibit a broker-dealer from
effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted
security, a government security, a municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances,
or commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the
first business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties
at the time of the transaction.99 The Commission’s proposal to amend Rule 15c6-1(a) would
change only the standard settlement date for securities transactions covered by the existing rule,
and would not impact the existing exclusions enumerated in the rule. In addition, the
Commission’s proposal would retain the so-called “override provision,” and the Commission
continues to intend for the “override provision” to apply only to unusual cases to ensure that the
settlement cycle set by Rule 15c6-1(a) is in fact the standard settlement cycle.100
2. Basis for Shortening the Standard Settlement Cycle to T+1
First, the Commission preliminarily believes that market participants have made
substantial progress toward identifying the technological and operational changes that would be
necessary to establish a T+1 standard settlement cycle, and significant industry support for such
 98 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(d).
99 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a).
100 See supra note 88.
41
a move has emerged. By contrast, at the time the Commission proposed to shorten the standard
settlement cycle to T+2, market participants generally supported moving to T+2 and many
believed that moving to T+1 would be substantially more costly and take longer to achieve than
moving to T+2.101 At that time, neither the Commission nor the industry supported moving to a
T+1 standard settlement cycle.102 Since then, Commission staff has continued to study the
potential impact of further shortening the settlement cycle, and the ISC has recommended that
the securities industry implement a T+1 standard settlement cycle.103
The Commission acknowledges that a transition from a T+2 to T+1 standard settlement
cycle, and implementation of the necessary operational, technical, and business changes, will
likely result in varying burdens, costs and benefits for a wide range of market participants.104
The Commission has remained mindful and observant of industry initiatives and progress
targeted at facilitating an environment where a shortened standard settlement cycle could be
achieved in a manner that reduces risk for market participants while also minimizing the
likelihood of disruptive burdens and costs. Having taken current industry initiatives and their
relative progress into consideration, the Commission preliminarily believes there has been
collective progress by market participants sufficient to facilitate a transition to a T+1.
 101 See T+2 Adopting Release, supra note 10, at 15598–99.
102 See id. at 15572.
103 See supra notes 73–74 and accompanying text (discussing the recommendations in the
T+1 Report).
104 See infra Part V (analyzing the economic effects of shortening the standard settlement
cycle to T+1).
42
Furthermore, when the Commission adopted a T+2 standard settlement cycle, it identified
a number of incremental improvements to the functioning of the U.S. securities market likely to
result relative to a T+3 standard settlement cycle.105 The Commission preliminarily believes that
a T+1 settlement cycle would produce similar incremental improvements to the functioning of
the U.S. securities market relative to a T+2 settlement cycle. These benefits, discussed further in
Part V.C.1, are summarized briefly here.
First, as a general matter, time to settlement determines a significant portion of a market
participant’s risk exposure on a given securities transaction. As a result, all else being equal,
shortening the time to settlement reduces exposure to credit,106 market,107 and liquidity risk.108
In addition, assuming that trading volume remains constant, shortening the time to settlement
also decreases the total number of unsettled trades that exists at any point in time, as well as the
total market value of all unsettled trades.109 This reduction in the number and total value of
 105 See T+2 Adopting Release, supra note 10, at 15569–75.
106 Credit risk refers to the potential for the market participant’s counterparty to a given
transaction to default on the transaction and therefore the market participant will not receive
either the cash or securities necessary to settle the transaction.
107 Market risk refers to the potential for the value of the security that underlies the
transaction to change between trade execution and settlement.
108 Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the market participant will be unable to timely settle a
transaction because it does not have access to sufficient cash or securities. The market
participant may not have access to sufficient cash or securities for a given transaction if, for
example, it has recently been exposed to the default of a counterparty on a separate transaction
and did not receive the anticipated proceeds of that transaction.
109 In other words, a T+2 settlement cycle results in two days of unsettled transactions at any
given time, whereas a T+1 settlement cycle would result in one day of unsettled transactions at
any given time.
43
unsettled trades should correspond to a reduction in a market participant’s overall exposure to
risk arising from unsettled transactions.
Second, the above dynamics produce noticeable effects for transactions that are centrally
cleared because they reduce the CCP’s exposure to credit, market, and liquidity risk arising from
its obligations to its participants, promoting the stability of the CCP and thereby reducing the
potential for systemic risk to transmit through the financial system. For example, when the CCP
faces a participant default, the CCP will liquidate open positions of the defaulting participant and
use the defaulting participant’s financial resources held by the CCP to cover the CCP’s losses
and expenses. The CCP may face losses if the market value of the defaulting participant’s open
positions has moved significantly in the time between trade execution and default.
110 While the
CCP works to close out the defaulting participant’s open positions, it also needs to continue to
meet its end-of-day settlement obligations to non-defaulting participants, and so the CCP is
exposed to liquidity risk when a member defaults because it may need to use its own resources to
complete end-of-day settlement.
111 In each instance, the amount of risk to which the CCP is
 110 For example, if the open position is net long, to close the position the CCP would obtain
replacement securities in the market, possibly at a higher price than the original transaction.
Conversely, if the open position is net short, to close the position the CCP would sell the
defaulting participant’s securities in the market, possibly at a lower price than the original
transaction.
111 The costs associated with deploying such resources are ultimately borne by the CCP
members, both in the ordinary course of the CCP’s daily risk management process and in the
event of an extraordinary event where members may be subject to additional liquidity
assessments. These costs may be passed on through the CCP members to broker-dealers and
investors.
44
exposed is determined in part by the length of the settlement cycle, and shortening the settlement
cycle would reduce the CCP’s overall exposure to these risks.
Third, reducing these risks to the CCP would reduce the overall size of the financial
resources that the CCP requires of its participants,
112 thereby reducing the risks and costs faced
by the CCP participants (i.e., broker-dealers) and, by extension, their customers (i.e.,
investors).
113 CCP participants may choose to pass these reductions down to their customers.
Fourth, the Commission anticipates that the above effects would reduce the potential for
systemic risk.114 When the Commission proposed to shorten the standard settlement cycle from
T+3 to T+2 it explained that its “views are even more apt today given the increasing
interconnectivity and interdependencies among markets and market participants.”115 In
particular, in periods of market stress, liquidity demands imposed by the CCP on its participants,
 112 See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69251 n.77 (discussing mutual fund
settlement timeframes and related liquidity risk, which may be exacerbated during times of
stress). The Commission preliminarily believes that shortening settlement timeframes for
portfolio securities to T+1 will generally assist in reducing liquidity and other risks for funds that
must satisfy investor redemption requests that settle pursuant to shorter settlement timeframes
(e.g., T+1).
113 See id. at 69251.
114 As the Commission noted when it adopted Rule 15c6-1, reducing the total volume and
value of outstanding obligations in the settlement pipeline at any point in time will better insulate
the financial sector from the potential systemic consequences of serious market disruptions. See
T+3 Adopting Release, supra note 9, at 52894.
115 T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69258 n.160 (citing Exchange Act Release No.
68080 (Oct. 22, 2012), 77 FR 66220, 66254 (Nov. 2, 2012) (“Clearing Agency Standards
Adopting Release”) and DTCC, Understanding Interconnectedness Risks – To Build a More
Resilient Financial System (Oct. 2015),

45
such as in the form of intraday margin calls, can have procyclical effects that reduce overall
market liquidity.
116 Reducing the CCP’s liquidity exposure by shortening the settlement cycle
can help limit this potential for procyclicality,117 enhancing the ability of the CCP to serve as a
source of stability and efficiency in the national clearance and settlement system.118
Finally, shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 would enable investors to access
the proceeds of their securities transactions sooner than they are able to in the current T+2
environment. In particular, in a T+1 environment, sellers would have access to cash proceeds
one day sooner and buyers would see purchased securities in their accounts one day earlier
relative to a T+2 standard settlement cycle.
In addition, as noted above, the Commission has evaluated the potential for shortening
the settlement cycle to impose costs on market participants, which are likely to vary across
market participants depending on a number of facts. These costs and considerations are
discussed in Part V.C.2. The costs include those costs associated with investments in improved
operations and new technologies to manage the compression of time resulting from a shorter
settlement cycle. Shortening the settlement cycle may have other effects as well. For example,
 116 For a discussion regarding procyclicality, see T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at
69250–52.
117 See T+3 Adopting Release, supra note 9, at 52894.
118 See Standards for Covered Clearing Agencies, Exchange Act Release No. 71699 (Mar.
12, 2014), 79 FR 16865 (Mar. 26, 2014), corrected at 79 FR 29507, 29598 (May 22, 2014)
(“CCA Standards Proposing Release”). Clearing members are often members of larger financial
networks, and the ability of a covered clearing agency to meet payment obligations to its
members can directly affect its members’ ability to meet payment obligations outside of the
cleared market. Thus, management of liquidity risk may mitigate the risk of contagion between
asset markets.
46
shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 for equity securities would disconnect settlement
with foreign exchange (“FX”) transactions, which settle on a T+2 basis. Mismatched settlement
timeframes between equities and FX transactions may increase the cost needed to fund and
hedge related securities transactions.
119 In addition, the Commission recognizes that a disorderly
transition to a shorter settlement cycle could lead to an increase in settlement fails. However, as
discussed in Part V.B.4, in analyzing the shortening of the settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2, the
Commission found no marked change in the volume of such failures. The Commission
preliminarily believes that an orderly transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle can limit the
negative effects of settlement fails. The Commission also believes that facilitating an increase in
same-day affirmations helps mitigate the effects of settlement fails, as affirmations on trade date
can limit the potential for processing errors on settlement day that cause fails.
120 More generally,
the Commission preliminarily believes that the anticipated benefits of a shortened settlement
cycle justify the anticipated costs.
3. Proposed Deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c) and Conforming Technical
Amendments to Rule 15c6-1
As explained above, Rule 15c6-1(c) establishes a T+4 settlement cycle for firm
commitment offerings for securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. ET, unless otherwise
expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction. The Commission proposes to
delete this provision. Deleting Rule 15c6-1(c) would, in conjunction with the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), set a T+1 standard settlement cycle for firm commitment
 119 See infra Part V.C.2 (noting that market participants will have a choice between bearing
an additional day of currency risk or incurring the cost related to hedging away this risk in the
forward or futures market).
120 See infra Part III.B (proposing new Rule 15c6-2 to increase same-day affirmations); Part
V.C.1 (noting that the proposed rule can facilitate an orderly transition to T+1).
47
offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. ET. However, the so-called “override” provisions in paragraphs
(a) and (d) of Rule 15c6-1 would continue to allow contracts currently covered by paragraph (c)
to provide for settlement on a timeframe other than T+1 if the parties expressly agree to a
different settlement timeframe at the time of the transaction.
In proposing to delete paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1, the Commission also proposes
conforming amendments to paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of the rule. Specifically, the Commission
is proposing to delete all references to paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1 that currently appear in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of the rule.
4. Basis for Eliminating T+4 Standard for Certain Firm Commitment
Offerings
The Commission believes that expanded application of the “access equals delivery”
standard for prospectus delivery supports removing paragraph (c) from Rule 15c6-1 because
delays in the process that made delivery of the prospectus difficult to achieve under the standard
settlement cycle have been mitigated by the “access equals delivery” standard. In addition, if
paragraph (c) is removed as proposed, paragraph (d) would continue to provide underwriters and
the parties to a transaction the ability to agree, in advance of a particular transaction, to a
settlement cycle other than the standard set forth in Rule 15c6-1(a) when needed to manage
obligations associated with the firm commitment offering.
The Commission adopted paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 15c6-1 in 1995, two years after
Rule 15c6-1 was originally adopted.121 At the time, the rule included a limited exemption from
 121 See Prospectus Delivery; Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle, Exchange Act Release
No. 34-35705 (May 11, 1995), 60 FR 26604 (May 17, 1995) (“1995 Amendments Adopting
Release”).
48
the requirements under paragraph (a) of the rule for the sale for cash pursuant to a firm
commitment offering registered under the Securities Act.122 The exemption for firm
commitment offerings was added in response to public comments stating that new issue
securities could not settle on T+3 because prospectuses could not be printed prior to the trade
date (the date on which the securities are priced).123
When the Commission proposed to amend Rule 15c6-1 in 1995, it stated that, since the
adoption of the rule, members of the brokerage community had suggested the Commission
eliminate the exemption and ease the problems associated with prospectus delivery by other
means. The primary reasons expressed for requiring T+3 settlement of such offerings were: (i)
the secondary market for a new issue may be subject to greater price fluctuations or instability,
which in turn may expose underwriters, dealers and investors to disproportionate credit and
market risk; and (ii) the bifurcated settlement cycle created for initial sales and resales of new
issues would be disruptive to broker-dealer operations and to the clearance and settlement
system.124 In particular, it was explained that if a purchaser of a new issue sells on the first or
second day after pricing, the purchaser's broker will not be able to settle with the buyer's broker
on a T+3 schedule because the securities would not yet be available for settlement purposes.125
 122 The exemption was limited to sales to an underwriter by an issuer and initial sales by the
underwriting syndicate and selling group. Any secondary resales of such securities were to settle
on a T+3 settlement cycle. T+3 Adopting Release, supra note 9, at 52898.
123 Id.
124 See Exchange Act Release No. 34-35396 (Feb. 21, 1995), 60 FR 10724 (Feb. 27, 1995)
(“1995 Amendments Proposing Release”).
125 Id.
49
As a result, all such trades by the purchasers would “fail” and result in expense, inefficiencies,
and greater settlement risk for all participants. A bifurcated settlement cycle also may require
the maintenance of separate computer systems and additional internal procedures.
The vast majority of commenters submitting feedback in response to the 1995
Amendments Proposing Release supported T+4 as the standard settlement cycle for firm
commitment offerings price after 4:30 p.m.126 Several of these commenters reasoned that it is
difficult to print prospectuses within a T+3 timeframe when securities are priced late in the day.
These commenters also stated that the potential systemic and market risks associated with the
proposed T+4 provision should be limited because most secondary market trading in the subject
securities would not begin trading until the opening of the market on the next business day, and
therefore the primary issuance of securities would be available to settle secondary trading in the
security.127
The T+1 Report stated that paragraph (c) is rarely used in the current T+2 settlement
environment, but the IWG expects a T+1 standard settlement cycle would increase reliance on
paragraph (c).128 The T+1 Report further stated that the IWG recommends retaining paragraph
(c) but amending it to establish a standard settlement cycle of T+2 for firm commitment

offerings.129 The T+1 Report cited issues with respect to complex documentation and other
operational elements of equity offerings that may delay settlement to T+2 in a T+1 environment.
With respect to debt offerings, the T+1 Report stated that many such offerings frequently
rely on the exception provided in Rule 15c6-1(d).130 In describing the reasons debt offerings
“have historically needed, and will continue to need, this exemption if the standard settlement
cycle is moved to T+1,” the T+1 Report stated that such offerings are “document-intensive and
typically have more documentation than equity offerings.”131 According to the T+1 Report, this
documentation includes indentures, guarantees, and collateral documentation, all of which are
individually negotiated and unique to the transaction.132 Thus, the T+1 Report states, a
substantial portion of debt offerings settle later than T+3.133
While the Commission appreciates that documentation relating to firm commitment
offerings for equities must be completed prior to settlement of such transactions, the T+1 Report
did not explain why or how timely completion of such documentation would not be possible if
the exception in paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1 were eliminated. In contrast, the T+1 Report
states, as discussed above, that firm commitment offerings generally settle in alignment with the
standard settlement cycle. As the Commission is not currently aware of any data or facts
indicating that the documentation associated with firm commitment offerings cannot be
completed by T+1, the Commission preliminarily believes that the need to complete transaction

130 Id.

51
documentation prior to settlement does not justify proposing a separate standard settlement cycle
of T+2 for equity offerings. Rather, to the extent that documentation may in some cases require
more time to complete than is available under a T+1 standard settlement cycle, the parties to the
transaction can agree to a longer settlement period pursuant to paragraph (d) when they enter the
transaction. In this way, deleting paragraph (c) does not prevent the parties from using
paragraph (d) to agree to a longer settlement period; it only removes the presumption that such
firm commitment offerings should be subject to a different settlement cycle than the standard
settlement cycle set forth in paragraph (a).
In addition, as discussed further in Part III.E.4, 17 CFR 230.172 (“Rule 172”) has
implemented an “access equals delivery” model that permits, with certain exceptions, final
prospectus delivery obligations to be satisfied by the filing of a final prospectus with the
Commission, rather than delivery of the prospectus to purchasers. As a result of these changes,
broker-dealers generally would not require time to print and deliver prospectuses—a point
originally cited by many commenters in support of adopting paragraph (c) —and the
Commission preliminarily believes that broker-dealers are able to satisfy their obligations with
respect to these firm commitment offerings on a timeline much shorter than the current T+4
standard settlement cycle for these firm commitment offerings.
In addition, establishing T+1 as the standard settlement cycle for these firm commitment
offerings, and thereby aligning the settlement cycle with the standard settlement cycle for
securities generally, would reduce exposures of underwriters, dealers, and investors to credit and
market risk, and better ensure that the primary issuance of securities is available to settle
52
secondary market trading in such securities.134 The Commission believes that harmonizing the
settlement cycle for such firm commitment offerings with secondary market trading, to the
greatest extent possible, limits the potential for operational risk.
Therefore, in the Commission’s view, deleting paragraph (c) while retaining paragraph
(d) provides sufficient flexibility for market participants to manage the potential need for longer
than T+1 settlement on certain firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. that may
include “complex” documentation because paragraph (d) would continue to permit the
underwriters and the parties to a transaction to agree, in advance of entering the transaction,
whether T+1 settlement or some other settlement timeframe is appropriate for the transaction. In
addition, the Commission believes that having the underwriters and the parties to the transaction
agree in advance of entering the transaction whether to deviate from the standard settlement
cycle established in paragraph (a) would promote transparency among the parties, in advance of
 134 As noted above, prior to the Commission’s 1995 amendments to Rule 15c6-1 members of
the broker-dealer community expressed the view that (i) the secondary market for a new issue
may be subject to greater price fluctuations or instability, which in turn may expose underwriters,
dealers and investors to disproportionate credit and market risk; and (ii) a bifurcated settlement
cycle created for initial sales and resales of new issues would be disruptive to broker-dealer
operations and to the clearance and settlement system. See supra notes 124, 125, and
accompanying text. While these arguments were made by market participants when the standard
settlement cycle in the U.S. was still T+3, the Commission preliminarily believes that they
remain relevant to the Commission’s proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) and proposed
deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c). In particular, if the Commission were to adopt the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) without deleting Rule 15c6-1(c), a broker-dealer settling on behalf
of a customer who sells shares of a new issue on the first day after pricing might, in some cases,
not be able to settle with the purchaser’s broker-dealer because the securities may not yet be
available for settlement. Specifically, if the new issue settled on T+2 and the secondary market
transactions executed on the first day of trading settled on T+1, the primary issuance would
presumably not be available for timely settlement of the secondary market transactions.
Conversely, if the Commission adopts both the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) and the
proposed deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c), the settlement cycle would not be bi-furcated and the basis
for the above-described concerns raised previously by the broker-dealer community related to bifurcation of the settlement cycle would not be applicable.
53
entering the transaction, as to the length of the time that it takes to complete documentation with
respect to the transaction. The Commission requests comment on these views. To the extent that
commenters agree with the T+1 Report, the Commission requests that such commenters provide
data or other detailed information explaining why a T+1 settlement cycle is an inappropriate
standard for all firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m., such as an explanation or
description for what specific documentation cannot be completed consistent with a T+1
settlement cycle.
5. Request for Comment
The Commission is requesting comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to
Rule 15c6-1 to shorten the current T+2 and T+4 standard settlement cycles to T+1. The
Commission also solicits comment on the particular questions set forth below, and encourages
commenters to submit any relevant data or analysis in connection with their answers.
1. Should the Commission amend Rule 15c6-1 to shorten the standard settlement cycle to
T+1 as proposed? Why or why not?
2. Are efforts to shorten the standard settlement cycle to T+1 a logical step on the path to
T+0 settlement, or would shortening to T+1 require investments or processes that would
be outdated or unnecessary in a T+0 environment?135 Please explain why or why not.
3. Is the current scope of securities covered by Rule 15c6-1, including the exclusions
provided in the text of Rule 15c6-1(a), still appropriate in light of the Commission’s
proposal to shorten the standard settlement cycle to T+1? Are there any asset classes,
securities as defined in Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, or types of securities
 135 See supra note 12 and accompanying text (explaining that T+0 in this release is intended
to refer to netted settlement by the end of trade date); see also infra Part IV (discussing the
same).
54
transactions for which the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would present
compliance problems for broker-dealers? What would be the quantitative and qualitative
impacts of maintaining those exclusions?
4. The Commission requests that commenters provide information regarding securities
transactions that, in today’s T+2 settlement environment, generally settle later than T+2.
To what extent does this occur, and what are the circumstances that motivate market
participants to settle later than T+2? If Rule 15c6-1(a) is amended to shorten the standard
settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1, would market participants continue to settle such
securities transactions on a longer settlement cycle? Would market participants who
frequently settle certain securities transactions later than T+2 settle such transactions later
than T+1 if the Commission adopts the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)?
Conversely, under what circumstances are securities transactions settled on an expedited
basis (i.e., on timeframes less than T+2), and how often how common is such settlement?
What are the circumstances that motivate earlier settlements? If Rule 15c6-1(a) is
amended to shorten the standard settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1, how will the
proposed amendment affect these expedited settlement decisions?
5. To what extent do market participants currently rely on the override provision in Rule
15c6-1(a)? Would market participants expect use of the provision to increase or decrease
in a T+1 environment? Why or why not?
6. As noted above, the Commission previously issued an order that exempted security-based
swaps from the requirements under Rule 15c6-1, and subsequently extended that
exemptive relief on several occasions, but the exemptive relief that previously covered
55
compliance with Rule 15c6-1 expired in 2020.136 Should the Commission issue a new
order providing exemptive relief from compliance with Rule 15c6-1 for transactions in
security-based swaps? If so, why or why not?
7. Should the Commission amend any other provisions of Rule 15c6-1 (other than the
proposed amendments to the rule) for the purposes of shortening the standard settlement
cycle to T+1? If so, which provisions and why?
8. Are the conditions set forth in the Commission’s exemptive order for securities traded
outside the U.S. still appropriate?137 If not, why not? If the exemption should be
modified, how should it be modified and why?
9. Are the conditions set forth in the Commission’s exemptive order for insurance contracts
still appropriate?138 If not, why not? If the exemption should be modified, how should it
be modified and why?
10. Should the Commission provide exemptive relief under Rule 15c6-1(b) for any other
securities or types of transactions?
11. Would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 as proposed make it difficult for
broker-dealers to comply with the requirements of Rule 15c6-1? Please provide
examples.
12. How would retail investors be impacted by new processes that broker-dealers may
implement in support of a T+1 standard settlement cycle? For example, do commenters
believe that broker-dealers would require changes to the way that retail investors fund
 136 See supra note 83.
137 See supra note 90 and accompanying text.
138 See supra note 96 and accompanying text.
56
their accounts in a T+1 environment? If so, how? Would shortening the standard
settlement cycle to T+1 result in retail investors encountering ongoing costs due to a
delay in their ability to make investments? Would shortening the standard settlement
cycle to T+1 result in any benefits to retail investors?
13. How would institutional investors be impacted by new processes that broker-dealers may
implement in support of a T+1 standard settlement cycle? For example, do market
participants anticipate an increase in prefunding requirements for institutional investors in
a T+1 environment?
14. What impact, if any, would the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) have on market
participants who engage in cross-border transactions? To what extent would shortening
the standard settlement cycle in the U.S. to T+1 result in increased or decreased
operational costs to market participants? To what extent would shortening the standard
settlement cycle for securities transactions in the U.S. increase or decrease risks
associated with cross-border transactions or related transactions, such as financing
transactions?
15. What impact, if any, would the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) have on market
participants who engage in trading activity across various financial product classes, each
potentially involving a different settlement cycle? For example, what would be the
impact on market participants conducting transactions in U.S. equities and U.S.
commercial paper on the same day? Alternatively, are there benefits to alignment of the
settlement timeframes across most U.S. security types to one day? For example, options
and government securities currently settle on T+1 while equities, corporate bonds, and
municipal debt settle on T+2.
57
16. What impact, if any, would the proposal have on trading involving derivatives and
exchange-traded products (“ETPs”)?139 Would shortening the settlement cycle for ETPs
affect the costs of creating or redeeming shares in ETPs that hold portfolio securities that
are on a different settlement cycle, such as net capital charges related to collateral
requirements?140 If so, would such a change in costs affect the efficiency or effectiveness
of the arbitrage between an ETP’s secondary market price and the value of its underlying
assets? Would such a change lead to other downstream effects, such as an increase in the
use of cash or custom baskets?141 Similarly, would the proposed amendments affect
 139 ETPs constitute a diverse class of financial products that seek to provide investors with
exposure to financial instruments, financial benchmarks, or investment strategies across a wide
range of asset classes. ETP trading occurs on national securities exchanges and other secondary
markets that are regulated by the Commission under the Exchange Act, making ETPs widely
available to market participants, from individual investors to institutional investors, including
hedge funds and pension funds. The largest category of ETPs are ETFs, which are open-end
fund vehicles or UITs that are registered investment companies under the Investment Company
Act. See Request for Comment on Exchange-Traded Products, Exchange Act Release No.
75165 (June 12, 2015), 80 FR 34729 (June 17, 2015).
140 For example, the way a market participant executes a creation or redemption of an ETF
share resembles a stock trade in the secondary market. A market participant typically referred to
as an “Authorized Participant” or “AP” submits an order to create or redeem (“CR”) ETF shares
much like an investor submits an order to his broker to buy or sell a stock. Also, similar to a
stock trade, the CR order settles on a T+2 settlement cycle through NSCC. See ICI, 20 ICI
Research Perspective, no. 5, Sept. 2014, at 14, https://www.ici.org/pdf/per20-05.pdf; see also

141 Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act permits ETFs to use “custom baskets” if
their basket policies and procedures: (i) set forth detailed parameters for the construction and
acceptance of custom baskets that are in the best interest of the ETF and its shareholders,
including the process for any revisions to, or deviations from, those parameters; and (ii) specify
the titles or roles of the employees of the ETF’s investment adviser who are required to review
each custom basket for compliance with those parameters. See infra note 257 and accompanying
text (further discussing the creation unit purchase and redemption process for ETFs).
58
transactions in derivatives instruments if a derivative were to settle on a different
timeframe than its underlying reference assets?
17. What impact, if any, would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 have on the
levels of liquidity risk that may currently exist as a result of mismatches between the
settlement cycles for different markets? For example, would shortening the standard
settlement cycle to T+1 eliminate or reduce any liquidity risk that mutual funds may face
as a result of the mismatch between the current T+1 settlement cycle for transactions in
open-end mutual fund shares that are settled through NSCC and the T+2 settlement cycle
that is applicable to many portfolio securities held by mutual funds?
18. The Commission solicits comment on the status and readiness of the technology and
processes currently used by market participants to support a T+1 settlement cycle.
19. What impact would the Commission’s proposed deletion of paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1
have on underwriters, broker-dealers, and other market participants?
20. Have the technological and operational capabilities of broker-dealers and their service
providers improved sufficiently to allow prospectuses to be printed and delivered on time
if the standard settlement cycle for firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. is
shortened to T+1? Please describe such improvements and why they would or would not
be sufficient to support shortening the standard settlement cycle for such transactions.
21. Should the Commission shorten the standard settlement cycle for firm commitment
offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. to a time frame other than T+1 (e.g., T+2, or T+3)? If so,
why?
22. Would any additional technological and operational changes, if any, be necessary for
broker-dealers to print and deliver prospectuses on time for firm commitment offerings
59
priced after 4:30 p.m. if a T+1 standard settlement cycle is adopted for such transactions?
What costs would be associated with such improvements?
23. Would the Commission’s proposed deletion of paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1 decrease
exposures of underwriters, dealers and investors to market and credit risks related to the
bifurcated settlement periods for new issues and secondary market transactions? Please
explain why or why not.
24. With respect to corporate actions, in most cases the ex-date will be the record date
(“RD”), meaning that RD-1 will be the last day that a purchaser will gain the dividend or
entitlement.142 Given the shorter timeframes, the Commission requests comments on this
dynamic and statements in the T+1 Report urging a concerted effort among exchanges,
other authorities, and issuers to standardize some currently fragmented procedures to set
up and announce corporate actions.143
25. Regarding corporate actions that concern voluntary reorganizations, the Commission
solicits comments on the impact of a T+1 settlement cycle on DTC’s “cover/protect”
process for certain tenders, exchanges, or rights offerings.
144 This procedure enables
DTC participants to allow their investors to make or change their final elections until the
end of an offer’s expiration date; where an offer allows, participants provide DTC with a
notice of guaranteed delivery, allowing later delivery of the shares or rights. How would
 142 See, e.g., ISITC Virtual Winter Forum, DTCC presentation to Corporate Actions
Working Group (Dec. 13, 2021).

Actions Working Group (Dec. 13, 2021).
60
this process affect operations under a T+1 settlement cycle? Would any changes to this
process be needed?
26. The Commission generally requests comment on the deadlines and timeframes set forth
in the T+1 Report. For example, the Commission requests comment on their impact on
DTC’s IVORS function, used for retiring a UIT by withdrawing assets and transferring
them to a new UIT.145
27. If the Commission adopts the proposed deletion of paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1 and the
proposed conforming technical amendments to paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of the rule,
should the Commission adopt any additional amendments to Rule 15c6-1 in connection
with such changes?
B. New Requirement for “Same-Day Affirmation”
As discussed in Part II.B.1, integral to completing the institutional trade process is
achieving an affirmed confirmation, which can require a series of communications between a
broker-dealer and its institutional customer. Since 2000, market participants have identified
accelerating this process, which requires agreement among the parties regarding the trade details
that facilitate trade allocation when needed, as well as trade confirmation and affirmation, as one
of the core building blocks to improve the speed, safety, and efficiency of the trade settlement
process, and ultimately to achieve shorter settlement cycles.146 In particular, in the SIA Business
 145 See DTC, IVORS Service Guide,
https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/Settlement-Asset-Services/EDL/IVORS.pdf.
146 See SIA Business Case Report, supra note 21; BCG Study, supra note 22; see also T+2
Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69252, 69254 (describing in detail the SIA Business Case
Report and the BCG Study). The building blocks are described generally as the core initiatives
61
Case Report, the securities industry noted the need to prioritize ensuring that a higher number
and proportion of trades were confirmed and affirmed on trade date.147 These improvements
were considered essential to compressing the settlement cycle and facilitating an environment
less prone to operational risk.148 This objective, where broker-dealers and their institutional
customers allocate, confirm, and affirm the trade details necessary to achieve settlement by the
end of trade date has sometimes been referred to as “same-day affirmation.”
In its 2004 concept release seeking comment on methods to improve the safety and
operational efficiency of the National C&S System to achieve straight-through processing,
149 the
Commission explored whether to adopt its own rule or whether the SROs should amend their
existing rules to require the completion of the confirmation and affirmation process on trade
date.150 Many market participants supported a Commission rule to mandate it, but believed that
such requirements should be implemented in phases to allow for the development of certain

that need to be implemented prior to shortening the settlement cycle. See SIA Business Case
Report, supra note 21, at 18.
147 See, e.g., Press Release, SIA, SIA Board Endorses Program to Modernize Clearing,
Settlement Process for Securities (July 18, 2002) (statement from the SIA Board of Directors
endorsing straight-through processing); letter from Jeffrey C. Bernstein, Chairman, SIA STP
Steering Committee, Securities Industry Association (June 16, 2004) (“SIA Letter”). The

processing improvements.151 Recommendations for such improvements included: (i) achieving
100% of trades as matched or affirmed as soon as possible after execution on trade date; (ii)
achieving asynchronous (non-sequential) and electronic communication between all trade
parties, including notices of execution, allocations, match status, confirmation status, and
settlement instructions; (iii) adoption of an industry standard electronic format for message
communication; and (iv) adoption of standards that allow manual processing on an exceptiononly basis.152
Since 2004, the industry has made significant progress in developing new centralized
systems and processes designed to automate and streamline the institutional trade processing
environment, both from an operational and technological perspective.153 Market participants
also rely on a variety of “local” matching tools that allow them to compare trade information
received from another party against their own trade information. Further, industry coordination
has facilitated improved communication between the parties to a trade using standardized
messaging protocols, such as FIX, and the SWIFT network. When the Commission proposed to

platform that continues to automate the trade confirmation process and includes connectivity via
FIX and the SWIFT network to custodian banks for the purposes of settlement notification. See

shorten the settlement cycle to T+2, the Commission observed that the market has improved
these confirmation, affirmation, and matching processes through the use of CMSPs.
154
A 2010 white paper issued by Omgeo (now DTCC ITP) also described same-day
affirmation as “a prerequisite” of shortening the settlement cycle because of its impact on the
rate of settlement fails and on operational risk.155 According to data published in 2011 regarding
affirmation rates achieved through the use of one CMSP, on average, 45% of trades were
affirmed on trade date, 90% were affirmed by the end of T+1, and 92% were affirmed by noon
on T+2.156 Existing processes for matching institutional trades rely on a number of manual
elements, and currently only about 68% of trades achieve affirmation by 12:00 midnight at the
end of trade date.157 While these rates have improved over time, the improvements have been
incremental and, in the Commission’s view, insufficient. Failing to affirm by the end of trade
date increases the likelihood that errors or exceptions will not be resolved in time for settlement.
The sooner the parties have affirmed the trade information for their transaction, the lower the
likelihood of a settlement fail because the parties will have more time to identify and resolve any
potential errors. The T+1 Report highlights the need for achieving affirmation on trade date and
encourages that on trade date allocations be completed by 7:00 p.m. ET and affirmations by 9:00

64
p.m. ET to facilitate shortening of the standard settlement cycle to T+1.158 As discussed below,
the Commission proposes Rule 15c6-2 to require completion of institutional trade allocations,
confirmations, and affirmations by the end of trade date.
1. Proposed Rule 15c6-2 under the Exchange Act
The Commission proposes Rule 15c6-2 to require that, where parties have agreed to
engage in an allocation, confirmation, or affirmation process, a broker or dealer would be
prohibited from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other
than an exempted security, a government security, a municipal security, commercial paper,
bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) on behalf of a customer unless such broker or dealer
has entered into a written agreement with the customer that requires the allocation, confirmation,
affirmation, or any combination thereof, be completed as soon as technologically practicable and
no later than the end of the day on trade date in such form as may be necessary to achieve
settlement in compliance with Rule 15c6-1(a). As explained in further detail below, the
Commission believes that implementing a T+1 standard settlement cycle, as well as any potential
further shortening beyond T+1, would require a significant improvement in the current rates of
same-day affirmations to ensure timely settlement in a T+1 environment. In this way, the
Commission also believes that proposed Rule 15c6-2 should facilitate timely settlement as a
general matter, regardless of shortening the settlement cycle, because it will accelerate the
completion of affirmations on trade date. Because broker-dealers and their institutional
customers will review and reconcile trade data earlier in the settlement process, the Commission
believes that same-day affirmation can improve the accuracy and efficiency of institutional trade
processing. In particular, conducting these activities earlier in the process, and as soon as
 158 See T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 13.
65
technologically practicable, will allow more time to resolve errors, an important consideration as
shorter settlement cycles compress the available time to resolve errors.
Proposed Rule 15c6-2 applies requirements to a broker-dealer’s contractual arrangements
with its institutional customers because the Commission preliminarily believes that brokerdealers are best positioned to ensure (through their contractual arrangements) that their
customers, including those acting on behalf of their customers, will perform the required
allocation, confirmation, and affirmation functions on the appropriate timeframe and as soon as
technologically practicable. Because broker-dealers are the party to a transaction most likely to
have access to a clearing agency, the broker-dealer is also the party best positioned to ensure the
timely settlement of institutional trades, and as such, should be able to ensure via its customer
agreements that institutional customers or their agents also comport their operations to facilitate
same-day affirmation.
159 In addition, requiring broker-dealers to enter into written agreements
that require the allocation, confirmation, and affirmation processes be completed as soon as
technologically practicable and no later than the end of trade date may help increase the use of
standardized terms and trade details across market participants, which may enable the parties to
reduce their reliance on manual processes in favor of more automated methods.
As proposed, Rule 15c6-2 does not define the terms “allocation,” “confirmation,” or
“affirmation.” As discussed in Part II.B.3.c), trade allocation refers to the process by which an
institutional investor (often an investment adviser) allocates a large trade among various client
 159 In an effort to also encourage investment advisers to ensure that their own operations and
procedures for institutional trade processing can accommodate T+1 or shorter settlement
timeframes, in Part III.C the Commission proposes an amendment to an existing recordkeeping
rule for registered investment advisers.
66
accounts or determines how to apportion securities trades ordered contemporaneously on behalf
of multiple funds or non-fund clients.160 The terms “confirmation” and “affirmation” refer to the
transmission of messages among broker-dealers, institutional investors, and custodian banks to
confirm the terms of a trade executed for an institutional investor, a process necessary to ensure
the accuracy of the trade being settled. Broker-dealers transmit trade confirmations to their
customers to verify trade information, and customers provide an affirmation in response to affirm
the confirmation so that the transaction can be prepared for settlement. The Commission
believes that these terms are widely used and generally understood by market participants who
engage in institutional trade processing.
Proposed Rule 15c6-2 uses the term “confirmation” to refer to the operational message
that includes trade details provided by the broker-dealer to the customer to verify trade
information so that a trade can be prepared for settlement on the timeline established in Rule
15c6-1(a).161 In contrast, confirmations required by Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 concern a series
of disclosures that broker-dealers are required to provide in writing to customers at or before
 160 For example, DTCC ITP’s OASYS platform is a trade allocation and acceptance service
that communicates trade and allocation details between investment managers and broker-dealers.
DTCC ITP is in the process of decommissioning OASYS and replacing it with CTM, an
enriched automated system that offers central matching workflow (including allocation)
settlement notification and ALERT services. ALERT provides a database for the maintenance
and communication of account and SSI information so that investment managers, broker-dealers,
custodian banks and prime brokers can share account information electronically. See DTCC,
ALERT, https://www.dtcc.com/institutional-trade-processing/itp/alert.
161 Confirmations will include the following trade information: transaction type, security
(including an identifier and description), account ID and title, trade date, settlement date,
quantity, price, commission (if any), taxes and fees (if any), accrued interest (if appropriate) and
the net amount of money to be paid or received at settlement. A confirmation will also include
the broker name and whether the broker-dealer was acting as principal or agent on the trade.

completion of a transaction.
162 While some matching or electronic trade confirmation services
may use the operational confirmation process described in proposed Rule 15c6-2 to produce a
confirmation for purposes of compliance with Rule 10b-10, others may not. Accordingly, the
term “confirmation” as used in proposed Rule 15c6-2 should be understood to refer to the
institutional trade processing message or verification and not the disclosure required under Rule
10b-10. Below the Commission solicits comment as to whether these terms are sufficiently
understood to facilitate compliance with the proposed rule.
Proposed Rule 15c6-2 would also require broker-dealers to enter into a written agreement
with a “customer” that has agreed to engage in the allocation, confirmation, or affirmation
process. For purposes of the rule, the term “customer” includes any person or agent of such
person who opens a brokerage account at a broker-dealer to effect an institutional trade or
purchases or sells a security for which the broker-dealer receives or will receive compensation.
In the institutional trade processing environment, the Commission understands that at times, a
broker-dealer may accept instructions or trades from entities acting on behalf of the institutional
investor. The term, as used in proposed Rule 15c6-2, is intended to cover both the institutional
investor and any and all agents acting on its behalf. As stated below, the Commission is seeking
further comment on whether the obligations imposed by proposed Rule 15c6-2 should explicitly
state that contracts of such agents acting on behalf of the broker-dealer’s customer are subject to
the proposed rule or whether the proposed rule text as written is sufficiently clear.
Finally, the written agreement executed pursuant to proposed Rule 15c6-1 requires that
the allocation, confirmation, and affirmation processes, or any combination thereof, related to
 162 17 CFR 240.10b-10. For more information on confirmations required under Rule 10b10, see Part III.E.3.
68
these trades be completed as soon as technologically practicable and no later than the end of the
day on trade date in such form as may be necessary to achieve settlement in compliance with
Rule 15c6-1(a).163 The Commission is proposing “end of the day on trade date” rather than
requiring a specific time earlier than end of day to allow firms to maximize their internal
processes to meet the appropriate cutoff times and other deadlines, as soon as technologically
practicable. The Commission expects that different sectors of the market, different types of asset
classes or market participants, and different operational processes (e.g., cross-border
transactions) may have varying processing deadlines, some of which may need to be earlier than
end of the day to facilitate trade processing. For example, as noted above, the T+1 Report
contemplates moving the “ITP Affirmation Cutoff” from 11:30 a.m. on the day after trade date to
9:00 p.m. on trade date to facilitate a T+1 settlement cycle.164 Accordingly, the parties would be
able under the rule to require earlier timeframes when appropriate. Moreover, the SROs could
consider whether and how to use earlier than end of day deadlines, such as those recommended
by the T+1 Report.
2. Basis for Requiring Affirmation No Later than the End of Trade Date
As discussed in Part II.B, aspects of post-trade processing for institutional transactions
remain inefficient and costly for several reasons. Although same-day affirmation is considered a
best practice for institutional trade processing, adoption is not universal across market
 163 For purposes of this rule, “end of the day” has the same meaning as it is generally
understood: no later than 11:59:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving
Time, whichever is currently in effect on trade date.
164 See T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 39.
69
participants or even across all trades entered by a given participant.165 Market participants
continue to use hundreds of “local” matching platforms,166 and rely on inconsistent SSI data
independently maintained by broker-dealers, investment managers, custodians, sub-custodians,
and agents on separate databases.167 As discussed in Part II.B, processing institutional trades
requires managing the back and forth involved with transmitting and reconciling trade
information among the parties, functionally matching and re-matching with the counterparties to
the trade, as well as custodians and agents, to facilitate settlement. It also requires market
participants to engage in allocation processes, such as allocation-level cancellations and
corrections, some of which are still processed manually.
168 This collection of redundant, often
manual steps and the use of uncoordinated (i.e., not standardized) databases can lead to delays,
 165 While the concept of completing these functions on trade date has often been referred to a
“same-day” affirmation, the Commission is proposing instead to use the term “trade date” in the
rule to be clear that the allocation, confirmation, and affirmation process should be completed on
the trade date.
166 Local matching platforms include, for example, the trade reconciliation and inventory
management tools that market participants use to reconcile trade information. See DTCC,
Embracing Post-Trade Automation: Seven Ways the Sell-Side Will Benefit from No-Touch
Future (Nov. 2020) (“DTCC Embracing Post-Trade Automation”), https://www.dtcc.com/itphub/dist/downloads/broker_supplement_11.11.20z.pdf. Examples of such service providers
include Bloomberg, Corfinancial, Lightspeed, and SS&C Technologies.
167 For more information about the use and impact of “local” matching platforms, see supra
note 166. A 2020 DTCC survey of global broker-dealers found that certain institutional posttrade processing costs could be reduced by 20-25% through leveraging post-trade automation,
which would in turn eliminate redundancies and manual processing and mitigate operational
risks. See DTCC, DTCC Identifies Seven Areas of Broker Cost Savings as a Result of Greater
Post-Trade Automation (Nov. 18, 2020), https://www.dtcc.com/news/2020/november/18/dtccidentifies-seven-areas-of-broker-cost-savings-as-a-result-of-greater-post-trade-automation; see

exceptions processing, settlement fails, wasted resources, and economic losses. While the
proposed rule does not require any changes to manual processes or existing uses of databases and
exceptions processing, the Commission preliminarily believes that market participants may
pursue improvements to these existing processes to manage their obligations under Rule 15c6-2,
if adopted.
Although proposed Rule 15c6-2 does not require settlement of the transaction on trade
date, the Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule helps ensure that institutional
trades will timely settle on T+1 because, by promoting the completion of these processes as soon
as technologically practicable and no later than the end of trade date, it reduces the likelihood of
exceptions or other errors with respect to trade information that can prevent a transaction from
settling. In the Commission’s view, because the rule requires that allocation, confirmation, and
affirmation be completed as soon as technologically practicable and no later than the end of trade
date, it can also facilitate shortening the settlement cycle, both with respect to T+1 and
potentially for shortening beyond T+1 in the future. By elevating an industry best practice to a
Commission requirement, the Commission believes that proposed Rule 15c6-2 can significantly
improve the current 68% rate of affirmations on trade date by standardizing the obligations of
broker-dealers and their institutional customers with respect to the timing of achieving
affirmations. This, in turn, could facilitate increases in operational efficiency necessary to
support an orderly transition to shorter settlement cycles. The Commission also anticipates that
SROs will consider whether to propose rule changes to incorporate the requirements in new Rule
71
15c6-2 if adopted,169 and proposed Rule 15c6-2 would likely encourage further development of
automated and standardized practices among market participants to facilitate settlement of
institutional trades.
3. Request for Comment
The Commission solicits comment on the particular questions set forth below, and
encourages commenters to submit any relevant data or analysis in connection with their answers.
28. Would proposed Rule 15c6-2 accomplish the stated objectives? Would the proposed rule
encourage further standardization and automation in the processing of institutional
trades? What effect will the proposed rule have on improving efficiencies and reducing
errors and fails? Please provide a basis or explanation for your position.
29. Proposed Rule 15c6-2 uses such terms as “allocation,” “confirmation,” and “affirmation.”
As discussed above, the Commission believes that these are well understood concepts.
Should these terms be defined for purposes of the proposed rule? If so, please explain
which terms need further definition and why? Please include the recommended elements
of such definitions.
30. Similarly, does the term “end of the day on trade date” need to be defined? If so, please
provide information as to why and include recommended elements of such a definition.
31. Proposed Rule 15c6-2 uses the term “customer.” Given that often agents of the customer
are providing allocation, confirmation or affirmation instructions or communications to
 169 For example, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Rule 11860 does not
require that a broker-dealer send a confirmation of trade details until the day after trade date,
which can delay the affirmation process until T+1 (in a T+2 environment) and reduce the time
available to manage trade exceptions. FINRA, as well as DTC and DTCC ITP Matching may
propose new rules, procedures or services to further enhance the ability of market participants to
settle in shorter timeframes.
72
the broker-dealer on behalf of the broker-dealer’s customer, does the rule as written
address this scenario? Does the use of the term “customer” sufficiently incorporate any
and all agents of the customer? Is the Commission’s understanding of these terms
consistent with the industry’s use of these terms? Why or why not? Should the term
“customer” be defined for purposes of Rule 15c6-2? If so, please include the
recommended elements of such a definition.
32. What effect would proposed Rule 15c6-2 have on the relationship between a brokerdealer and its customer?
33. Do the perceived benefits of proposed Rule 15c6-2 or the benefits of trade date
confirmation and affirmation accrue to all participants – brokers-dealers (including prime
brokers), institutional customers, custodians, or matching utilities? If not, why? Do they
accrue differently based on size of the entity? Please explain.
34. Does proposed Rule 15c6-2 introduce any new risks? If so, please describe such risks
and whether they can be quantified. Can these risks be mitigated? If so, how?
35. If proposed Rule 15c6-2 is adopted by the Commission, what should be the necessary
time frame for implementing such a rule? What factors should the Commission consider
in determining the implementation date?
36. Would proposed Rule 15c6-2 affect cross-border trading or cross-border trade
processing? If so, how would it do so?
37. As proposed, Rule 15c6-2 excludes exempted securities, government securities,
municipal securities, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, and commercial bills. For
those asset classes that do not already settle on T+1, should the proposed rule apply to
73
any or all of these excluded securities? Please discuss the reasons why any or all of these
securities should or should not be excluded from Rule 15c6-2.
38. What if anything should the Commission do to further facilitate the use of standardized
industry protocols and standardization of reference data by broker-dealers and
institutional customers, including investment advisers and custodians? What if anything
should the Commission do to further facilitate efficiency in processing institutional trades
and reducing errors and fails?
39. Would the adoption of further Commission rules be necessary to require or further
facilitate the objective of ensuring that institutional trades are operationally capable of
settling on a T+1 or shorter timeframe?
40. The T+1 Report indicates that market participants may cancel and rebill an affirmed trade
because of a monetary change to the trade and states that these instances occur frequently
in a T+2 settlement cycle.170 Why are trades affirmed when monetary amounts may not
agree? Should it be permissible to cancel an affirmed trade? Why or why not?
41. Are investment advisers matching their records about a trade against the received
confirmation prior to affirming? If not, why not? If so, what criteria are used to
determine that a ‘match’ has occurred? Which fields must match? Should financial
values, such as unit price, total commission, accrued interest for fixed-income trades and
net amount to be paid or received be matched? What steps does or should the adviser
take to ensure the affirming party, if not the adviser, is matching adviser-provided trade
information against the broker or dealer confirmation before affirming trades?
 170 See T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 26.
74
42. When matching trade information on a given transaction between the investment adviser
and the broker-dealer, the parties to the transaction may view differences, such as
differences in amounts, as minor and therefore within a satisfactory “tolerance” range to
match, whereas in other cases a party may be unwilling to match if any discrepancy in
trade information exists. These differences in trade information may be perceived to be
small in absolute terms or relative to the size of the trade. Parties also may set
“tolerance” thresholds in their systems to ignore some differences, such as trade
information where an element differs by “one penny” or less than 0.01% of the value
being compared. To what extent do advisers apply such tolerances when matching
trades? What fields are subject to such tolerance thresholds and what size tolerances are
generally used? For example, if the net money for settlement as calculated by the adviser
differs from the net money for settlement as calculated by the broker or dealer as part of
the confirmation by a dollar, is that trade a “match”? And if so, which value is used for
settlement, the amount on the confirmation or the adviser’s records? Does the other party
then adjust its records to the amount used for settlement? Are investors ever harmed by
this approach? Is there general consensus on tolerances? Are there industry groups that
define guidelines or best practices on the use of tolerances and, if so, do they all agree?
43. Should advisers be expected to affirm trades or should this always be a function of the
broker-dealer or bank custodian holding the account where securities will be delivered?
How should the adviser proceed if the deadline to notify a broker-dealer or bank
custodian is approaching yet a confirmation has not been received? If advisers delay
notification of the custodian until after affirming the trade in such a scenario, will this
75
create delays in recalling loaned securities or securities that may have been pledged as
collateral?
44. In some cases, bank custodians may receive a copy of a confirmation (a “duplicate
confirmation”) as an early alert of potential trade activity. Are these duplicate
confirmations relied upon to affirm the trade information? Do custodians ever settle
trades based solely on information received in a duplicate confirmation? Should this
practice be permitted? Please explain why or why not. Do custodians use these duplicate
confirmations as an early alert to call a security back from being on loan or to identify a
security that may be pledged as collateral?
45. Elements of FINRA Rule 11860 could be used to help facilitate compliance with
proposed Rule 15c6-2, if adopted. Is proposed Rule 15c6-2 consistent with the approach
to RVP/DVP settlement set forth in FINRA Rule 11860 and, more generally, the Uniform
Practice Code (“UPC”) set forth in the FINRA Rule 11000 series?171 If not, please
explain.
 171 The UPC is a series of FINRA rules, interpretations and explanations designed to make
uniform, where practicable, custom, practice, usage, and trading technique in the investment
banking and securities business, particularly with regard to operational and settlement issues.
These can include such matters as trade terms, deliveries, payments, dividends, rights, interest,
reclamations, exchange of confirmations, stamp taxes, claims, assignments, powers of
substitution, computation of interest and basis prices, due-bills, transfer fees, “when, as and if
issued” trading, “when, as and if distributed” trading, marking to the market, and close-out
procedures. The UPC was created so that the transaction of day-to-day business by members
may be simplified and facilitated; that business disputes and misunderstandings, which arise
from uncertainty and lack of uniformity in such matters, may be eliminated; and that the
mechanisms of a free and open market may be improved and impediments thereto removed.
See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 91789 (May 7, 2021), 86 FR 26084, 26088 (May 12, 2021).
76
46. Should proposed Rule 15c6-2 have separate requirements and deadlines for each step in
the allocation, affirmation, and confirmation processes? And if so, should deadlines be
relative to a prior dependent activity? For example, should allocations be communicated
within an hour of, or no later than three hours after, receipt of the notice of execution and
affirmations be communicated within an hour of, or no later than three hours after, receipt
of the confirmation? Or is it acceptable to require end of day for all activity? What
changes would be recommended for a T+0 environment?
C. Proposed Amendment to Recordkeeping Rule for Investment Advisers
Under proposed Rule 15c6-2, a broker-dealer would be prohibited from entering into a
contract on behalf of a customer for the purchase or sale of certain securities172 unless it has
entered into a written agreement with the customer that requires the allocation, confirmation,
affirmation, or any combination thereof to be completed no later than the end of the day on trade
date in such form as may be necessary to achieve settlement in compliance with proposed Rule
15c6-1(a).
173 Investment advisers, as customers of a broker or dealer, may become a party to
such an agreement. Proposed Rule 15c6-2 does not specify which party would be obligated to
provide the necessary allocation, confirmation, and affirmation, although the Commission
understands that, generally, the customer (here, the investment adviser) customarily provides the
broker or dealer with instructions directing how to allocate the securities to be purchased or sold,
and the broker or dealer confirms the trade details, which the adviser, in turn, affirms.
 172 As discussed in Part III.B.1, proposed Rule 15c6-2 would not apply to an exempted
security, government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or
commercial bills.
173 See supra Part III.B (discussing the proposed new requirement for “same-day
affirmation”).
77
Based on staff experience, the Commission believes that advisers generally have
recordkeeping processes that include keeping originals and/or electronic copies of such
allocations, confirmations, and affirmations. However, in some instances this may not be the
case. Some activities, such as affirmation, may be performed on the adviser’s behalf by a third
party, such as middle-office outsourcing provider, a custodian or a prime broker, and advisers
may not maintain these records.
174 In addition, based on staff experience, the Commission also
believes that some advisers do not maintain these records or maintain them only in paper.
Accordingly, the Commission is proposing an amendment to the investment adviser
recordkeeping rule designed to ensure that registered investment advisers that are parties to
contracts under proposed Rule 15c6-2 retain records of confirmations received, and keep records
of the allocations and affirmations sent to a broker or dealer.
175 Specifically, the Commission
proposes to amend Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”)
by adding a requirement in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) that advisers maintain records of each
confirmation received, and any allocation and each affirmation sent, with a date and time stamp
for each allocation (if applicable) and affirmation that indicates when the allocation or
affirmation was sent to the broker or dealer if the adviser is a party to a contract under proposed
Rule 15c6-2. As with other records required under Rule 204-2(a)(7), advisers would be required
 174 See DTCC ITP Forum Remarks, supra note 58 (stating that up to 70% of institutional
trades are affirmed by custodians).
175 See proposed Rule 204-2(a)(7)(iii), infra Part 0.
78
to keep originals of confirmations, and copies of allocations and affirmations, described in the
proposed rule, but may maintain records electronically if they satisfy certain conditions.
176
While the Commission believes that retaining records of all of these documents is
important, we understand that the timing of communicating allocations to the broker or dealer is
a critical pre-requisite to ensure that confirmations can be issued in a timely manner, and
affirmation is the final step necessary for an adviser to acknowledge agreement on the terms of
the trade or alert the broker or dealer of a discrepancy. The proposed amendment to Rule 204-2
therefore would require advisers to time and date stamp records of any allocation and each
affirmation. The proposed time and date stamp for these communications would occur when
they were “sent to the broker or dealer.” To meet this proposed requirement, an adviser
generally should time and date stamp records of each allocation (if applicable) and affirmation to
the nearest minute.
Based on staff experience, the Commission believes many advisers send allocations and
affirmations electronically to brokers or dealers, and many records are already consistently date
and time stamped to the nearest minute using either a local time zone or a centralized time zone,
such as coordinated universal time, or “UTC.”177 The Commission believes that date and time
 176 See Rule 204-2(a)(7) (requiring making and keeping originals of all written
communications received and copies of all written communications sent by an investment
adviser relating to the records listed thereunder). But see Rule 204-2(g) (permitting advisers to
maintain records electronically if they establish and maintain required procedures).
177 See U.S. Naval Observatory, Systems of Time,
https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Organization/United-States-Naval-Observatory/Precise-TimeDepartment/The-USNO-Master-Clock/Definitions-of-Systems-of-Time/. The Commission
understands that some firms have systems that date and time stamp records with greater
precision. Certainly as volumes increase and the timeframes to complete operational activities,
such as settlement, shorten, the Commission believes from a practical perspective that many
firms will find value in having increased precision in the time stamps on trade-related activities.
79
stamping these records to the nearest minute would evidence that the advisers have met their
obligations to timely achieve a matched trade.
The Commission recognizes that requiring these records and adding time and date stamps
to records would, however, add additional costs and burdens for those advisers that do not
currently maintain these records or do not use electronic systems to send allocations and
affirmations to brokers or dealers or maintain confirmations. For example, some advisers may
incur costs to update their processes to accommodate these records. For advisers that use third
parties to perform or communicate allocations or affirmations, they also could incur costs
associated with directing the third parties to electronically copy the adviser on any allocations or
affirmations.
178
We believe that requiring these records and requiring a time and date stamp of all
affirmations and any applicable allocations (but not confirmations) would help advisers establish
that they have timely met contractual obligations under proposed Rule 15c6-2 and ultimately
help ensure that trades involving such advisers would timely settle on T+1. In addition, we
believe the proposed requirement would aid the Commission staff in preparing for examinations
of investment advisers and assessing adviser compliance.
1. Request for Comment
We request comment on the proposed amendment to the investment adviser
recordkeeping rule:
 178 For additional discussion on this and other initial costs and burdens of the proposed
amendment to Rule 204-2, see infra Part V.C.5.b).
80
47. Should the Commission amend Rule 204-2 to specifically correspond to the proposed
Rule 15c6-2 and require advisers that are parties to contracts under proposed Rule 15c6-2
to retain records of the documents described in that rule?
48. Should the Commission require that these records be retained under a different provision
of the recordkeeping rule? For example, should the Commission instead amend Rule
204-2(a)(3) (requiring advisers to retain “memorandums” of orders) to explicitly include
these records? If so, the determination of whether to maintain the relevant allocations,
confirmation, and affirmations would depend on if they were part of an “order.” Given
that certain orders may never be executed, and that certain executed trades potentially
might not have orders associated with them, would including the requirement in the
recordkeeping requirement related to “orders” result in advisers not retaining some
allocations, confirmations, and affirmations? Separately, would maintaining the
proposed records under Rule 204-2(a)(3) create confusion about whether advisers need to
maintain originals and/or duplicate copies of relevant allocations, confirmations, and
affirmations, when the specified record is the memorandum? Or, do advisers currently
maintain records of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations under this provision to
document the orders they describe in the memoranda?
49. Should the Commission require time and date stamping of the allocations and
affirmations to the nearest minute, as proposed? Would advisers need to make system
changes to accomplish such time and date stamping of allocations and affirmations? Is
there an approach other than time and date stamping that would allow Commission staff
to verify that an adviser has completed the steps necessary to facilitate settlement in a
timely manner? Should the Commission require time and date stamping of just the
81
affirmation or just the allocation? Is the requirement to time and date stamp the
allocation or affirmation when it is “sent to the broker or dealer” clear? Should we
require the time and date stamp at a different point in time? If so, when?
50. Should we require time and date stamping of receipt of the confirmation as well? What
additional costs or burdens would such time stamping incur?
51. Under what circumstances do third parties, such as prime brokers or custodians, affirm
trades instead of advisers, and in those instances do the third parties send copies of the
affirmations to the advisers? Does this happen for all accounts an adviser manages or
only some accounts and why?
52. If advisers are matching adviser records to confirmations, some trades will not match. In
other instances, an adviser may receive a confirmation for a trade that the adviser does
not “know,” such as when an adviser did not execute a trade or when the adviser’s
trading desk has not notified the adviser’s middle or back office. In such cases, do
advisers proactively notify the broker -dealer that the trade does not match (often referred
to as “don’t know” or sending a “DK”)? Should the proposed rule be more specific about
recordkeeping when an adviser does not agree with or does not “know” a trade for which
a confirmation was received? How often do trades not match? How frequently do
advisers receive confirmations they do not “know?”
82
D. New Requirement for CMSPs to Facilitate Straight-Through Processing
Because of the rising volume of transactions for which CMSPs provide matching and
other services,179 CMSPs have become increasingly critical to the functioning of the securities
market.180 As described in Part II.B.1, CMSPs facilitate communications among a broker-dealer,
an institutional investor or its investment adviser, and the institutional investor’s custodian to
reach agreement on the details of a securities transaction, enabling the trade allocation,
confirmation, affirmation, and/or the matching of institutional trades. Once the trade details have
been agreed among the parties or matched by the CMSP, the CMSP can then facilitate settlement
of the transaction.
While the introduction of new technologies and streamlined operations such as those
offered by CMSPs have improved the efficiency of post-trade processing over time, the
Commission believes more should be done to facilitate further improvements, particularly with
respect to the processing of institutional trades. Currently, some SRO rules require the use of
 179 See, e.g., Press Release, DTCC, Over 1,800 Firms Agree to Leverage U.S. Institutional
Trade Matching Capabilities in DTCC’s CTM (Oct. 12, 2021),
https://www.dtcc.com/news/2021/october/12/over-1800-firms-agree-to-leverage-dtccs-ctm;
DTCC’s Trade Processing Suite Traffics One Billion Trades, Traders Magazine (Feb. 13, 2017),
https://www.tradersmagazine.com/departments/clearing/dtccs-trade-processing-suite-trafficsone-billion-trades/.
180 CMSPs are clearing agencies as defined in Section 3(a)(23) of the Exchange Act, and as
such, are required to register as a clearing agency or obtain an exemption from registration. The
Commission has currently exempted three CMSPs from the registration requirement. The
Commission also has adopted rules that apply to both registered and exempt clearing agencies,
including CMSPs operating pursuant to an exemption from registration. See, e.g., Regulation
Systems Compliance and Integrity, Exchange Act Release No. 73639 (Nov. 19, 2014), 79 FR
72252 (Dec. 5, 2014) (“Regulation SCI Adopting Release”).
83
CMSP services for institutional trade processing.181 The Commission has previously explained
that a shortened settlement cycle may lead to expanded use of CMSPs, as well as increased focus
on enhancing the services and operations of the CMSPs themselves.
182 In particular, the
Commission believes that eliminating the use of tools that encourage or require manual
processing, alongside the continued development and implementation of more efficient
automated systems in the institutional trade processing environment, is essential to reducing risk
and costs to ensure the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
183
Below is a discussion of the elements of the proposed rule.
1. Policies and Procedures to Facilitate Straight-Through Processing
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would require a CMSP to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce policies and procedures to facilitate straight-through processing for transactions
involving broker-dealers and their customers.
The term “straight-through processing” generally refers to processes that allow for the
automation of the entire trade process from trade execution through settlement without manual
intervention.184 In the context of institutional trade processing under this rule, straight-through
processing occurs when a market participant or its agent uses the facilities of a CMSP to enter
trade details and completes the trade allocation, confirmation, affirmation, and/or matching
 181 See e.g., FINRA Rule 11860 (requiring a broker-dealer to use a registered clearing
agency, a CMSP, or a qualified vendor to complete delivery-versus-payment transactions with
their customers).
182 T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69258.
183 See T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 9.
184 See SIA Business Case Report, supra note 21, at app. E (defining “straight-through
processing”).
84
processes without manual intervention. Under the rule, a CMSP facilitates straight-through
processing when its policies and procedures enable its users to minimize or eliminate, to the
greatest extent that is technologically practicable, the need for manual input of trade details or
manual intervention to resolve errors and exceptions that can prevent settlement of the trade. A
CMSP also facilitates straight-through processing when it enables, to the greatest extent that is
technologically practicable, the transmission of messages regarding errors, exceptions, and
settlement status information among the parties to a trade and their settlement agents. Under the
rule, policies and procedures generally should establish a holistic framework for facilitating
straight-through processing, as just described, on a CMSP-wide basis. CMSPs should also
generally consider and address how the services, systems, and any operational requirements a
CMSP applies to its users ensure that the CMSP’s policies and procedures advance the goal of
achieving straight-through processing for trades processed through it. For example, a CMSP’s
policies and procedures generally should explain the criteria that the CMSP applies to determine
when a “match” has been achieved, including any relevant tolerances that it or its users might
apply to achieve a match, and the extent to which such criteria should be standardized or
customized. With respect to the use of electronic trade confirmation services, which often rely
on legacy technologies, a CMSP’s policies and procedures generally should establish a timeline
for transitioning users away from manual processes to matching services that reduce a party’s
reliance on the manual, often sequential, entry and reconciliation of trade information.
The Commission believes that increasing the efficiency of using a CMSP can reduce the
risk that a trade will fail to settle, as well as the costs associated with correcting errors that result
from the use of manual processes and data entry, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the
National C&S System. CMSPs have become increasingly connected to a wide variety of market
85
participants in the U.S.,
185 increasing the need to reduce risks and inefficiencies that may result
from use of a CMSP’s services. Because the proposed rule would preclude reliance on service
offerings at CMSPs that rely on manual processing, the Commission preliminarily believes the
proposed rule will better position CMSPs to provide services that not only reduce risk generally
but also help facilitate an orderly transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle,186 as well as
potential further shortening of the settlement cycle in the future.
The Commission has taken a “policies and procedures” approach in developing the
proposed rule because it preliminarily believes such an approach will remain effective over time
as CMSPs consider and offer new technologies and operations to improve the settlement of
institutional trades. The Commission also believes that improving the CMSP’s systems to
facilitate straight-through processing can help market participants consider additional ways to
make their own systems more efficient. In addition, a “policies and procedures” approach can
help ensure that a CMSP considers in a holistic fashion how the obligations it applies to its users
will advance the implementation of methodologies, operational capabilities, systems, or services
that support straight-through processing.
In considering how to develop policies and procedures that facilitate straight-through
processing, a CMSP generally should consider the full range of operations and services related to
the processing of institutional trades for settlement. For example, as noted above, the CMSP
 185 See, e.g., DTCC, About DTCC Institutional Trade Processing,
https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/dtccitp (noting that DTCC ITP, parent
to DTCC ITP Matching, serves 6,000 financial services firms in 52 countries).
186 As discussed in Part III.B.2, the T+1 Report contemplates moving the “ITP Affirmation
Cutoff” from 11:30 a.m. on the day after trade date to 9:00 p.m. on trade date. See supra note
164. Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 is consistent with, and should help promote, efforts to shorten the
processing time for institutional trades in a T+1 environment.
86
often acts as a communication platform for different market participants to transmit messages
regarding errors, exceptions, and settlement status information among the parties to a trade and
their settlement agents. Under proposed Rule 17Ad-27, a CMSP also generally should consider
the extent to which its policies, procedures, and processes restrict, inhibit, or delay the ability of
users to transmit such messages to any agent that assists said users in preparing or submitting the
trade for settlement. In the Commission’s view, the CMSP generally should consider having
policies and procedures that promote the onward transmission of messages among the relevant
parties to a transaction to ensure timely settlement and reduce the potential for errors. Similarly,
in structuring its process for submitting transactions for settlement, the CMSP generally should
consider ensuring that its systems, operational requirements, and the other choices it makes in
designing its services enable and incentivize prompt and accurate settlement without manual
intervention.
As explained above, the Commission recognizes it may not be technologically or
operationally practicable to eliminate all manual processes immediately. Indeed, the
Commission believes that in certain circumstances, the parties to a trade may need to engage in
manual interventions to ensure the accuracy of trade information and minimize operational or
other risks that may prevent settlement, and proposed Rule 17Ad-27 does not require CMSPs to
remove a manual processes if doing so would clearly undermine the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. However, pursuant to the policies and
procedures approach described above, where a CMSP continues to permit manual reconciliation
or other types of human intervention, it generally should explain in its policies and procedures
why those manual processes remain necessary as part of its systems and processes. In addition,
87
the CMSP should consider developing processes that ultimately would eliminate the underlying
issues that drive the use of manual processes in order to facilitate a more automated approach.
2. Annual Report on Straight-Through Processing
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 also would require a CMSP to submit every twelve months to
the Commission a report that describes the following: (a) the CMSP’s current policies and
procedures for facilitating straight-through processing; (b) its progress in facilitating straightthrough processing during the twelve month period covered by the report; and (c) the steps the
CMSP intends to take to facilitate and promote straight-through processing during the twelve
month period that follows the period covered by the report. The Commission preliminarily
intends to make this annual report publicly available on its website to enable the public to review
and analyze progress on achieving straight-through processing. A CMSP would submit this
report to the Commission using the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval system (“EDGAR”), and would tag the information in the report using the structured
(i.e., machine-readable) Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”).187
The Commission believes that the proposed reporting requirement would enable the
Commission to evaluate actions taken by the CMSP to ensure compliance with the rule and to
help fulfill the Commission’s responsibility for oversight of the National C&S System, both as it
relates to the CMSP specifically and the National C&S System more generally. The proposed
requirement would also inform the Commission and the public, particularly the direct and
 187 This requirement would be implemented by including a cross-reference to Regulation ST in proposed Rule 17Ad-27, and by revising Regulation S-T to include the proposed straightthrough processing reports. Pursuant to Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, the EDGAR Filer Manual
is incorporated by reference into the Commission’s rules. In conjunction with the EDGAR Filer
Manual, Regulation S-T governs the electronic submission of documents filed with the
Commission.
88
indirect users of the CMSP, as to the progress being made each year to advance implementation
of straight-through processing with respect to the allocation, confirmation, affirmation, and
matching of institutional trades, the communication of messages among the parties to the
transactions, and the availability of service offerings that reduce or eliminate the need for manual
processing. In particular, the Commission preliminarily believes that a CMSP generally should
include in its report a summary of key settlement data relevant to its straight-through processing
objective. Such data could include the rates of allocation, confirmation, affirmation, and/or
matching achieved via straight-through processing. In describing its progress in facilitating
straight-through processing, the CMSP could also identify common or best practices that
facilitate straight-through processing. In addition, after the CMSP has submitted its initial report,
in subsequent years a CMSP generally should include in its report an assessment of how its
progress in facilitating straight-through processing during the twelve month period covered by
the report under paragraph (b) compares to the steps it intended to take to facilitate straightthrough processing under paragraph (c) from the prior year’s report.
Because this information would be useful to the industry and the general public in
considering potential ways to increase the availability of straight-through processing, the
Commission believes that the report should be made public. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the proposed requirement generally would not require the disclosure of proprietary
information, trade secrets, or personally identifiable information. To the extent that an annual
report includes confidential commercial or financial information, a CMSP could request
confidential treatment of those specific portions of the report.
188
 188 See 17 CFR 240.24b-2.
89
As the National C&S System continues to evolve, the Commission believes that CMSPs
will continue to play an increasingly critical role in efforts to facilitate the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to eliminate inefficient and costly
procedures that effect the settlement of securities transactions, particularly institutional
transactions. Furthermore, because of the CMSP’s role in submitting matched or confirmed and
affirmed trades for overnight positioning of settling transactions, the Commission believes that a
CMSP generally should evaluate how it participates in that process and consider how it can
support improvements to the timing and manner of settlement obligations (e.g., intraday) to
increase efficiency in the National C&S System.
Requiring CMSPs to file the reports on EDGAR would provide the Commission and the
public with a centralized, publicly accessible electronic database for the reports, facilitating the
use of the reported data on straight-through processing. Moreover, requiring Inline XBRL
tagging of the reported disclosures, which would specifically comprise an Inline XBRL block
text tag for each of the three required narrative disclosures as well as detail tags for individual
data points, would make the disclosures more easily available and accessible to and reusable by
market participants and the Commission for retrieval, aggregation, and comparison across
different CMSPs and time periods, as compared to an unstructured PDF, HTML, or ASCII
format requirement for the reports.189 Detail tags could be helpful to the extent the reports
disclose individual data points, including the rates of allocation, confirmation, affirmation,
and/or matching achieved via straight-through processing.
 189 See Release No. 33-10514 (June 28, 2018), 83 FR 40846, 40847 (Aug. 16, 2018). Inline
XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL data directly into an HTML document, eliminating the need
to tag a copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit. Id. at 40851.
90
The Commission is proposing a 12-month requirement in the rule because the
Commission preliminarily believes that a yearly review and report on progress with respect to
straight-through processing is the appropriate timescale on which the CMSP should consider,
develop, and implement iterative improvements over time, while also ensuring that progress
towards straight-through processing is expeditious. Specifically, a 12-month period would
provide the CMSP with a sufficient look-back period to complete a meaningful review on an
organization-wide basis and time to test and implement material changes to technologies and
procedures. An annual reporting requirement, as opposed to a monthly or semi-annual
requirement, should help ensure that the information provided to the Commission reflects
meaningful and substantive progress by the CMSP, as opposed to focusing the Commission’s
attention on smaller, technical changes in services and policies that would be less relevant to
improving the Commission’s understanding of the overall progress towards achieving straightthrough processing by the CMSP. The Commission believes that the reporting requirement
should continue indefinitely because changes in technology will require ongoing review and
consideration of how such changes might impact policies and procedures to facilitate straightthrough processing.
3. Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad-27, as well as
the following specific topics:
53. Is the proposed policies and procedures approach appropriate and sufficient to achieve
the proposed rule’s stated objectives? Why or why not? Would more specific or
directive requirements, such as those discussed above be more effective at facilitating
straight-through processing than the proposed policies and procedures approach? Please
explain why or why not.
91
54. Is proposed Rule 17Ad-27 consistent with the approach to RVP/DVP settlement set forth
in FINRA Rule 11860 and, more generally, the UPC set forth in the FINRA Rule 11000
series?190 If not, please explain.
55. Is the proposed use of the term “straight-through processing” clear and understandable?
Why or why not? Should the Commission define the term for purposes of the proposed
rule? If so, please describe the elements that the Commission should consider including
in the definition to make it clear and understandable.
56. Should the Commission require a CMSP to enable the users of its service to complete the
matching, confirmation, or affirmation of securities transactions as soon as
technologically practicable? Alternatively, should the Commission impose a specific
deadline on such a requirement, such as requiring that these processes be completed
within a certain number of minutes or hours? Should the Commission require specific
deadlines, when using a CMSP, for completing each of the allocation, confirmation,
affirmation, or matching processes? Why or why not? If the Commission were to
impose a specific deadline, what would be the appropriate deadline for each process –
allocation, confirmation, affirmation, and matching?
57. Should the Commission require a CMSP to forward or otherwise submit a transaction for
settlement as soon as technologically and operationally practicable, as if using fully
automated systems? Should the Commission specify to whom a CMSP should forward
such information to facilitate straight-through processing? To what extent do CMSPs not
forward such trade information as soon as technologically practicable? Are certain
parties excluded? What are the reasons preventing such forwarding of trade information?
 190 See supra note 171 and accompanying text (describing the UPC).
92
58. Is it appropriate for proposed Rule 17Ad-27 to require a CMSP to retire any electronic
trade confirmation services, where the users of a CMSP may transmit sequential
messages back and forth to achieve allocation, confirmation, and affirmation of a
transaction? If so, should the rule be modified to accommodate electronic trade
confirmation services offered by CMSPs? Why or why not?
59. More generally, are electronic trade confirmation services consistent with the concept of
“straight-through processing?” Why or why not? Please explain.
60. With regard to the proposed requirement for a CMSP to provide an annual report, does
the proposed rule include the appropriate aspects or level of detail that should be included
in such a report? Why or why not? Should the Commission require that the public report
be issued in a machine-readable data language? Why or why not?
61. Are the time periods (i.e., every 12 months) described in the rule concerning the
submission and content of the annual report sufficiently clear? If not, please explain.
62. Should a CMSP be required to tag its annual report using Inline XBRL? Why or why
not? Rather than requiring block text tags for the narrative disclosures as well as detail
tags of individual data points (including those nested within the narrative disclosures),
should we only require block text tags for the narrative disclosures? Should the annual
report be tagged in an open structured data language other than Inline XBRL? If so, what
open structured data language should be used and why?
63. Is EDGAR an appropriate submission mechanism for the annual report? Why or why
not? Should the Commission use an alternative submission mechanism, such as the
Electronic Form Filing System (“EFFS”)? An EFFS submission requirement would not
93
be compatible with a requirement to use Inline XBRL or other open structured data
language for the annual report.
64. Should the Commission make public the annual report required to be submitted to the
Commission under the proposed rule? Why or why not? Would making the report
public alter the type or detail of information included by the CMSP in the report or in its
policies and procedures? If so, why? If the public availability of any information
required under the proposed rule would raise issues related to confidentiality or the
proprietary nature of the CMSP’s operations, please explain.
65. CMSPs generally allow their users to define the criteria that will constitute a “match,”
and the users may set different tolerances under those criteria depending on their business
strategy. Should a CMSPs be required to disclose in the annual report its matching
criteria? Should a CMSP be required to disclose data regarding confirmations,
affirmations, and/or matches in its annual report, such as the percentage of successful
confirmations, affirmations, and/or matches achieved on trade date, or the average time
users take to achieve confirmation, affirmation, and/or a match from trade submission?
Should a CMSP be required to disclose any other data to help facilitate straight-through
processing, such as average time to submit a trade to a registered clearing agency for
settlement, or the average number of messages that a CMSP transmits among the parties
to a trade before the trade is submitted to a registered clearing agency for settlement?
Please explain.
66. More generally, should CMSPs be required to make their policies and procedures for
straight-through processing public? Please explain why or why not?
94
67. The Commission has issued exemptive orders for three CMSPs, pursuant to which each
CMSP is subject to a series of operational and interoperability conditions.191 Should the
Commission amend the respective exemptive orders to add conditions similar to the
proposed requirements in Rule 17Ad-27 instead of adopting this proposal? Why or why
not?
68. In the Matching Release, the Commission stated that, even though matching services fall
within the Exchange Act definition of “clearing agency,” it was of the view that an entity
that limits its clearing agency functions to providing matching services need not be
subject to the full panoply of clearing agency regulation.192 The Commission offered two
alternative approaches for regulation: limited registration or conditional exemptions.
Since the Matching Release, the Commission has approved three conditional exemptions
for CMSPs, as noted in the above question, with the goal of facilitating competition in the
provision of matching services.193 Has the Commission’s approach to the regulation of
CMSPs facilitated competition in the provision of matching services? If so, why or why
not? To what extent does competition among CMSPs help promote either a shortened
settlement cycle or straight-through processing? Please explain.
 191 See supra note 32 (providing citations to the exemptive orders for DTCC ITP Matching,
BSTP, and SS&C).
192 Exchange Act Release No. 39829 (Apr. 6, 1998), 63 FR 17943, 17947 (Apr. 13, 1998)
(“Matching Release”).
193 See, e.g., BSTP and SS&C Order, supra note 32, at 75397–400 (noting the Commission’s
interest in facilitating competition among CMSPs).
95
69. Are there any other steps that the Commission should take to enhance the ability of the
CMSPs to promote straight-through processing or increase efficiency in the settlement of
securities transactions?
E. Impact on Certain Commission Rules and Guidance and SRO Rules
The proposed rules and rule amendments may affect compliance with other existing
Commission rules and guidance that reference the settlement cycle or settlement processes in
establishing requirements for market participants. Below is a preliminary list of rules identified
by the Commission. The Commission preliminarily believes that no changes to these rules are
necessary to adopt the proposed rules. The Commission solicits comment on the potential
impacts of shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 on each of the below rules.
1. Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act
As with the adoption of a T+2 standard settlement cycle, several provisions of Regulation
SHO may be impacted by shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 because certain provisions use
“trade date” and “settlement date” to determine the timeframes for compliance relating to sales
of equity securities and fails to deliver on settlement date. Since these references are not to a
particular settlement cycle (e.g., “T+2”), the timeframes for these provisions change in tandem
with changes in the standard settlement cycle.
a) Rule 204
Shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 would reduce the timeframes to effect
the closeout of a fail-to-deliver position under 17 CFR 242.204 (“Rule 204”).194 Under Rule
 194 17 CFR 242.204.
96
204,195 a participant of a registered clearing agency must deliver securities to a registered
clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale in any equity security by
settlement date, or if a participant has a fail-to-deliver position, the participant shall, by no later
than the beginning of regular trading hours on the applicable closeout date, immediately close
out the fail-to-deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.196
The applicable closeout date for a fail-to-deliver position differs depending on whether
the position results from a short sale, a long sale, or bona fide market making activity. If a failto-deliver position results from a short sale, the participant must close out the fail-to-deliver
position by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following
the settlement date.197 Under the current T+2 standard settlement cycle, the applicable closeout
date for short sales is required by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+3. In a T+1
settlement cycle, the existing closeout requirement for fail-to-deliver positions resulting from
short sales would be reduced from T+3 to T+2.198
 195 For purposes of Regulation SHO, the term “participant” has the same meaning as in
Section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(24). See Amendments to Regulation
SHO, Exchange Act Release No. 60388 (July 27, 2009), 74 FR 38266, 38268 n.34 (July 31,
2009) (‘‘Rule 204 Adopting Release’’). Section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act defines
“participant” to mean, when used with respect to a clearing agency, any person who uses a
clearing agency to clear or settle securities transactions or to transfer, pledge, lend, or
hypothecate securities. Such term does not include a person whose only use of a clearing agency
is (A) through another person who is a participant or (B) as a pledgee of securities.
196 17 CFR 242.204(a).
197 Id.
198 See 17 CFR 242.204(g)(1).
97
If a fail-to-deliver position results from a long sale or bona fide market making activity,
the participant must close out the fail-to-deliver position by no later than the beginning of regular
trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date.199 Under the
current T+2 standard settlement cycle, the closeout for long sales or bona fide market making
activity is required by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+5. If the Commission adopts
a T+1 standard settlement cycle, this closeout requirement would be shortened from T+5 to T+4.
b) Rule 200(g)
Shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 may also impact the application of 17
CFR 242.200(g) (“Rule 200(g)”). Specifically, a T+1 settlement cycle may change when a
broker-dealer would need to initiate a bona fide recall of a loaned security to be able to mark the
sale of such loaned but recalled security “long” for purposes of Rule 200(g)(1). Under Rule
200(g), a broker-dealer must mark all sell orders of any equity security as “long,” “short,” or
“short exempt.” 200 Rule 200(g)(1) stipulates that a broker-dealer may only mark a sale as “long”
if the seller is “deemed to own” the security being sold under 17 CFR 242.200 (a) through (f)
and either (i) the security is in the broker-dealer’s physical possession or control; or (ii) it is
reasonably expected that the security will be in the broker-dealer’s possession or control by
settlement of the transaction.201
The Commission has provided guidance on when a person that sells a loaned but recalled
security would be “deemed to own” the security and be able to mark the sale “long.”202 The
 199 See 17 CFR 242.204(a)(1), (a)(3).
200 See 17 CFR 242.200(g).
201 See 17 CFR 242.200(g)(1).
202 See Rule 204 Adopting Release, supra note 195, at n.55.
98
guidance was given when the standard settlement cycle was T+3. Under those circumstances,
the Commission indicated that, if a person that has loaned a security to another person sells the
security and a bona fide recall of the security is initiated within two business days after trade
date, the person that has loaned the security will be “deemed to own” the security for purposes of
Rule 200(g)(1), and such sale will not be treated as a short sale for purposes of Rule 204. The
Commission also stated that a broker-dealer may mark such orders as “long” sales provided such
marking is also in compliance with Rule 200(c) of Regulation SHO, and thus the closeout
requirement of Rule 204.
203
This guidance was predicated on the Commission’s belief that, under then current
industry standards, recalls for loaned securities would likely be delivered within three business
days after the initiation of a recall. In that case, a broker-dealer that initiated a bona fide recall
by T+2 would receive delivery of loaned securities by T+5 and then be able to close out any
failure to deliver on a “long” sale of the loaned but recalled securities by the beginning of regular
trading hours on T+6, as then required by Rule 204 in a T+3 environment.
Under a T+2 standard settlement cycle, the closeout period for sales marked “long” is
T+5, and so recalls of loaned securities need to be delivered by T+4 to be available to close out
any fails on sales marked “long” by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+5. To meet this
timeframe, a number of broker-dealers have securities lending agreements that set the period of
delivery for delivering loaned but recalled securities to two settlement days after initiation of a
recall. Under such an agreement, a bona fide recall by no later than T+2 would result in the
delivery of such loaned securities by T+4 and in time to close out any fails on sales marked long
by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+5. For those broker-dealers that lend securities
 203 See id.; see also 17 CFR 242.200(c).
99
pursuant to securities lending agreements that have a recall period of three business days after
recall, a broker-dealer would need to initiate a bona fide recall by T+1 to receive delivery of the
loaned security by T+4 and in time to close out any fails on sales marked long by the beginning
of regular trading hours on T+5.
If a T+1 settlement cycle is implemented, closeout of a failure of a sale marked “long”
would be required by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+4. With this further shortened
timeframe, recalls of loaned securities would need to be delivered by T+3 to be available to close
out any fails on sales marked “long” by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+4.
Accordingly, under a T+1 settlement cycle, broker-dealers that lend securities pursuant to a
recall period of three business days would need to initiate a bona fide recall on trade date (i.e.,
T+0), and those brokers that lend securities pursuant to a recall period of two business days
would need to initiate a bona fide recall by T+1, in order to close out any failure to deliver on
sales marked “long” by the beginning of regular trading hours in T+4. The Commission
understands, however, that under a T+1 standard settlement cycle, at least some broker-dealers
would be likely to modify their securities lending agreements to shorten the recall period to one
settlement day after the initiation of the recall.204 Under such agreements, a bona fide recall
would need to be initiated by T+2 in order to meet the applicable closeout period for long sales.
Figure 4 provides a diagram of close-out scenarios in a T+1 environment.

2. Financial Responsibility Rules under the Exchange Act
Certain provisions of the Commission’s broker-dealer financial responsibility rules205
reference explicitly or implicitly the settlement date of a securities transaction. For example,
paragraph (m) of Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 references the settlement date to prescribe the
timeframe in which a broker-dealer must complete certain sell orders on behalf of customers.206
Specifically, Rule 15c3-3(m) provides that if a broker-dealer executes a sell order of a customer
(other than an order to execute a sale of securities which the seller does not own) and if for any
 205 For purposes of this release, the term “financial responsibility rules” includes any rule
adopted by the Commission pursuant to Sections 8, 15(c)(3), 17(a) or 17(e)(1)(A) of the
Exchange Act, any rule adopted by the Commission relating to hypothecation or lending of
customer securities, or any rule adopted by the Commission relating to the protection of funds or
securities. The Commission’s broker-dealer financial responsibility rules include 17 CFR
240.15c3-1, 15c3-3, 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, 17a-11, and 17a-13.

reason whatever the broker-dealer has not obtained possession of the securities from the
customer within ten business days after the settlement date, the broker-dealer must immediately
close the transaction with the customer by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.207 In
addition, settlement date is incorporated into paragraph (c)(9) of Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1,208
which defines what it means to “promptly transmit” funds and “promptly deliver” securities
within the meaning of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(v) of Rule 15c3-1.209 The concepts of
promptly transmitting funds and promptly delivering securities are incorporated in other
provisions of the financial responsibility rules as well, including paragraphs (k)(1)(iii), (k)(2)(i),
and (k)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3,210 paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Rule 17a-5,211 and paragraph (a)(3) of
Rule 17a-13.212
The Commission acknowledges that shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 will
effectively reduce the number of days (from 12 business days to 11 business days) that a brokerdealer will have to obtain possession of customer securities before being required to close out a
customer transaction under Rule 15c3-3(m). The operations supporting the processing of
 207 However, paragraph (m) of Rule 15c3-3 provides that the term “customer” for the
purpose of paragraph (m) does not include a broker or dealer who maintains an omnibus credit
account with another broker or dealer in compliance with Rule 7(f) of Regulation T (12 CFR
220.7(f)).

customer orders by broker-dealers and the technology supporting those operations have
developed substantially since 1972, when the Commission adopted paragraph (m) of Rule 15c3-
3.213 Based on staff experience, the Commission believes that these developments have resulted
in a lower frequency of broker-dealers failing to obtain possession of the securities from their
customers within 10 business days after the settlement date. Therefore, the Commission believes
that these developments in technology and broker-dealer operations diminish the potential for
customers to be adversely affected by the change from 12 business days to 11 business days.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that the change from 12 business days to 11 business
days would not materially burden broker-dealers or their customers,214 and the Commission
believes that it is unnecessary to amend Rule 15c3-3(m), or any of the broker-dealer financial
responsibility rules, at this time.
The Commission solicits comment regarding the effect that shortening the standard
settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1 could have on the ability of broker-dealers to comply with the
Commission’s financial responsibility rules.
3. Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act
Providing customers with confirmations pursuant to Rule 10b-10 serves a significant
investor protection function.215 Confirmations provide customers with a means of verifying the
 213 See Broker-Dealers; Maintenance of Certain Basic Reserves, Exchange Act Release No.
9856 (Nov. 10, 1972), 37 FR 25224 (Nov. 29, 1972) (“Rule 15c3-3 Adopting Release”).

cycle on Rule 15c3-3).

103
terms of their transactions, alerting investors to potential conflicts of interest with their brokerdealers, acting as a safeguard against fraud, and providing investors a means to evaluate the costs
of their transactions and the quality of their broker-dealers’ execution.216
Although Rule 10b-10 does not directly refer to the settlement cycle, it requires that a
broker-dealer send a customer a written confirmation disclosing specified information “at or
before completion” of the transaction, which Rule 10b-10 defines to have the meaning provided
in the definition of the term in Rule 15c1-1 under the Exchange Act.
217 Generally, Rule 15c1-1
defines “completion of the transaction” to mean the time when: (i) a customer purchasing a
security pays for any part of the purchase price after payment is requested or notification is given
that payment is due; (ii) a security is delivered or transferred to a customer who purchases and
makes payment for it before payment is requested or notification is given that payment is due;
(iii) a security is delivered or transferred to a broker-dealer from a customer who sells the
security and delivers it to the broker-dealer after delivery is requested or notification is given that
delivery is due; or (iv) a broker-dealer makes payment to a customer who sells a security and
delivers it to the broker-dealer before delivery is requested or notification is given that delivery is
due.

104
When first adopting Rule 15c6-1 in 1993 to establish a T+3 settlement cycle, the
Commission noted that broker-dealers typically send customer confirmations on the day after the
trade date.219 When adopting a T+2 settlement cycle in 2017, the Commission stated that, while
broker-dealers may continue to send physical customer confirmations on the day after the trade
date, broker-dealers may also send electronic confirmations to customers on the trade date.
Accordingly, the Commission noted its belief that implementation of a T+2 settlement cycle
would not create problems with regard to a broker-dealer’s ability to comply with the
requirement under Rule 10b-10 to send a confirmation “at or before completion” of the
transaction, but acknowledged that broker-dealers would have a shorter timeframe to comply
with the requirements of Rule 10b-10 in a T+2 settlement cycle.220 With respect to a T+1
standard settlement cycle, the Commission similarly believes that T+1 would not create a
compliance issue for broker-dealers under Rule 10b-10, although broker-dealers would have a
further shortened timeframe to do so in a T+1 settlement cycle. In addition, as explained in Part
III.D, proposed Rule 15c6-2 also would not alter the requirements of Rule 10b-10.221
The Commission solicits comment on the extent to which the T+1 rule proposals may
impact compliance with Rule 10b-10. In the T+1 Report, the ISC recommends clarifying what
constitutes “delivery” for electronic confirmations under Rule 10b-10. The Commission has

220 T+2 Adopting Release, supra note 10, at 15579.
221 See supra Part III.B.1 (discussing the relationship between a “confirmation” under
proposed Rule 15c6-2 and existing Rule 10b-10).
105
previously provided such guidance.222 The Commission therefore solicits comment on whether
this guidance needs to be updated in a T+1 environment.
4. Prospectus Delivery and “Access Versus Delivery”
Broker-dealers have to comply with prospectus delivery obligations under the Securities
Act.
223 As discussed in Part III.A.4, Securities Act Rule 172 implements an “access equals
delivery” model that permits, with certain exceptions, final prospectus delivery obligations to be
satisfied by the filing of a final prospectus with the Commission, rather than delivery of the
prospectus to purchasers.224
 222 See generally Use of Electronic Media for Delivery Purposes, Exchange Act Release No.
36345 (Oct. 6, 1995) (“1995 Release”) (providing Commission views on the use of electronic
media to deliver information to investors, with a focus on electronic delivery of prospectuses,
annual reports to security holders and proxy solicitation materials under the federal securities
laws); Use of Electronic Media by Broker-Dealers, Transfer Agents, and Investment Advisers for
Delivery of Information, Exchange Act Release No. 37182 (May 9, 1996) (“1996 Release”)

electronic media to deliver documents on matters such as telephonic and global consent; issuer
liability for website content; and legal principles that should be considered in conducting online
offerings). Under the guidance, the Commission’s framework for electronic delivery consists of
the following elements: (1) notice to the investor that information is available electronically; (2)
access to information comparable to that which would have been provided in paper form and that
is not so burdensome that the intended recipients cannot effectively access it; and (3) evidence to
show delivery (i.e., reason to believe that electronically delivered information will result in the
satisfaction of the delivery requirements under the federal securities laws). See 1996 Release at
24646–47.
223 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act makes it unlawful to deliver
(i.e., as part of settlement) a security “unless accompanied or preceded” by a prospectus that
meets the requirements of Section 10(a) of the Act (known as a “final prospectus”). 15 U.S.C.
77e(b)(2).
224 15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(2); 17 CFR 230.172. Under Securities Act Rule 172(b), an obligation
under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act to have a prospectus that satisfies the requirements of
Section 10(a) of the Act precede or accompany the delivery of a security in a registered offering
106
The Commission preliminarily believes that, if a T+1 standard settlement cycle is
implemented, such a standard settlement cycle would not raise any significant legal or
operational concerns for issuers or broker-dealers to comply with the prospectus delivery
obligations under the Securities Act.
The Commission requests comment on whether commenters believe any specific legal or
operational concerns would arise for issuers or broker-dealers to comply with the prospectus
delivery obligations under the Securities Act if the settlement cycle is shortened to T+1. The
Commission asks that commenters identify specific examples of the circumstances in which such
legal or operational difficulties could occur.
The Commission also requests comment on the extent to which the T+1 rule proposals
may impact compliance with the prospectus delivery requirements under the Securities Act.
5. Changes to SRO Rules and Operations
As with the T+2 transition, the Commission anticipates that the proposed transition to
T+1 would again require changes to SRO rules and operations to achieve consistency with a T+1
standard settlement cycle. Certain SRO rules reference existing Rule 15c6-1 or currently define
“regular way” settlement as occurring on T+2 and, as such, may need to be amended in
connection with shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1. Certain timeframes or

is satisfied only if the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of Rule 172 are met. 17 CFR
230.172(b). Pursuant to Rule 172(d), “access equals delivery” generally is not available to the
offerings of most registered investment companies (e.g., mutual funds), business combination
transactions, or offerings registered on Form S-8. 17 CFR 230.172(d). The Commission
recently amended Rule 172 to allow registered closed-end funds and business development
companies to rely on the rule. See Securities Offering Reform for Closed-End Investment
Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 33836 (Apr. 8, 2020), 85 FR 33353 (June 1,
2020).
107
deadlines in SRO rules also may refer to the settlement date, either expressly or indirectly. In
such cases, the SROs may need to amend these rules in connection with shortening the
settlement cycle to T+1.225
Because the Commission is also proposing two other rule changes to facilitate a T+1
standard settlement cycle, SRO rules and operations may be affected to a greater extent than
occurred during the T+2 transition. For example, while elements of FINRA Rule 11860 could be
used to facilitate compliance with proposed Rule 15c6-2, FINRA Rule 11860 currently requires
that affirmations be completed no later than the day after trade date and may need to be amended
to align with the requirements in proposed Rule 15c6-2.
The Commission solicits comment on the extent to which the T+1 rule proposals may
impact existing SRO rules and operations.
F. Proposed Compliance Date
Industry planning and testing was critical to ensuring an orderly transition from a T+3
standard settlement cycle to T+2, and the Commission anticipates that planning and testing
would again be critical to ensuring an orderly transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle, if
adopted. Accordingly, the Commission recognizes that the compliance date for the above rule
proposals, if adopted, must allow sufficient time for broker-dealers, investment advisers, clearing
agencies, and other market participants to plan for, implement, and test changes to their systems,
operations, policies, and procedures in a manner that allows for an orderly transition. The
Commission also recognizes that the compliance date must provide sufficient time for brokerdealers and other market participants to engage in outreach and education regarding the
 225 The T+1 Report similarly indicates that SROs will likely need to update their rules to
facilitate a transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle. T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 35–36.
108
transition to ensure that, among other things, their customers, including individual retail
investors, have time to prepare for operational or other changes related to a T+1 standard
settlement cycle.
The Commission is mindful that failure to appropriately implement an orderly transition
to T+1, if a T+1 standard settlement cycle is adopted, may heighten certain operational risks for
the U.S. securities markets. However, the Commission is also mindful that delaying the
transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle further than is necessary would delay the realization
of the risk reducing and other benefits expected under a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
226 The
DTCC White Paper contemplated that a transition to T+1 is achievable in the second half of
2023,
227 and the T+1 Report states that a T+1 transition is achievable in the first half of 2024.
The T+1 Report estimates that planning for testing will begin in Q4 2022, that industry-wide
testing will begin in Q2 2023, and that industry-wide testing will need to occur for one full year
before implementation of a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
228 The T+1 Report also states that,
once “regulatory certainty and guidance is achieved, the industry anticipates a lengthy and
necessary amount of time will be required for T+1 implementation.”229
With these dates and considerations in mind, the Commission believes that market
participants should prepare expeditiously for a T+1 transition and proposes a compliance date of
 226 See infra Part V.C (discussing the anticipated benefits of a T+1 standard settlement
cycle).
227 DTCC White Paper, supra note 61, at 8.
228 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at Fig. 1.
229 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 6–7.
109
March 31, 2024.
230 If the proposed rules and rule amendments presented in this release are
adopted as proposed, the Commission believes that the systems and operational changes
necessary at the industry level can be planned, tested, and implemented in advance of March 31,
2024. Although the T+1 Report estimates that planning for testing will not begin until Q4 2022,
and that industry-wide testing will not begin until Q2 2023,231 the Commission believes that
market participants can implement a T+1 standard settlement cycle by the earlier end of the T+1
Report’s overall time table. Specifically, planning for testing could begin sooner than Q4 2022,
so that industry-wide testing can begin in early 2023 and conclude in early 2024, in advance of
the proposed compliance date.
70. The Commission solicits comment on whether the proposed March 31, 2024 compliance
date is appropriate for each of the four proposed rules (Rule 15c6-1, Rule 15c6-2, Rule
17Ad-27, and the amendment to Rule 204-2(a)). How many months would market
participants need to plan, test, and implement a transition to T+1? What data points
would market participants use to assess the timing for planning, testing, and
implementation? Are any specific operational or technological issues raised by the
proposed compliance date? To what extent does the proposed compliance date align or
not align with typical practices related to the planning and testing of systems or other
technology changes among affected parties, such as market participants, broker-dealers,
investment advisers, or clearing agencies? For example, to achieve a compliance date of
March 31, 2024, to what extent, if any, would these parties (and market participants more
 230 Notwithstanding the proposed compliance date, market participants could still coordinate
to establish an earlier T+1 transition date as needed to ensure effective planning, testing, and
implementation.

110
generally) have to consider an implementation date that is earlier than March 31, 2024?
Why? Please explain.
71. What is the extent of planning and testing necessary to achieve an orderly transition to a
T+1 standard settlement cycle, if adopted? In responding to this request for comment,
commenters should provide specific data and any other relevant information necessary to
explain the extent of industry-wide planning and testing that would be required to ensure
an orderly transition to the proposed T+1 settlement cycle by March 31, 2024.
72. The Commission has proposed a single compliance date applicable to each of the four
proposed rules. Would staggering the compliance dates for these rules help facilitate an
orderly transition to a T+1 settlement cycle, if adopted? For example, should the
compliance date for Rule 15c6-2, if adopted, fall before the compliance date for Rule
15c6-1, to ensure an orderly transition to a T+1 settlement cycle, if adopted? If
staggering would be appropriate, what would be an appropriate schedule of compliance
dates? Would staggering the compliance dates introduce impediments to an orderly T+1
settlement cycle transition? If so, please describe.
IV. Pathways to T+0
The Commission uses T+0 in this release to refer to settlement that is complete by the
end of trade date.232 This has sometimes been referred to as same-day settlement. In the
Commission’s preliminary view, same-day settlement could occur pursuant to at least three
different models: (i) netted settlement at the end of the day on T+0; (ii) real-time settlement,
where transactions are settled in real time or near real time and presumably on a gross basis (i.e.,
without any netting applied to reduce the overall number of open positions); and (iii) “rolling”
 232 See supra note 12 and accompanying text.
111
settlement, where trades are netted and settled intraday on a recurring basis. In this release, the
Commission uses T+0 to refer specifically to netted settlement at the end of the day on T+0. The
Commission believes that this model of same-day settlement is currently the most appropriate to
consider applying to the standard settlement cycle after implementation of T+1, if adopted,
because it retains a core element of the existing settlement infrastructure—namely, the
application of multilateral netting at the end of trade date to reduce the overall number of open
positions before completing settlement.233
The Commission preliminarily believes that implementing a T+0 standard settlement
cycle would have similar benefits of market, credit, and liquidity risk reduction that were
realized in the shortening of the settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2 and are expected in moving
from a T+2 to a T+1 standard settlement cycle. In particular, shortening from a T+2 standard
settlement cycle to a T+0 standard might result in a larger reduction in certain settlement risks
than would result from shortening to a T+1 standard because the risks associated with
counterparty default tend to increase with time.234 Similarly, because price volatility is a
concave function of time,235 the shorter settlement cycle in a T+0 environment will reduce
expected price volatility to a greater extent than in a T+1 environment.
236 In addition, assuming
 233 In Part IV.B, the Commission solicits comment on the merits of this model versus the
others described, as well as any other potential settlement models.
234 See T+2 Adopting Release, supra note 10, at 15598.
235 If price changes are uncorrelated across time periods then the variance of price change
over T periods is T times the variance over a single period. Therefore, the standard deviation of
price changes over T periods is T1/2 times the standard deviation over a single period.
236 See id.
112
constant trading volume, the volume of unsettled trades for a T+0 settlement cycle could be
roughly half that from a T+1 settlement cycle, and, as a result, for any given adverse movement
in prices, the financial losses resulting from counterparty default could be half that expected in a
T+1 settlement cycle.237
The Commission believes that now is the time to begin identifying potential paths to
achieving T+0. Thus, the Commission is actively assessing the benefits and costs associated
with accelerating the standard settlement cycle to T+0. As the securities industry plans how to
implement a T+1 standard settlement cycle, this process should include consideration of the
potential paths to achieving T+0 to help ensure that investments in new technology and
operations undertaken to achieve T+1 can maximize the value of such investments over the long
term. In this way, the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle can be a useful step in identifying
potential paths to T+0.
The Commission is also mindful of some perceived challenges to implementing a T+0
standard settlement cycle in the immediate future identified by market participants. As discussed
above,238 the T+1 Report states that T+0 is “not achievable in the short term given the current
state of the settlement ecosystem” and would require an “overall modernization” of modern-day
clearance and settlement infrastructure, changes to business models, revisions to industry-wide
regulatory frameworks, and the potential implementation of real-time currency movements to
facilitate such a change.
239 The T+1 Report identified “key areas” that industry groups
 237 See id.
238 See supra notes 76–79 and accompanying text.
239 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 10; see also supra notes 76–77 and accompanying text
(discussing the same).
113
determined would be impacted by a move to T+0 settlement, including re-engineering of
securities processing; securities netting; funding requirements for securities transactions;
securities lending practices; prime brokerage practices; global settlement; and primary offerings,
derivatives markets and corporate actions.
To advance the discussion of developing and achieving a T+0 standard settlement cycle,
the Commission solicits comment on potential approaches to overcoming the operational and
other barriers identified by market participants for shortening the standard settlement cycle
beyond T+1. Specifically, the Commission in Part IV.A discusses three potential approaches
that could be used to implement a T+0 settlement cycle, and solicits comment on all aspects of
the approaches described. The Commission also discusses in Part IV.B the operational and other
challenges that market participants have identified for implementing T+0, and solicits comment
on the building blocks necessary to address or resolve those challenges to enable a T+0
settlement cycle.
A. Possible Approaches to Achieving T+0
To facilitate discussion of T+0 settlement, the Commission has identified three possible
approaches or frameworks for considering how to implement T+0 settlement. These are
presented not as an exhaustive, complete, or discrete list of pathways but rather as example cases
that help illustrate the range of potential approaches, or combination of approaches, that might be
useful in facilitating investments that improve the efficiency of the National C&S System,
including the ability to implement a T+0 standard settlement cycle. The Commission provides
these examples to help facilitate comment on the implications of a T+0 standard settlement cycle
and the mechanics of implementation, as well as their potential impact on the challenges
identified in Part IV.B. Comments received will help inform any future proposals.
114
1. Wide-Scale Implementation
One possible path to shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0 involves a wide
effort, led by the Commission or an industry working group, to develop and publish documents
like the ISG White Paper, the T+2 Playbook, and now the T+1 Report, in which industry experts
identify the full set of potential impediments to T+0, propose solutions, and develop a timeline
for education, testing, and implementation.
While this approach would mirror past efforts to shorten the settlement cycle, it
necessarily requires industry-wide solutions to the impediments identified with respect to T+0,
such as those that may be related to the considerations in Part IV.B. For this reason, the
Commission believes that it may be helpful to consider two alternative paths to T+0: (i) an
approach where implementation begins first with technology and operational changes by key
infrastructure providers; and (ii) an approach where exchanges and clearing agencies offer pilots
or similar small-scale programs to establish T+0 as an optional settlement cycle in certain
circumstances.
2. Staggered Implementation Beginning with Key Infrastructure
An alternative approach to shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0 could begin
by focusing efforts on improving key settlement infrastructure to support wide-scale
implementation of T+0 settlement cycle. Such an approach could involve the development of
industry-led or academic research designed to identify the key improvements and to promote
engagement with respect to development and implementation.
Under this approach, a key assumption is that achieving a T+0 standard settlement cycle,
or the benefits anticipated from it, may not be possible until existing market infrastructure has
sufficient capacity to support the full range of market participants who would settle their
transactions on T+0, and that the challenges to achieving T+0 derive, in part, from insufficient
115
capacity or capability to serve those market participants. Infrastructure providers have used this
approach in the past to develop, test, and implement new technologies and services before widescale release. For example, as discussed in Part II.C, following implementation of a T+2
standard settlement cycle, DTCC began to pursue two sets of initiatives, accelerated settlement
and settlement optimization, designed to improve its own infrastructure to support more efficient
settlement processes. A similar effort following implementation of T+1 could identify
improvements to existing infrastructure that could address the challenges identified in Part IV.B.
For example, infrastructure providers like DTCC could explore mechanisms that expand the
availability of money settlement, as discussed further in Part IV.B.3, or reduce the timing
challenges associated with T+0 settlement, as discussed in Part IV.B.8.
3. Tiered Implementation Beginning with Pilot Programs
Exchanges and clearing agencies have often deployed new technologies in targeted
environments to test new functionality and service offerings on a small scale. This approach
could allow market participants to test T+0 settlement in a targeted environment, such as using a
specific exchange or exchanges, specific securities, and/or specific settlement services at a
registered clearing agency. SROs could consider pilot proposals that could help advance
development of the operational and technological resources necessary to enable T+0 settlement.
For example, DTCC began exploring the use of distributed ledger in 2015, completed its
Project ION case study in 2020,
240 and recently announced plans to deploy its ION platform
 240 See DTCC, Project ION Case Study (May 2020),
https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/settlement-asset-services/userdocumentation/Project-ION-Paper-2020.pdf.
116
through its “minimal viable product” pilot program.241 According to DTCC, the ION MVP
program is a mechanism for NSCC and DTC participants to test the use of distributed ledger
technology alongside “classic” settlement infrastructure at NSCC and DTC.242 Similarly, BOX
Exchange LLC recently implemented its Boston Security Token Exchange (“BSTX”) platform to
enable access to accelerated settlement for certain securities.243 In India, where the Securities
and Exchange Board of India recently announced plans to implement a T+1 settlement cycle, the
securities regulator plans to allow local stock exchanges to offer T+1 settlement on certain
securities, while retaining a T+2 settlement cycle for others. Each case presents examples where
new technologies are offered on a select basis, such as on certain exchanges or for certain
securities, in ways that could allow market participants to begin to adapt to T+0 settlement on an
incremental basis in a controlled environment.

Following Successful Pilot with Industry (Sept. 15, 2021),
https://www.dtcc.com/news/2021/september/15/dtccs-project-ion-platform-moves-todevelopment-phase-following-successful-pilot-with-industry.
242 See id. To the extent that elements of the ION MVP program constitute rules, policies, or
procedures of NSCC or DTC, it may be subject to the requirements for submitting proposed rule
changes under Section 19 of the Exchange Act and Rule 19b-4. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b); 17 CFR
240.19b-4. To the extent that this proposal would involve changes to rules, procedures, and
operations that could materially affect the nature or level of risk presented by NSCC or DTC,
they may also be required to submit an Advance Notice under the Dodd-Frank Act. See 12
U.S.C. 5465(e)(1)(A); 17 CFR 240.19b-4(n).
243 See Exchange Act Release No. 94092 (Jan. 27, 2022), 87 FR 5881 (Feb. 2, 2022) (order
approving a proposed rule change to adopt rules governing the listing and trading of equity
securities on BOX Exchange LLC through a facility of BOX Exchange LLC to be known as
BSTX LLC).
117
Such an approach potentially allows market participants to achieve T+0 without having to
first address all of the challenges described in Part IV.B for all market participants, instead
enabling experimentation and innovation to find solutions for certain segments over time. This
could help minimize one challenge noted in the T+1 Report: that T+0 would likely require the
adoption of new technologies, implementation costs that would disproportionately fall on small
and medium-sized firms that rely on manual processing or legacy systems and may lack the
resources to modernize their infrastructure rapidly.
244
B. Issues to Consider for Implementing T+0
Below the Commission describes several challenges identified as impediments to
implementing a T+0 standard settlement cycle, particularly in the short term. The Commission
requests comment on these challenges, as well as any comments identifying other challenges or
necessary building blocks associated with implementing T+0. More generally, with respect to
each of these topics, the Commission solicits comment on ways to improve the efficiency of and
reduce the risks that can result from the post-trade processes implicated by each of these
challenges. The Commission is particularly interested in commenters that identify potential
methods or building blocks that can enable T+0. In considering the below topics, the
Commission also requests that commenters assess whether the three approaches identified in Part
IV.A might affect the analysis of the below or otherwise reveal potential methods for addressing
and implementing them.
 244 See T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 10; see also supra notes 77–78 and accompanying text
(discussing the same); infra note 385 and accompanying text (noting that some benefits may
accrue to those market participants with high market power).
118
1. Maintaining Multilateral Netting at the End of Trade Date
As discussed in Part II.B.1, multilateral netting by the CCP is an essential feature of the
National C&S System. By substantially reducing the volume and value of transactions in equity
securities that need to be settled each day, CCP netting unlocks substantial capital efficiencies
for market participants while, at the same time, reducing credit, market, and liquidity risk in the
National C&S System. While the Commission continues to consider how new technologies and
business practices in the industry might further reduce risk and promote capital efficiency, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the capital efficiencies and risk reduction benefits that
result from the use of multilateral netting make it unlikely that market participants could costeffectively implement a T+0 standard settlement cycle without the continued use of multilateral
netting in some form.
245
In particular, at this time the Commission believes that a transition from T+1 settlement
to real-time settlement could not be achieved without substantial and significant changes to
fundamental elements of market structure and infrastructure because real-time settlement, to the
extent it requires gross settlement would prevent the use of, or significantly reduce the utility of,
multilateral netting before settlement. If market participants develop technologies and business
practices that can support the use of a real-time settlement system in the U.S. at some point in the
future, the Commission is interested in understanding how such technologies might interact with
existing infrastructure that provides multilateral netting. Indeed, retaining multilateral netting in
a T+0 environment poses challenges that include accommodating the submission of trades for
 245 See infra Part V.B.1 (discussing the capital efficiencies and risk reducing effects that
result from the use of multilateral netting).
119
clearing during and after the close of regular trading hours while still producing netting results
with sufficient time to enable market participants to position their cash and securities to achieve
final settlement before money settlement systems close for the day.
246 The Commission
observes that existing processes and computational tools used to complete the processing and
settlement of trades currently rely on significantly more time than the few hours between the
close of regular trading hours and the close of money settlement systems on a given day.
The Commission is interested in receiving public comments on both the utility of
centralized multilateral netting as a feature of the National C&S System and any potential
impediments or challenges associated with retaining such netting functionality while shortening
the settlement cycle to T+0. The Commission is also interested in receiving public comments on
potential benefits or costs associated with real-time settlement. In particular the Commission
requests comment on the following:
73. Is it possible to shorten the settlement cycle in the U.S. markets to T+0 and retain
multilateral netting? If so, what is the earliest time on T+0 that market participants could
be prepared to settle their trades without eliminating multilateral netting, and what
changes, if any, to existing netting processes would be necessary to move to a T+0
settlement cycle?
74. Could a real-time settlement model be successfully deployed in the National C&S System
in a way that compliments the use of multilateral netting? If yes, please explain. For
example, most institutional trades that use bank custodians generally are not submitted to
CNS for netting. Would it be possible to settle those trades in a real-time settlement
 246 Part IV.B.3 discusses existing limitations in money settlement infrastructure that may
contribute to this challenge.
120
model while other trading activity would continue to rely on multilateral netting?
Alternatively, would it be beneficial to find ways to move more institutional trades into
multilateral netting processes, such as by expanding access to multilateral netting systems
to custodians? Why or why not? What are the impediments to expanding access to
custodians?
75. If real-time settlement is not possible without eliminating or substantially curtailing
multilateral netting activity, please explain.
76. If real-time settlement is not compatible with multilateral netting, would the potential
benefits of real-time gross settlement still justify the elimination of multilateral netting in
the National C&S System? Please explain why or why not.
77. What impact would the elimination of multilateral netting have on capital demands (e.g.,
margin requirements) imposed on market participants in connection with their settlement
obligations? To the extent possible, please include any quantitative estimates or data that
may be relevant to the request for comment.
78. How would the elimination of multilateral netting impact overall levels of market,
liquidity and credit risk in the clearance and settlement system and how might such risks
be distributed among market participants?
79. Are there disadvantages to multilateral netting and, if so, what are they? Does
multilateral netting mandate the use of agreed timeframes to determine which trades will
be included in netting (for example, trades settling on or executed on a given day or
within a given hour)? Why or why not? Are there netting activities that currently only
happen once a day that might need to occur more often for trades to settle at the end of
121
trade date? If so, what are they and are there benefits, costs or risks to performing these
activities more than once a day?
80. Does multilateral netting foster or require the use of batch processing? Does multilateral
netting necessitate sequential processing activities that impede the adoption of same-day
settlement? Why or why not? For example, do introducing broker-dealers that maintain
omnibus accounts at clearing broker-dealers need to net their activity prior to submitting
net trades to their clearing broker-dealers who, in turn, have a dependency before being
able to calculate their own net figures? Are there computational or other technology
upgrades that could be employed to accelerate these processes so that they could continue
to function effectively under the shortened timeframes available in a T+0 environment?
Are there other settlement models, such as those deploying intraday or rolling settlement,
that could improve the settlement process in such a way that facilitates an effective
multilateral netting process at the end of the day in a T+0 environment?
2. Achieving Same-Day Settlement Processing
Moving settlement to the end of trade date would significantly compress the array of
operational activities and processes required to achieve settlement, raising questions about
whether the current arrangement of settlement processes can support T+0 settlement.
For example, in the current T+2 settlement environment, DTC processes certain
transactions for settlement during the day on settlement date and other transactions the night
before settlement date (“S-1”) during the so-called “night cycle,” which begins at 8:30 p.m. on S1. Processing transactions during the night cycle allows for earlier settlement of certain
transactions that are included in the night cycle, thereby reducing counterparty risk and, with
respect to transactions that are cleared through NSCC, enables such transactions to be removed
122
from members’ marginable portfolios, which in turn reduces such members’ NSCC margin
requirements.
DTC uses a process called the “Night Batch Process” to control the order of processing of
transactions in the night cycle.
247 During the Night Batch Process, DTC evaluates each
participant’s available positions, transaction priority and risk management controls, and
identifies the transaction processing order that optimizes the number of transactions processed
for settlement. The Night Batch Process allows DTC to run multiple processing scenarios until it
identifies an optimal processing scenario. At approximately 8:30 p.m. on S-1, DTC subjects all
transactions eligible for processing to the Night Batch Process, which is run in an “off-line”
batch that is not visible to participants, allowing DTC to run multiple processing scenarios until
the optimal processing scenario is identified. The results of the Night Batch Process are
incorporated back into DTC’s core processing environment on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
Because trade date and settlement date would be the same day in a T+0 environment,
shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 would require DTC and its participants to initiate
and complete their settlement processes much sooner relative to the time a trade is executed and
without the benefit of any overnight processes. Compressing timeframes to achieve T+0
settlement necessarily removes the ability to perform any settlement activities on S-1. This has
implications for how DTC conducts its existing “night cycle” process but, more broadly, for all
the market participants who collect trading information that feeds into the night cycle process
and any systems that they run overnight to prepare for settlement. Moving to a T+0 settlement
cycle would also impact the processing timeframes for corporate actions.
 247 See DTC, Settlement Service Guide, at 68 (June 24, 2021), https://www.dtcc.com/-
/media/Files/Downloads/legal/service-guides/Settlement.pdf.
123
The Commission requests public comment regarding the prospective impact that
shortening the settlement cycle to T+0 would have on settlement processes such as those
described above. In particular, the Commission requests comment on the following:
81. Would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 allow sufficient time for
settlement processes that are currently conducted by DTC and its participants to be
completed on a timeframe that is compatible with timely settlement? If not, why not?
82. When would be the optimal time to complete existing processes that occur on S-1 in a
T+0 environment? More generally, how would existing settlement processes that occur
on S-1 need to change to accommodate a T+0 standard settlement cycle?
83. What would be the impact on market participants (clearing agencies, broker-dealers, buy
side participants, retail investors, etc.) of any changes in processes necessary to
accommodate T+0?
84. What risks, if any, arise by the compression of the settlement cycle to accommodate T+0,
particularly as it relates to market, credit, liquidity, and systemic risk? What are the
associated costs of these risks? How might these risks affect the market, trading
behaviors, investors (both retail and institutional), and innovation? Is mitigation of these
risks feasible, and if so, how?
3. Enhancing Money Settlement
To achieve final settlement on settlement date, DTCC and its clearing agency participants
rely on access to two systems operated by the Federal Reserve Board, the National Settlement
Service and Fedwire.248 These systems settle the cash portions of securities transactions. Final
settlement at NSS and Fedwire currently must occur by 6:30 p.m., leaving little time in a T+0
 248 See id. at 18–19.
124
environment for market participants to settle their positions in an end-of-day process after most
major U.S. stock exchanges typically close at 4:00 p.m. Although Fedwire (but not NSS)
reopens at 9:00 p.m., payments posted are processed overnight and, like NSCC/DTC securities
movements processed during the night cycle, do not settle until the following day. NSS is
available throughout the trading day, although currently DTCC only makes use of it at defined
points during the day.
85. To achieve T+0, would NSS and FedWire services need to have their availability
expanded? If so, how? What timeframes (both minimum and desired standards) would
be necessary to accommodate T+0?
86. What other changes to NSS or FedWire, if any, would be necessary to accommodate a
T+0 settlement environment? If the available windows for NSS or FedWire were to
change, what changes would market participants need to make to their own systems and
processes to accommodate such changes?
87. Are there ways to manage the money settlement process in a T+0 environment that do not
require changes to NSS or FedWire? Please explain.
4. Mutual Fund and ETF Processing
Purchases and redemptions of shares of open-end mutual funds generally settle today on
a T+1 basis, except for certain retail funds and ETFs sold through intermediaries,
249 which
typically settle on T+2. For open-end funds, several mutual fund families offer investors the
ability to open an account directly with the fund’s transfer agent and trade through that account.
 249 ETFs are investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act. See 15
U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(1). Historically, ETFs have been organized as open-end funds or UITs.
125
In other cases, orders are placed with intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, banks and
retirement plan recordkeepers. Much of this intermediary activity is processed through DTCC’s
Fund/SERV system, in which intermediaries submit orders through Fund/SERV that are then
routed to mutual fund transfer agents to be executed at the current net asset value (“NAV”)
250
next calculated by the fund’s administrator after receipt of the order, pursuant to Rule 22c-1 of
the Investment Company Act.251 These orders may be submitted on an omnibus basis and in one
of three ways: as a request to purchase or redeem a given number of shares or units, as a request
to purchase or redeem a given U.S. dollar value, or as a request to exchange a given number of
shares / units or U.S. dollar value for another fund. Because the NAV becomes the ‘price’ for
each order, the net money to be paid or received at settlement cannot be calculated until after the
NAV has been calculated and published. Once the NAV is available, the transfer agent is able to
issue confirmations to the intermediaries acknowledging receipt and execution of the orders
submitted. For orders submitted as share quantities, the net confirmation includes not only the
quantity executed, but the net amount of money to be exchanged at settlement. For orders
submitted as U.S. dollar amounts, the transfer agent can calculate the quantity purchased or
redeemed and include it in the confirm. For exchanges of shares in one fund for shares in
another, the NAV of both funds is required to determine both the quantity and the net settlement
amount for each fund.
 250 See 17 CFR 270.2a-4 (defining “current net asset value”).
251 Open-end funds are required by law to redeem their securities on demand from
shareholders at a price approximating their proportionate share of the fund’s NAV at the time of
redemption. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-22(d).
126
In general, mutual fund families will utilize prices as of 4:00 p.m. ET to value the
underlying holdings in each fund for the current day.252 This is a critical input to the calculation
of the NAV and, as such, 4:00 p.m. ET is a dependency in the NAV calculation process. Prior to
4:00 p.m. ET, fund administrators are able to reconcile holdings to custodians, calculate and
apply any income and expense accruals, update the shares outstanding based on the prior day’s
purchase and redemption activity and in general prepare for the receipt of current-day prices.
Once those prices are available, fund administrators are able to apply prices to holdings, perform
a variety of validation checks on the prices and fund and ultimately calculate or “strike” the
NAV, then submitting or publishing the NAV to pricing vendors, newspapers and intermediaries.
This tends to occur between 6:00 p.m. ET and 8:00 p.m. ET.
Once the day’s NAV of a fund is available and each intermediary calculates the
settlement quantity or monetary amount for each order,
253 the intermediary aggregates and nets
the amount of money to be paid to or received from each fund’s agent bank. These values are
aggregated and netted to determine a single payment or receipt per bank and instructions are sent
to the intermediary’s bank to arrange for payments.
In the event an intermediary is an introducing broker, these introducing broker
calculations are then forwarded to the clearing broker, which, in turn, aggregates values received
from other introducing brokers as well as any of its own order activity. Ultimately the clearing
 252 As noted in Part IV.B.3, most major U.S. stock exchanges typically close at 4:00 p.m. ET
during standard (i.e., non-holiday) trading hours.
253 For example, if an order were placed as shares, the intermediary would multiply the share
quantity and the NAV to determine the amount of money to be paid or received. If an order were
placed as a dollar amount, the intermediary would divide this amount by the NAV to calculate
the share quantity traded. (These calculations may be further adjusted for commissions or other
fees.) Exchange transactions would require two calculations: one for the redemption side of any
exchange, and then a second calculation for the subscription side of the exchange.
127
broker determines a single net payment or receipt for each agent bank representing all of the
funds traded. The clearing broker must receive calculations for all its introducing brokers before
it can finalize its own calculations.
Given the current timing of NAV calculation and publication, we understand that many
market participants are not able to calculate net settlement amount or quantity traded until after
8:00 p.m. ET. This is 90 minutes later—to the extent this activity occurs on 8:00 p.m. ET—than
the time the Federal Reserve’s NSS system, which moves the cash necessary to effect settlement
of securities transactions, closes at 6:30 p.m.
254 Even when a NAV is available at 6:00 p.m. ET,
there is only a 30-minute window for intermediaries to obtain the NAV, calculate settlement
quantity or net amount, determine the net cash to be paid or received for each fund, further
determine the net payment or receipt for each agent bank across all funds traded and to submit
these values to NSS prior to its close at 6:30 p.m. ET. In addition, if the intermediary services
other intermediaries at another omnibus “tier,” such as a clearing broker servicing one or more
introducing brokers, the intermediary must wait on calculations from others before finalizing its
own numbers and submitting instructions. This sequential processing introduces a greater
number of activities that must occur in the approximately 30-minute window that would
typically be available for same-day settlement.
As noted earlier, to receive a given day’s NAV, intermediaries must receive orders prior
to the time at which the fund’s NAV is calculated, but intermediaries may not submit these
orders to Fund/SERV or the transfer agent until after the NAV calculation time, in some cases as
 254 See supra note 248 and accompanying text.
128
late as around 7:30 a.m. ET on T+1.255 The Commission understands this is often the case with
retirement plan recordkeepers who perform compliance and other checks on orders before they
are finalized for submission to Fund/SERV. Such timing would require modification to support
end of day settlement on T+0.
Unlike mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem individual shares. Instead, APs that
have contractual arrangements with the ETF purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the
ETF in blocks called “creation units.” An AP that purchases a creation unit of ETF shares
directly from the ETF deposits with the ETF a “basket” of securities and other assets identified
by the ETF that day, and then receives the creation unit of ETF shares in return for those assets.
After purchasing a creation unit, the AP may hold the individual ETF shares, or sell some or all
of them in secondary market transactions. The redemption process is the reverse of the purchase
process: the AP redeems a creation unit of ETF shares for a basket of securities and other assets.
Secondary market trading of ETF shares occurs at market-determined prices (i.e., at prices other
than those described in the prospectus or based on NAV), and the settlement values will be
known at the time of execution, similar to an exchange-traded equity security.256 Secondary
market ETF share transactions settle today on a T+2 basis. Currently, most securities in a
 255 Per a 2017 ICI survey based on 3Q 2016 data, only 70% of trade flow, including
estimated trade flow, is known by funds or their transfer agents around 5:00 p.m. ET and that
number remains rather constant until approximately 7:00 a.m. ET on T+1. See ICI, Evaluating
Swing Pricing: Operational Considerations, at 4 (June 2017),
https://www.ici.org/system/files/attachments/pdf/ppr_17_swing_pricing_summary.pdf.
256 Purchases and sales of ETFs in the secondary market may offset one another and do not
always result in a primary market transaction between the AP and the ETF to create or redeem
units.
129
“creation basket” settle in a similar timeframe (T+2) as the settlement time for a “creation unit,”
which is also the same as the settlement time for the ETF shares sold to APs, as well as ETF
shares traded in the secondary market.
NAVs are calculated for ETF shares in a manner similar to the process for open-end
mutual funds, with comparable times for capturing prices of underlying holdings and for
publishing the NAVs. Secondary market purchases and sales of ETF shares occur throughout
the business day and often occur at prices that differ from the ETF’s NAV.257 Those trading
ETF shares in the secondary market during the day will know their settlement amount almost
immediately, because the transaction price is the market price of the shares. Therefore,
secondary market ETF share transactions generally do not present the same challenges presented
by open-end mutual funds when considering same-day settlement.258
The Commission requests comment on the challenges open-end mutual funds and ETFs
might experience if U.S. markets were to adopt T+0 settlement.
 257 The combination of the creation and redemption process with secondary market trading
in ETF shares and underlying securities provides arbitrage opportunities that are designed to help
keep the market price of ETF shares at or close to the NAV per share of the ETF. See ExchangeTraded Funds, Investment Company Act Release No. 33646 (Sept. 25, 2019), 84 FR 57162,
57165 n.31 (Oct. 24, 2019).
258 We understand that some institutional investors may opt to place orders to trade ETFs at
the end-of-day NAV. These are generally placed with a market maker who may or may not be
an AP. The market maker will guarantee the end-of-day NAV price plus (or less) a fee
(depending on the direction of the trade) to cover transaction costs and profit. The market
makers can either trade with the institutional investor as a proprietary or principal trade or they
can submit a creation/redemption as agent on behalf of the institutional investor and
deliver/receive cash or the basket in exchange for the ETF shares. Under these circumstances,
secondary market investors in ETF shares would incur the same time compression described
above for open-end mutual funds to settle on a T+0 basis.
130
88. Are there additional factors that may negatively affect same-day settlement of open-end
mutual funds and ETFs that we have not described, and if so, what are they? Please
provide as much detail as possible.
89. Are fund administrators able to calculate and release NAVs any earlier while still relying
on 4:00 p.m. ET prices? What can they do to optimize their processes, including the
publication of the NAV?
90. Is our description of the netting across multiple omnibus “tiers”—and the subsequent
sequential processing that results—an accurate portrayal? If so, how many tiers might
exist that would necessitate sequential processes and how long might each tier be
expected to need to perform its calculations to pass on to the next tier? What factors
influence this processing? Are there potential solutions to this sequential processing
challenge and, if so, what are they? Are there ways in which intermediaries might
process information concurrently? If this description of netting across multiple omnibus
tiers does not capture current processes, please provide an explanation of the way(s) it
does occur today.
91. Could open-end mutual funds and ETFs settle on a T+1 basis even if other security types,
such as equities and corporate bonds, move to T+0 settlement? If so, what risks would be
introduced to open-end mutual funds and ETFs from holding positions in securities that
settle on a T+0 basis when trades of the fund’s shares occur on a T+1 basis? Should
these funds receive large amounts of purchases from investors, would they wait a day for
those purchase transactions to settle before investing cash in securities? Would they rely
on borrowing facilities and, if so, does that introduce new issues or risks? For large
131
redemption requests by investors, would these funds have additional time to liquidate
underlying holdings or would they increase their cash position in the interim?
92. Are there additional considerations for APs if securities in a creation basket settle on a
different basis than the shares of the ETF? What are the current risks and considerations
in this process where the securities in a creation basket settle on a different basis than the
shares of the ETF itself, such as is the case with U.S. Treasury securities, which
commonly settle on a T+1 basis today while the ETF shares settle on a T+2 basis?
93. What time do market intermediaries believe would be necessary for open-end mutual
funds and ETFs to publish NAVs in order to achieve same-day settlement and why?
94. What are the reasons intermediaries do not submit orders to purchase or sell mutual fund
shares to Fund/SERV or the transfer agent earlier on trade date? What are the reasons
some intermediaries may be delayed in the submission of those orders until T+1 in the
current environment? Please be as specific as possible and include data if available on
submission times. What would be needed to accelerate these timeframes?
95. Would open-end mutual funds potentially establish an earlier cut-off time for placing
orders to purchase or sell fund shares than is currently used (i.e., earlier than 4:00 p.m.
ET) to capture prices for NAV calculations, in order to speed the time at which a NAV
can be published? If so, what time might be most likely and why? If different funds
opted to use different times, would this create new market opportunities for funds? What
challenges would this introduce?
96. The Commission understands that some ETFs calculate NAVs more than once per day.
Are there unique challenges and opportunities these funds may have with same-day
settlement?
132
97. Currently, Rule 22c-1(a) of the Investment Company Act limits the ability to transact in
fund shares at a price other than “a price based on the current net asset value . . . which is
next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to
purchase or sell such security.” In the event a fund elects to calculate its NAV using
intra-day prices for the underlying securities held in the fund, such as utilizing 2:00 p.m.
ET prices to value its portfolio in order to produce a NAV earlier in the day to support
same-day settlement, how would this limitation impact the acceptance of orders to
purchase or redeem shares of the fund? Would a fund establish a cut-off time for
acceptance of orders that is based on the time when a snapshot of prices is captured to
value the fund’s securities positions? Would it be possible in different scenarios for
investors to have an information advantage and, if so, how? For funds that may currently
utilize prices for U.S. securities prior to the U.S. market close, how has such an approach
modified timelines and processes for acceptance of orders and publication of the NAV?
98. If different funds adopt differing policies for the time to capture prices or to publish
NAVs, and subsequently impose different cut-off times for receipt of orders pursuant to
Rule 22c-1, would intermediaries be able to accommodate such differences on a fundspecific basis?
99. Might funds consider requiring orders to be received by the fund’s transfer agent, rather
than an intermediary, by the cut-off time? Are there other ways in which a movement to
T+0 settlement would affect transfer agents’ processes, and if so, how should those
processes be changed?
133
100. If receipt by an intermediary is sufficient (as opposed to requiring orders be
received by the fund’s transfer agent by the cut-off time), as is the case today, how do
intermediaries or others monitor intermediary compliance?
101. Does monitoring of order receipt relative to cut-off times differ by types of
intermediaries? For example, are there different processes to monitor “authorized
agents” as opposed to other types of intermediaries? What are the differences between
“authorized agents” and other intermediaries?
102. If ETFs were to utilize an earlier time in the day to capture prices of their
portfolio investments for purpose of calculating the ETF’s shares’ NAV (that is, the price
that would form the basis for APs’ purchases and redemptions of creation units), how
would this affect primary market transactions in ETF shares? Would this affect secondary
market ETF share transactions in any way, for example, transactions by institutional
investors who may opt to place orders to trade ETFs at the end-of-day NAV?
103. Should the Commission consider elimination of omnibus processing to facilitate
the adoption of T+0 settlement for open-end mutual funds? Since any investor account
must be maintained by at least one party, how does omnibus accounting by intermediaries
rather than maintaining investor-specific accounts at each fund’s transfer agent reduce
costs to investors?
104. Are there any additional unique considerations for open-end mutual funds or
ETFs that hold non-U.S. securities if the Commission were to adopt a same-day
settlement standard while non-U.S. markets may continue with longer settlement
timeframes, including T+1 and T+2? What potential liquidity impacts might such funds
experience?
134
5. Institutional Trade Processing
As discussed throughout this release, while significant improvements to the infrastructure
for institutional trade processing have decreased reliance on manual activities and enabled more
transparency into and standardization of trade information, several operational and technology
challenges continue to limit the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of institutional trade processing,
all of which would be more acute in a T+0 environment.
As discussed previously, the T+1 Report recommends that allocations for all institutional
trades be made and communicated by 7:00 p.m. on trade date and these trades be confirmed and
affirmed by 9:00 p.m. ET on trade date.
259 The industry has identified a number of issues related
to the institutional trade process that would need to be addressed in a T+1 settlement cycle,
including, but not limited to, trade systems and reference data, the trade allocations, confirmation
and affirmation cut-off times, batch cycle timing, migration to trade date matching, and
identification of automated vendor solutions to alleviate manual processing.260 In addition,
improvements in the quality and standardization of settlement instructions, the quality of static
settlement data maintenance, the use of automation and the expansion of straight-through
processing capabilities would all help facilitate higher affirmation rates and faster processing.
 259 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 13; see also supra note 164 and accompanying text
(discussing the same). Additionally, the industry has recommended the adoption of Commission
or SRO rules requiring: (i) broker-dealers to obtain an agreement from their customers at the
outset of the relationship or at the time of the trade to participate in and to comply with the
operational requirements of interoperable trade-match systems as a condition to settling trades on
an RVP/DVP basis; and (ii) investment managers to participate in a trade-match system, similar
to the way broker-dealers and institutions are required by the SRO confirmation/affirmation rules
to participate in a confirmation/affirmation system.
260 See supra note 259.
135
As discussed in Part III.D, the Commission has previously explained that a shortened
settlement cycle may lead to increased reliance on the use of CMSPs, with a focus on improving
and accelerating the allocation, confirmation, and affirmation processes and enhancing
efficiencies in the services and operations of the CMSPs.
261 Improved automation in the
settlement process has enabled better straight-through processing and contributed to increases in
affirmation rates on trade date and increases in settlement rates, with an attendant decrease in
exceptions and fails. Moving to T+1 may promote continued improvements in technology and
operations, encourage incremental increases in the utilization by certain market participants of
CMSPs, and focus the industry on improving and accelerating the allocation, confirmation and
affirmation processes by completing those processes earlier and more efficiently.
However, it is unclear whether addressing these issues would (i) facilitate further
shortening of the settlement cycle beyond T+1; (ii) whether these issues would continue to be
relevant in a T+0 environment; or (iii) whether new technologies or operational processes would
need to be designed and implemented to accommodate T+0 for institutional trade processing.
Accordingly, the Commission is requesting comment on all issues pertaining to improving the
institutional trade processing in order to achieve a T+0 standard settlement cycle. In addition,
the Commission is seeking comment on the following:
105. What operational, technological and regulatory issues related to institutional trade
processing should be considered in further shortening of the settlement cycle to T+0,
particularly any impediments to investors and other market participants?
 261 See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69258.
136
106. What, if anything, should the Commission do to facilitate T+0, particularly as it
relates to the standardization of reference data, the use of standardized industry protocols
by broker-dealers, asset managers, and custodians, and the use of matching services?
107. Does moving to T+0 introduce any new risks in the processing of institutional
trades? If so, please describe such risks and whether mitigation is possible. Can such
risks be quantified?
108. What are the benefits and costs of settling institutional trades in a T+0
environment? What are the relative challenges for the different market participants
involved? Do the benefits of T+0 accrue to all participants—brokers, institutional
customers, custodians, or matching utilities? Do they accrue to large, medium, and small
entities?
109. How would the current systems and processes used in the institutional post-trade
process need to change to accommodate a T+0 settlement requirement?
110. Would any or all of the changes contemplated by the Industry Working Group to
address the building blocks considered essential for institutional trade settlement in T+1
be useful should the settlement cycle move to T+0?
111. How would the allocation, confirmation and affirmation process be accomplished
in a T+0 environment? In particular, what timeframes would be necessary to ensure
settlement on T+0? To what extent would the roles of CMSPs, broker-dealers, or bank
custodians need to change to accommodate T+0 settlement? To what extent does the use
of a custodian foster or impair a transition to a T+0 settlement cycle? Please explain.
137
112. What effect would T+0 have on the relationship between a broker-dealer and its
customer? What effect would T+0 have on the relationship between an investor and its
custodian?
6. Securities Lending
Both the ISG White Paper and the T+2 Playbook highlighted the potential impact
shortening the settlement to T+2 may have on securities lending practices in the U.S. For
example, the ISG White Paper noted that securities lenders may have less time to recall loaned
securities, and securities borrowers should be cognizant of the reduced timeframe between
execution and settlement when loaning securities, particularly when transacting in hard to
borrow securities.262 The ISC White Paper further stated that service providers may need to
update their products and services to accurately process such transactions.263
The T+2 Playbook included several recommendations regarding actions firms should take
to address the potential impact that shortening the standard settlement cycle may have on
securities lending practices in the industry. For example, the T+2 Playbook recommended that
market participants’ decisions to loan securities should take into account the shortened settlement
cycle, and stock borrow positions should be evaluated to reduce exposure to counterparty risk
based on the shortened settlement cycle.264 More recently industry working groups tasked with
understanding industry requirements for shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1 have
 262 ISG White Paper, supra note 26, at 26.
263 Id.
264 T+2 Playbook, supra note 27, at 86.
138
begun to analyze how shortening the settlement cycle may require additional changes to
securities lending practices.265
While market participants have yet to explore in significant detail how shortening the
settlement cycle to T+0 might impact securities lending practices in the U.S. markets, the
Commission preliminarily believes that such a move would likely impact these practices further,
and may necessitate further changes to procedures, operations and technologies that facilitate
securities lending and borrowing. Additionally, the Commission is interested in learning
whether shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 could impact overall liquidity in the
U.S. markets to the extent that market participants may curtail their participation in the securities
lending markets in response to such a move.
The Commission is requesting public comment regarding all aspects of the potential
impact that shortening the settlement cycle to T+0 could have on securities lending in the U.S.
In particular, the Commission requests comment on the following:
113. To what extent would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 make it
difficult for securities lenders to timely recall securities on loan?
114. To what extent would the Commission need to amend Regulation SHO to
accommodate securities lending in a T+0 environment? Are there changes to Regulation
SHO that can be made to help facilitate lending in a T+0 environment?
115. Please describe any technology changes that might be necessary to support
securities lending operations of market participants if the settlement cycle were shortened
to T+0. Please include in any comments descriptions of existing technologies that may
 265 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 24–25.
139
help the Commission identify and understand the limitations, if any, of such technologies
with respect to a T+0 settlement cycle.
116. With respect to stock loan recalls, are there ways to improve the level of
coordination between investment managers and third-party lending agents for underlying
funds, and to facilitate partial stock loan recalls from bulk lending positions aggregated
from multiple institutional investors?266
117. To what extent might securities lenders need to rely on predictive analytics to
make decisions regarding which securities to recall before lenders can be sure such
recalls will be necessary? What additional costs, if any, might be associated with the
increased use of predictive analytics?
118. How might shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 impact market
participants seeking to borrow securities in the U.S. markets? Please include discussion
regarding the possible impact on market participants’ ability to borrow securities that
might be difficult to borrow.
119. How might shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 impact the decisions
of securities lenders and borrows to lend and borrow securities, respectively?
120. What impact, if any, would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 have
on the cost of borrowing securities in the U.S.?
121. What impact would shortening the settlement cycle to T+0 have on costs related
to loaning securities (e.g., investments in technology improvements, analytics, etc.)?
 266 See, e.g., ISITC Virtual Winter Forum, Securities Lending Working Group discussion
(Dec. 13, 2021).
140
122. To what extent might shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 reduce
revenue securities lenders generate from loaning securities compared with a T+2 or T+1
settlement cycle?
123. What impact, if any, might a T+0 settlement cycle have on overall liquidity in the
U.S. markets if such a move were to reduce securities lending activity?
124. Please describe any indirect impact that shortening the standard settlement cycle
to T+0 might have on market structure or trading activity as a result of changes to
securities lending in the U.S. markets. For example, if shortening the settlement cycle to
T+0 would reduce the availability of difficult to borrow securities, how would such a
reduction impact short selling practices in the U.S. markets?
125. Please describe any other impacts that shortening the settlement cycle to T+0
might have on securities lending markets in the U.S.
7. Access to Funds and/or Prefunding of Transactions
A T+0 settlement cycle may increase prefunding requirements for investors, shifting
some costs from broker-dealers and banks to retail and institutional investors.267 When
purchasing securities in the U.S. market, retail and institutional investors must be ready to
provide cash to settle their securities transaction. Cash is typically held in a short-term sweep
account, such as a money market fund (MMF) or commingled vehicle, and therefore requires
that the investor redeem cash from the sweep vehicle to finance the securities transaction.
 267 This discussion concerns the settlement arrangements between investors and their brokers
or custodians. These arrangements are separate from obligations of brokers and custodians to
NSCC and DTC.
141
Alternatively, it may simply be held in a cash account. In some cases, funds will be converted to
USD from another currency through an FX transaction. The specific needs, timing and
arrangements vary for retail versus institutional investors. Retail investors may fund their
securities transactions using cash accounts, and in such cases FINRA rules permit the brokers to
require the payment of purchase money to be paid “upon delivery,”268 which functionally means
no later than settlement. Some brokers require their retail clients to prefund their transactions—
in other words, deposit sufficient cash for settlement in their brokerage account before the broker
acts on their orders and executes a purchase trade. Alternatively, retail clients may be permitted
to fund transactions through use of a margin account. An institutional investor is required,
pursuant to its contractual relationships with its brokers and custodians, to provide cash (or have
credit available) on the day that the custodian or broker receives the purchased securities and
credits them to the investor’s account.
In a T+0 environment, investors will not have time after markets close to identify and
obtain the cash necessary for settlement of a securities transaction, as settlement of the securities
transaction will occur on the same day. This could have a number of potential effects, and the
Commission is requesting comment on the following:
126. Will there be a significant increase in prefunding requirements for securities
transactions across market participants? Would some investors have to start planning in
advance before the trade date to accurately position necessary funds for redemption and
securities and cash for settlement? To what extent might retail investors alter their
funding behaviors or their use of margin accounts in response to added prefunding
requirements?
 268 See FINRA Rule 11330.
142
127. Would a prefunding requirement shift risk from the broker-dealer and bank
community to the investor, both retail and institutional?
128. To the extent that an investor would need to redeem shares of a money market
fund to receive cash to settle a separate securities transaction, how would such
redemptions be effected? Would redemptions of money market fund shares need to be
effected in the morning of T+0 to receive cash to settle a separate securities transaction
on the same day?
129. How would this affect the borrowing of cash from clearing members, prime
brokers, custodians, and other liquidity providers when an institutional investor cannot
successfully redeem funds or otherwise convert assets to cash in time to settle?
130. How would T+0 affect FX transactions used to finance the settlement of
transactions?
131. Could T+0 affect the volume of securities trading at various points throughout the
trading day?
8. Potential Mismatches of Settlement Cycles
The Commission preliminarily believes that shortening the standard settlement cycle to
T+0 could create mismatches between settlement timeframes in different markets, or could
increase the degree to which certain settlement timeframes may already be mismatched at the
time a T+0 settlement cycle might be implemented. For example, most major securities markets
in non-U.S. jurisdictions currently settle transactions on a T+2 basis, as do FX markets generally.
When the Commission amended Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1(a) in 2017 to shorten the standard
settlement cycle to T+2, several major securities markets had already adopted a T+2 settlement
143
cycle, and the move to T+2 in the U.S. harmonized large portions of the U.S. settlement cycle
with prevailing settlement cycles in those markets.
269
In the T+2 Adopting Release the Commission stated that the prospective harmonization
of the standard settlement cycle in the U.S. with settlement cycles in foreign markets that settle
transactions on a T+2 settlement cycle may reduce the need for some market participants
engaging in cross-border and cross-asset transactions to hedge risks stemming from mismatched
settlement cycles and reduce related financing and borrowing costs, resulting in additional
benefits.
270 The T+2 Adopting Release also noted that shortening the settlement cycle further
than T+2 at that time could increase funding costs for market participants who rely on the
settlement of FX transactions to fund securities transactions that settle regular way.271
Whether shortening the standard settlement cycle for securities transactions in the U.S. to
T+0 would in fact result in mismatched settlement cycles vis-à-vis major foreign securities
markets, or the settlement cycle for FX transactions, may depend on future developments that are
unknown at this time, including the extent to which settlement cycles in those markets might be
 269 See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69241–42.
270 T+2 Adopting Release, supra note 10, at 15574.
271 Id. at 15599. Both the T+2 Proposing Release and the T+2 Adopting Release stated that,
because the settlement of FX transactions occurs on T+2, market participants who seek to fund a
cross-border securities transaction with the proceeds of an FX transaction would, in a T+1 or
T+0 environment, be required to settle the securities transaction before the proceeds of the FX
transaction become available and would be required to pre-fund securities transactions in foreign
currencies. Under these circumstances, a market participant would either incur opportunity costs
and currency risk associated with holding FX reserves or be exposed to price volatility by
delaying securities transactions by one business day to coordinate settlement of the securities and
FX legs. Id.
144
shortening in response to the implementation of a shorter settlement cycle for securities in the
U.S., or in response to other future developments in global markets.
The Commission notes that mutual funds and investment advisers have invested in
markets with mismatched settlement cycles for many years.272 Many investors evaluate an
investment portfolio based on traded positions without reference to pending or actual settlement
because entitlement to trade, receive income or corporate actions and performance calculations
generally are based on trade-date information. Nonetheless, institutional and retail investors
alike often consider anticipated settlement dates when managing cash balances to ensure that
settlements do not conflict or create an unexpected shortfall of cash, or an unplanned event that
results in an uninvested cash balance.
The Commission is interested in receiving public comment regarding the impact a T+0
standard settlement cycle in the U.S. securities markets might have on global harmonization of
settlement cycles, including any indirect impact on market participants. Specifically the
Commission requests comment on the following:
132. Would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 in the U.S. securities
markets result in decreased harmonization of settlement cycles generally? Which
markets would be impacted by such decreased harmonization? Could solutions be
applied to mitigate the effects of de-harmonization? For example, to what extent could
other asset classes, such as FX, transition to a shorter settlement cycle? What are the
 272 As noted earlier, U.S. equities securities have moved from settling T+5 to T+3 and more
recently to T+2, while U.S. Treasury securities have settled on a T+1 basis throughout.
Portfolios that invest globally have encountered mismatched settlement cycles, especially prior
to October 6, 2014 when twenty-nine European markets moved to T+2 settlement in an effort to
harmonize settlement times in Europe. See European Central Securities Depositories
Association, A Very Smooth Transition to T+2, https://ecsda.eu/archives/3793.
145
impediments to shortening settlement cycles for these other asset classes? Could FX
transactions transition to a T+0 settlement cycle? Please explain.
133. Would certain non-U.S. markets move to a T+0 settlement cycle in response to a
prospective move to T+0 in the U.S.?
134. How might shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+0 in the U.S. impact
market participants who seek to fund cross-border transactions with the proceeds of an
FX transaction?
135. To what extent might any adverse impact from increased settlement cycle
mismatches be mitigated if the standard settlement cycle in the U.S. is shortened to T+1
prior to a move to a T+0 standard settlement cycle at a later time?
136. To what extent might monitoring of anticipated settlement-date balances change if
the U.S. moved to a T+1 settlement cycle? How would such monitoring be impacted if
the U.S. moved to a T+0 standard settlement cycle?
9. Dematerialization
Currently the vast majority of securities asset classes trading in the U.S. markets,
including government securities, options, most mutual fund securities, and some municipal
bonds, are issued in book-entry form only (i.e., dematerialized).273 In contrast, other asset
classes, such as listed equities, unlisted equities that have been admitted as DTC-eligible, and
 273 Dematerialization of securities occurs where securities owned by an investor are not
represented by paper certificates, and transfers of ownership of those securities are made through
book-entry movements. For more information on issues related to the use of certificates in the
U.S. Markets, see Concept Release, supra note 149, at 12932–34.
146
some debt securities, can be immobilized274 using DTC and dematerialized using the Direct
Registration System (“DRS”) services enabled by DTC’s facilities, but many issuers of these
equity and debt securities continue to allow their investors to obtain paper certificates.
275
 274 Immobilization of securities occurs where the underlying certificate is kept in a securities
depository (or held in custody for the depository by the issuer's transfer agent) or at a custodian
and transfers of ownership are recorded through electronic book-entry movements between the
depository or custodian’s internal accounts. These types of securities are often referred to as
being held in “street name.” An issue is partially immobilized (as is the case with most equity
securities traded on an exchange), when the street name positions beneficially owned by
investors are linked through chains of beneficial ownership through intermediaries (such as
brokers) to the certificate immobilized at the securities depository, but certificates are still
available to investors directly registered on the issuer’s books. Id. at 12931 n.107; see also
Exchange Act Release No. 76743 (Dec. 22, 2015), 80 FR 81948, 81952 n.39 (Dec. 31, 2015).
275 DRS facilitates and automates the process whereby an investor, generally in equities, can
establish a direct book-entry position registered in the investor’s own name on the issuer’s
master securityholder file; such DRS issues are maintained by 61 transfer agents (as of
December 31, 2021) that have been admitted to DRS by DTC (out of a total, as of September 30,
2021, of 403 registered transfer agents). Where an issuer has authorized ownership in bookentry form and is serviced by a transfer agent that has been admitted by DTC as DRS-eligible
and an investor currently holds the securities in street name form in the investor’s broker-dealer
account, the investor can arrange, assuming the broker-dealer supports DRS servicing at DTC, to
have its securities electronically withdrawn from the account and forwarded to the transfer agent.
The procedure avoids the risks and custodial costs of moving certificates; in response to the
investor’s instruction to the broker-dealer, the investor’s shares are changed into DRS form when
the transfer agent receives an electronic file from DTC specifying the investor’s details supplied
by the broker-dealer, cancels the prior registration in the name of DTC’s Cede & Co. nominee,
and re-registers the securities directly in the investor’s name, with the investor receiving a
statement. Conversely, if the investor later elects to transfer the securities back to the investor’s
broker-dealer account (i.e., change the form of ownership of the securities from DRS back into
street-name form held through the broker-dealer account), the investor most commonly would
request the broker-dealer to withdraw the securities from DRS, with the transfer agent reregistering the securities in the name of DTC’s nominee, and the broker-dealer crediting the
securities to the investor’s account. Some frictions remain: DRS is not authorized by all issuers
and not available for all registered securities types; a number of the transfer agents for DTCeligible issues do not meet DTC’s qualifications to participate in DRS; some brokers may not
support DRS transfers or promptly process investors’ instructions to facilitate the transfer of
securities into DRS form. See Concept Release, supra note 139, at 12932.
147
While the U.S. markets have made significant strides over the past twenty years in
achieving immobilization and dematerialization, many industry representatives believe that the
small percentage of securities held in certificated form impose unnecessary risk and expense to
the industry and to investors.276 Moreover, the ISG previously identified the dematerialization of
securities certificates as a necessary building block to achieve shorter settlement timeframes.
277
The industry has long asserted that, despite the reduction in the use of paper certificates in the
U.S. markets, certificates continue to pose risks, create inefficiencies and increase costs,278 many
of which will be exacerbated as the settlement cycle shortens. Fully transitioning from paper
certificates to book-entry (i.e., electronic records) would not only contribute to a more costeffective, efficient, secure, and resilient marketplace by addressing operational issues related to
 276 The processing of paper securities certificates has long been identified as an inefficient
and risk-laden mechanism by which to hold and transfer ownership. Because paper certificates
require manual processing and multiple touchpoints between investors and financial
intermediaries, their use can result in significant delays and expenses in processing securities
transactions and can raise risk concerns associated with lost, stolen, and forged certificates. See
id. at 12930–31; Transfer Agents Operating Direct Registration System, Exchange Act Release
No. 35038 (Dec. 1, 1994), 59 FR 63652, 63653 (Dec. 8, 1994) (“1994 Concept Release”); see
also SIA Business Case Report, supra note 21, at 10; BCG Study, supra note 22, at 59, 62;

Recommendations, Submitted to The Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange

278 Id. DTCC estimates that only a small portion of securities positions remains certificated
and states that requests for certificates are declining, but also explains that the risks and costs
associated with processing the remaining certificates in the marketplace are substantial and
avoidable. See DTCC 2020 Dematerialization White Paper, supra note 276, at 4.

record-keeping, inventory management, resilience and controls, but would facilitate a more
efficient transition to shorter settlement cycles.
279
The Commission has long advocated a reduction in the use of certificates in the trading
environment by immobilizing or dematerializing securities and has acknowledged that the use of
certificates increases the costs and risks of clearing and settling securities for all parties
processing the securities, including those involved in the National C&S System.280 Most of
these costs and risks are ultimately borne by investors.281 For example, in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, DTC suspended all physical securities processing services for
approximately six weeks to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 among its
employees, who would otherwise be on site at DTC’s vault that holds physical securities on
deposit.282 While this service disruption did not affect the electronic book-entry settlement of
 279 See DTCC 2020 Dematerialization White Paper, supra note 276, at 11.
280 Concept Release, supra note 149, at 12934. The Commission also stated in the Concept
Release that, while investors should have the ability to register securities in their own names, it
was time to explore ways to further reduce certificates in the trading environment due to the
significant risk, inefficiency, and cost related to the use of securities certificates. Id. The
possibility exists that investors' attachment to the certificate may be based more on sentiment
than need, particularly in light of the fact that today non-negotiable records of ownership (e.g.,
account statements) evidence ownership of not only most securities issued in the U.S. but also
other financial assets, such as money in bank accounts. See id. at 12934–35. DRS allows an
investor to have securities registered in the investor’s name without having a certificate issued to
the investor and the ability to electronically transfer securities between the investor’s brokerdealer and the issuer’s transfer agent without the risk and delays associated with the use of
certificates. Id. at 12932.

securities transactions, DTC instituted alternative methods of handling certain transactions, such
as the use of letters of possession and an emergency rider in connection with underwriting new
securities issues.283
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of continuing to immobilize or
dematerialize the U.S. market to decrease risks and costs associated with physical certificates,
but the Commission preliminarily believes that dematerialization is not a prerequisite to
shortening the settlement cycle. Mechanisms in place today to facilitate immobilizing paper
certificates can adequately address the risk and efficiency issues associated with such certificates
(as evidenced by the COVID-19 example above), and can accommodate shorter settlement
cycles, up to and including T+0. In particular, DRS provides a viable alternative to street-name
holding for those investors who do not want to hold securities at a broker-dealer or who want
their securities registered in their own name.
284 Investors can use the linkages enabled by DTC
to transfer their securities back and forth between DRS at the transfer agent and book-entry form
on the books of a broker-dealer as it suits their needs.
285
 283 See, e.g., DTCC, Important Notice (Mar. 12, 2020), https://www.dtcc.com/-
/media/Files/pdf/2020/3/13/13099-20.pdf.
284 Due to the expanded use in today’s market, DRS is considered a viable alternative to
holding physical certificates, allowing transfers to be made relatively quickly and without the
risk and delays associated with the use of certificates. See DTCC 2020 Dematerialization White
Paper, supra note 276, at 4 n.2.
285 Specifically, DTC participants can use the linkages enabled by DTC and qualified FAST
transfer agents to withdraw securities electronically. Upon the investor’s request, a broker can
use DRS, if available for the particular securities issue, to transfer securities from the broker’s
account (where it is in DTC’s nominee registration) to be held in an investor’s own name on the
transfer agent’s book. DTC’s balance in that security drops and the investor receives a statement
of its holdings, rather than a certificate.
150
The key issues appear to be processing time and access to transfers between DRS at the
transfer agent and book-entry form at the broker-dealer. With regard to processing time, the
Commission is concerned that broker-dealer processes, whereby an investor requests that its
broker-dealer change the investor’s form of ownership from certificate form into street name
form at the broker-dealer, can take days or weeks. Those processing timeframes will need to be
significantly compressed or completed in real time to accommodate T+0. Broker-dealers might
require investors to complete the process of transferring paper certificates into book-entry either
through the transfer agent or the broker-dealer prior to trade execution, thereby allowing the
broker-dealer assurances the securities can be delivered in time for settlement. With regard to
access, only investors who have an issuer and transfer agent that offer DRS services can move
their securities between DRS at the transfer agent and book-entry form at the broker-dealer.
The Commission is seeking comment on these issues, as well as a number of other issues
related to the consideration of dematerialization as a building block to achieving T+0.
137. Is the elimination of the paper certificate necessary to achieve T+0? If so, why?
If not, why?
138. Would further dematerialization, immobilization, or some combination thereof,
without the elimination of the paper certificate, be sufficient to facilitate a T+0 settlement
cycle? Please describe how and why this would or would not be the case.
139. If further dematerialization or immobilization is necessary to achieve T+0
settlement, what needs to be done on either an operational or regulatory basis to achieve
such an objective? Please be as specific as possible, particularly where your answer
relates to regulatory initiatives. For example, should the Commission consider
mandating the dematerialization of certain types of securities? If so, which securities?
151
Should such a mandate be limited to securities traded on an exchange, or focused on
particular asset classes?
140. Should any potential requirements regarding dematerialization be imposed in
stages or, instead, be comprehensive from the outset? For example, should such
requirements be phased by addressing: (i) first, newly listed companies, (ii) then, new
issues of securities by all listed companies, and (iii) all outstanding securities?
141. In order to better accommodate a T+0 environment, what changes, if any, would
need to be made to broker-dealer processes for responding to investor requests to transfer
investors’ paper certificates into holdings in street-name book-entry form at the brokerdealer?
142. Do laws in other jurisdictions present any barriers to achieving complete
dematerialization, such as laws that require an issuer to issue certificates or prohibit
book-entry ownership? If so, please describe the jurisdictions and the specific laws that
raise potential issues.
143. What are the costs and benefits with requiring investors who hold paper
certificates to complete the transfer of such securities into book-entry prior to the
execution of a trade?
V. Economic Analysis
The Commission is mindful of the economic effects that may result from the proposed
amendments, including the benefits, costs, and the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
152
formation.286 This section analyzes the expected economic effects of the proposed rules relative
to the current baseline, which consists of the current market and regulatory framework.
This economic analysis begins with a discussion of the risks inherent in the settlement
cycle and how a reduction in the cycle’s length may affect the management and mitigation of
these risks. Next, it discusses market frictions that potentially impair the ability of market
participants to shorten the settlement cycle in the absence of a Commission rule. These
settlement cycle risks and market frictions frame our subsequent analysis of the rule’s benefits
and costs. The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to Exchange
Act Rule 15c6-1(a) and the proposed deletion of Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1(c) ameliorate some
or all of these market frictions and thus reduce the risks inherent in the settlement process.
The Commission preliminarily believes that, to successfully shorten the settlement
timeframes to T+1 while minimizing settlement fails in the institutional trade processing
environment, will require further enhancing automation, standardization, and the percentage of
trades that are allocated, confirmed, and affirmed by the end of the trade date.
287 To this end the
Commission is also proposing (i) new Rule 15c6-2 to require that, where parties have agreed to
 286 Exchange Act Section 3(f) requires the Commission, when it is engaged in rulemaking
pursuant to the Exchange Act and is required to consider or determine whether an action
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection
of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). In addition, Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) requires the
Commission, when making rules pursuant to the Exchange Act, to consider among other
matters the impact that any such rule would have on competition and not to adopt any
rule that would impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
287 See supra Part III.B.2; infra Part V.C.
153
engage in an allocation, confirmation, or affirmation process, a broker or dealer would be
prohibited from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other
than an exempted security, a government security, a municipal security, commercial paper,
bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) on behalf of a customer unless such broker or dealer
has entered into a written agreement with the customer that requires the allocation, confirmation,
affirmation, or any combination thereof, be completed no later than the end of the day on trade
date in such form as may be necessary to achieve settlement in compliance with Rule 15c6-
1(a),
288 (ii) an amendment to Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act to require investment advisers
that are parties to agreements under Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2 to maintain a time stamped
record of confirmations received, and when allocations and affirmations were sent to a broker or
dealer,
289 and (iii) new Rule 17Ad-27 under the Exchange Act to require policies and procedures
that require CMSPs facilitate the ongoing development of operational and technological
improvements associated with institutional trade processing, which may in turn also facilitate
further shortening of the settlement cycle in the future.290
The discussion of the economic effects of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the
proposed deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c), the proposed Rule 15c6-2, the proposed amendment to
Rule 204-2, and the proposed Rule 17Ad-27 begins with a baseline of current practices. The
economic analysis then discusses the likely economic effects of the proposal as well as its effects
on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The Commission has, where practicable,
attempted to quantify the economic effects expected to result from this proposal. In some cases,
 288 See supra Part III.B.
289 See supra Part III.C.
290 See supra Part III.D.
154
however, data needed to quantify these economic effects is not currently available or otherwise
publicly available. As noted below, the Commission is unable to quantify certain economic
effects and solicits comment, including estimates and data from interested parties, that could help
inform the estimates of the economic effects of the proposal.
A. Background
As previously discussed, the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would prohibit,
unless otherwise expressly agreed to by both parties at the time of the transaction, a brokerdealer from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of certain securities that
provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the first business day after the
date of the contract subject to certain exceptions provided in the rule. In its analysis of the
economic effects of the proposal, the Commission has considered the risks that market
participants, including broker-dealers, clearing agencies, and institutional and retail investors are
exposed to during the settlement cycle and how those risks change with the length of the cycle.
The settlement cycle spans the time between when a trade is executed and when cash
and securities are delivered to the seller and buyer, respectively. During this time, each party
to a trade faces the risk that its counterparty may fail to meet its obligations to deliver cash or
securities. When a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to deliver cash or securities, the
non-defaulting party may bear costs as a result. For example, if the non-defaulting party
chooses to enter into a new transaction, it will be with a new counterparty and will occur at a
potentially different price.291 The length of the settlement cycle influences this risk in two
 291 This applies to the general case of a transaction that is not novated to a CCP. As
described above, in its role as a CCP, NSCC becomes counterparty to both initial parties to a
centrally cleared transaction. In the case of such transactions, while each initial party is not
exposed to the risk that its original counterparty defaults, both are exposed to the risk of CCP
default. Similarly, the CCP is exposed to the risk that either initial party defaults.
155
ways: (i) through its effect on counterparty exposures to price volatility, and (ii) through its
effect on the value of outstanding obligations.
First, additional time allows asset prices to move further away from the price of the
original trade. For example, in a simplified model where daily asset returns are statistically
independent, the variance of an asset’s return over t days is equal to t multiplied by the daily
variance of the asset’s return. Thus when the daily variance of returns is constant, the variance
of returns increases linearly in the number of days.292 In other words, the more days that elapse
between when a trade is executed and when a counterparty defaults, the larger the variance of
price change will be, and the more likely that the asset’s price will deviate from the execution
price. The price change could be positive or negative, but in the event of a price increase, the
buyer must pay more than the original execution price, and in the event of a price decrease, the
buyer may buy the security for less than the original execution price.293
Second, the length of the settlement cycle directly influences the quantity of
transactions awaiting settlement. For example, assuming no change in transaction volumes, the
volume of unsettled trades under a T+1 settlement cycle is approximately half the volume of
unsettled trades under a T+2 settlement cycle.294 Thus, in the event of a default, counterparties
 292 More generally, because total variance over multiple days is equal to the sum of daily
variances and variables related to the correlation between daily returns, total variance increases
with time so long as daily returns are not highly negatively correlated. See, e.g., Morris H.
DeGroot, Probability and Statistics 216 (Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1986).
293 Similarly, a seller whose counterparty fails faces similar risks with respect to the security
price but in the opposite direction.
294 The relationship is approximate because some trades may settle early or, if both
counterparties agree at the time of the transaction, settle after the time limit in Rule 15c6-1(a).
156
would have to enter into a new transaction, or otherwise close out approximately half as many
trades under a T+1 standard settlement cycle than under a T+2 standard. This means that for a
given adverse move in prices, the financial losses resulting from a counterparty default will be
approximately half as large under a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
Market participants manage and mitigate settlement risk in a number of specific
ways.295 Generally, these methods entail costs to market participants. In some cases, these
costs may be explicit. For instance, clearing brokers typically explicitly charge introducing
brokers to clear trades. Other costs are implicit, such as the opportunity cost of assets posted as
collateral or limits placed on the trading activities of a broker’s customers.
The Commission acknowledges that, given current trading volumes and complexity,
certain market frictions may prevent securities markets from shortening the settlement cycle in
the absence of regulatory intervention. The Commission has considered two key market frictions
related to investments required to implement a shorter settlement cycle. The first is a
coordination problem that arises when some of the benefits of actions taken by one or more
market participants are only realized when other market participants take a similar action. For
example, under the current regulatory structure, if a particular institutional investor were to make
a technological investment to reduce the time it requires to match and allocate trades without a
corresponding action by its clearing broker-dealers, the institutional investor cannot fully realize
the benefits of its investment, as the settlement process is limited by the capabilities of the
clearing agency for trade matching and allocation. More generally, when every market
participant must bear the costs of an upgrade for the entire market to enjoy a benefit, the result is
 295 See T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69251 (discussing the entities that compose
the clearance and settlement infrastructure for U.S. securities markets).
157
a coordination problem, where each market participant may be reluctant to make the necessary
investments until it can be reasonably certain that others will also do so. In general, these
coordination problems may be resolved if all parties can credibly commit to the necessary
infrastructure investments. Regulatory intervention is one possible way of coordinating market
participants to undertake the investments necessary to support a shorter settlement cycle. Such
intervention could come through Commission rulemaking or through a coordinated set of SRO
rule changes.
In addition to coordination problems, a second market friction related to the settlement
cycle involves situations where one market participant’s investments result in benefits for other
market participants. For example, if a market participant invests in a technology that reduces the
error rate in its trade matching, not only does it benefit from fewer errors, but its counterparties
and other market participants may also benefit from more robust trade matching. However,
because market participants do not necessarily take into account the benefits that may accrue to
other market participants (also known as “externalities”) when market participants choose the
level of investment in their systems, the level of investment in technologies that reduce errors
might be less than efficient for the entire market. More generally, underinvestment may result
because each participant only takes into account its own costs and benefits when choosing which
infrastructure improvements or investments to make, and does not take into account the costs and
benefits that may accrue to its counterparties, other market participants, or financial markets
generally.
Moreover, because market participants that incur similar costs to move to a shorter
settlement cycle may nevertheless experience different levels of economic benefits, there is
likely heterogeneity across market participants in the demand for a shorter settlement cycle. This
158
heterogeneity may exacerbate coordination problems and underinvestment. Market participants
that do not expect to receive direct benefits from settling transactions earlier may lack incentives
to invest in infrastructure to support a shorter settlement cycle and thus could make it difficult for
the market as a whole to realize the overall risk reduction that the Commission believes a shorter
settlement cycle may bring.
For example, the level and nature of settlement risk exposures vary across different types
of market participants. A market participant’s characteristics and trading strategies can influence
the level of settlement risk it faces. For example, large market participants will generally be
exposed to more settlement risk than small market participants because they trade in larger
volume. However, large market participants also trade across a larger variety of assets and may
face less idiosyncratic risk in the event of counterparty default if the portfolio of trades that may
have to be replaced is diversified.296 As a corollary, a market participant who trades a single
security in a single direction against a given counterparty may face more idiosyncratic risk in the
event of counterparty failure than a market participant who trades in both directions with that
counterparty.
Furthermore, the extent to which a market participant experiences any economic benefits
that may stem from a shortened standard settlement cycle likely depends on the market
participant’s relative bargaining power. While larger intermediaries may experience direct
 296 See Ananth Madhavan et al., Risky Business: The Clearance and Settlement of Financial
Transactions 4–5 (U. Pa. Wharton Sch. Rodney L. White Ctr. for Fin. Res. Working Paper No.
40-88, 1988), https://rodneywhitecenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2014/04/8840.pdf; see also John H. Cochrane, Asset Pricing 15 (Princeton Univ.
Press rev. ed. 2009) (defining the idiosyncratic component of any payoff as the part that is
uncorrelated with the discount factor).
159
benefits from a shorter settlement cycle as a result of being required to post less collateral with a
CCP, if they do not effectively compete for customers through fees and services as a result of
market power, they may pass only a portion of these cost savings through to their customers.297
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a),
which would shorten the standard settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1 may mitigate the market
frictions of coordination and underinvestment described above. The Commission believes that
by mitigating these market frictions and for the reasons discussed below, the transition to a
shorter standard settlement cycle will reduce the risks inherent in the clearance and settlement
process.
The shorter standard settlement cycle might also affect the level of operational risk in the
National C&S System. Shortening the settlement cycle by one day would reduce the time that
market participants have to resolve any errors that might occur in the clearance and settlement
process. Tighter operational timeframes and linkages required under a shorter standard
settlement cycle might introduce new fragility that could affect market participants, specifically
an increased risk that operational issues could affect transaction processing and related securities
settlement.298
 297 See infra Parts V.C.1 (Benefits) and V.C.2 (Costs).
298 For example, the ability to compute an accurate net asset value (“NAV”) within the
settlement timeframe is a key component for settlement of ETF transactions. See, e.g.,
Barrington Partners White Paper, An Extraordinary Week: Shared Experiences from Inside the
Fund Accounting Systems Failure of 2015 (Nov. 2015), https://www.mfdf.org/docs/defaultsource/fromjoomla/uploads/blog_files/sharedexperiencefromfasystemfailure2015.pdf.
160
In part to lessen the likelihood that shortening the settlement cycle might negatively
affect operational risk, the Commission and market participants have emphasized on multiple
occasions the importance of accelerating the institutional trade clearance and settlement process
by improving, among other things, the allocation, confirmation and affirmation processes for the
clearance and settlement of institutional trades, as well as improvements to the provision of
central matching and electronic trade confirmation.299 A 2010 DTCC paper published when the
standard settlement cycle in the U.S. was still T+3, described same-day affirmation as “a
prerequisite” of shortening the settlement cycle because of its impact on settlement failure rates
and operational risk.300 According to previously cited statistics published by DTCC in 2011
regarding affirmation rates achieved through industry utilization of a certain matching/ETC
provider, on average, 45% of trades were affirmed on trade date, 90% were affirmed by T+1, and
92% were affirmed by noon on T+2.301 Currently, only about 68% of trades achieve affirmation
by 12:00 midnight at the end of trade date.302 While these numbers have improved over time,
the improvements have been incremental and fallen short of achieving an affirmed confirmation
by the end of trade date as is considered a securities industry best practice.303 Accordingly, and
as described more fully below, to achieve the maximum efficiency and risk reduction that may
result from completing the allocation, confirmation and affirmation process on trade date, and to
facilitate shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 or shorter, the Commission is proposing new

303 See supra note 57.
161
Rule 15c6-2 under the Exchange Act to facilitate trade date completion of institutional trade
allocations, confirmations and affirmations.
B. Economic Baseline and Affected Parties
The Commission uses as its economic baseline the clearance and settlement process as it
exists at the time of this proposal. In addition to the current process that is described in Part II.B
above, the baseline includes rules adopted by the Commission, including Commission rules
governing the clearance and settlement system, SRO rules,304 as well as rules adopted by
regulators in other jurisdictions to regulate securities settlement in those jurisdictions. The
following section discusses several additional elements of the baseline that are relevant for the
economic analysis of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) because they are related to the
financial risks faced by market participants that clear and settle transactions and the specific
means by which market participants manage these risks.
1. Central Counterparties
NSCC, a subsidiary of DTCC, is a clearing agency registered with the Commission that
operates the CCP for U.S. equity securities transactions.305 One way that NSCC mitigates the
 304 Certain SRO rules currently define “regular way” settlement as occurring on T+2 and, as
such, would need to be amended in connection with shortening the standard settlement cycle to
T+1. See, e.g., MSRB Rule G-12(b)(ii)(B); FINRA Rule 11320(b). Further, certain timeframes
or deadlines in SRO rules key off the current settlement date, either expressly or indirectly. In
such cases, the SROs may also need to amend these rules. See supra Part III.E.5 (further
discussing the impact of the proposal on SRO rules and operations).
305 A second DTCC subsidiary, DTC, also a clearing agency registered with the
Commission, operates a CSD with respect to securities transactions in the U.S. in several types
of eligible securities including, among others, equities, warrants, rights, corporate debt and notes,
municipal bonds, government securities, asset-backed securities, depositary receipts and money
market instruments.
162
credit, market, and liquidity risk that it assumes through its novation and guarantee of trades as a
CCP is by multilateral netting of securities trades’ delivery and payment obligations across its
members. By offsetting its members’ obligations, NSCC reduces the aggregate market value of
securities and cash it must deliver to clearing members. While netting reduces NSCC’s
settlement payment obligations by a daily average of 98%,306 it does not fully eliminate the risk
posed by unsettled trades because NSCC is responsible for payments or deliveries on any trades
that it cannot fully net. NSCC reported clearing an average of approximately $2.251 trillion each
day during the first quarter of 2021,307 suggesting an average net settlement obligation of
approximately $45 billion each day.308
The aggregate settlement risk faced by NSCC is also a function of the probability of
clearing member default. NSCC manages the risk of clearing member default by imposing
certain financial responsibility requirements on its members. For example, as of 2021, brokerdealer members of NSCC that are not municipal securities brokers and do not intend to clear and
settle transactions for other broker-dealers must have excess net capital of $500,000 over the
minimum net capital requirement imposed by the Commission and $1,000,000 over the
minimum net capital requirement if the broker-dealer member clears for other broker-dealers.
309
 306 See supra note 62.
307 See NSCC, Q1 2021 Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and NSCC Quantitative
Disclosure for Central Counterparties, at 20 (June 2021), http://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-andcompliance.
308 Calculated as $2.251 trillion × 2% = $45.02 billion.
309 For a description of NSCC’s financial responsibility requirements for registered brokerdealers, see NSCC Rules and Procedures, at 336 (effective Jan. 24, 2022) (“NSCC Rules and
Procedures”), https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf.
163
Furthermore, each NSCC member is subject to other ongoing membership requirements,
including a requirement to furnish NSCC with assurances of the member’s financial
responsibility and operational capability, including, but not limited to, periodic reports of its
financial and operational condition.310
In addition to managing the member default risk, NSCC also takes steps to mitigate the
impacts of a member default. For example, in the normal course of business, CCPs are generally
not exposed to market or liquidity risk because they expect to receive every security from a seller
they are obligated to deliver to a buyer and they expect to receive every payment from a buyer
that they are obligated to deliver to a seller. However, when a clearing member defaults, the
CCP can no longer expect the defaulting member to deliver securities or make payments. CCPs
mitigate this risk by requiring clearing members to make contributions of financial resources to
the CCP so that it may make payments or deliver securities in the event of a member default.
The level of financial resources CCPs require clearing members to commit may be based on,
among other things, the market and liquidity risk of a member’s portfolio, the correlation
between the assets in the member’s portfolio and the member’s own default probability, and the
liquidity of the assets posted as collateral.
2. Market Participants – Investors, Broker-Dealers, and Custodians
As discussed in Part II.B, broker-dealers serve both retail and institutional customers.

Pursuant to Rule 11 and Addendum K to NSCC’s Rules and Procedures, NSCC guarantees the
completion of CNS settling trades (“NSCC trade guaranty”) that have been validated. Id. at 74-
79, 363.
310 See, e.g., id. at 89.
164
Aggregate statistics from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System suggest that at
the end of the second quarter 2021, U.S. households held approximately 40% of the value of
corporate equity outstanding, and 57% of the value of mutual fund shares outstanding, which
provide a general picture of the share of holdings by retail investors.311
In the third quarter of 2021, approximately 3,500 broker-dealers filed FOCUS Reports312
with FINRA. These firms varied in size, with median assets of approximately $1.3 million and
average assets of approximately $1.5 billion. The top 1% of broker-dealers held 81% of the
assets of broker-dealers overall, indicating a high degree of concentration in the industry. Of the
approximately 3,500 filers, as of the end of 2020, 156 reported self-clearing public customer
accounts, while 1,126 reported acting as an introducing broker and sending orders to another
broker-dealer for clearing and not self-clearing. Broker-dealers that identified themselves as
self-clearing broker-dealers, on average, had higher total assets than broker-dealers that
identified themselves as introducing broker-dealers. While the decision to self-clear may be
based on many factors, this evidence is consistent with the argument that there may currently be
high barriers to entry for providing clearing services as a broker-dealer.
Clearing broker-dealers face liquidity risks as they are obligated to make payments to
clearing agencies on behalf of customers who purchase securities. As discussed in more detail
below, because customers of a clearing broker may default on their payment obligations to the
 311 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statistical Release Z.1, Financial
Accounts of the United States: Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic
Accounts, at 130 (Sept. 23, 2021), available at
https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20210923/z1.pdf.
312 FOCUS Reports, or “Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single” Reports, are
monthly, quarterly, and annual reports that broker-dealers generally are required to file with the
Commission and/or SROs pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-5, 17 CFR 240.17a-5.
165
broker, particularly when the price of a purchased security declines before settlement, clearing
broker-dealers routinely seek to reduce the risks posed by their customers. For example, clearing
broker-dealers may require customers to contribute financial resources in the form of margin to
margin accounts, to pre-fund purchases in cash accounts, or may restrict the use of customers’
unsettled funds. These measures are in many ways analogous to measures taken by clearing
agencies to reduce and mitigate the risks posed by their clearing members. In addition, clearing
broker-dealers may also mitigate the risks posed by customers by charging higher transaction
fees that reflect the value of the customer’s option to default, thereby causing customers to
internalize the cost of default that is inherent in the settlement process.313 While not directly
reducing the risk posed by customers to clearing members, these higher transaction fees at least
allocate to customers a portion of the expected direct costs of customer default.
Another way the settlement cycle may affect transaction prices involves the potential use
of funds during the settlement cycle. To the extent that buyers may use the cash to purchase
securities during the settlement cycle for other purposes, they may derive value from the length
of time it takes to settle a transaction. Testing this hypothesis, studies have found that sellers
demand compensation for the benefit that buyers receive from deferring payment during the
settlement cycle and that this compensation is incorporated in equity returns.314
The settlement process also exposes investors to certain risks. The length of the

settlement cycle sets the minimum amount of time between when an investor places an order to
sell securities and when the customer can expect to have access to the proceeds of that sale.
Investors take this into account when they plan transactions to meet liquidity needs. For
example, under T+2 settlement, investors who experience liquidity shocks, such as unexpected
expenses that must be met within one day, could not rely on obtaining funding solely through a
sale of securities because the proceeds of the sale would not typically be available until the end
of the second day after the sale. One possible strategy to deal with such a shock under T+2
settlement would be to borrow to meet payment obligations on day T+1 and repay the loan on
the following day with the proceeds from a sale of securities, incurring the cost of one day of
interest. Another strategy that investors may use is to hold financial resources to insure
themselves from liquidity shocks.
3. Investment Companies and Investment Advisers
Shares issued by investment companies may settle on different timeframes. ETFs, certain
closed-end funds, and mutual funds that are sold by brokers generally settle on T+2.315 By
contrast, mutual fund shares that are directly purchased from the fund generally settle on T+1.
Mutual funds that settle on a different basis than the underlying investments currently face
liquidity risk as a result of a mismatch between the timing of mutual fund share transaction
settlement and the timing of fund portfolio security transaction order settlements. Mutual funds
may manage these particular liquidity needs by, among other methods, using cash reserves, backup lines of credit, or interfund lending facilities to provide cash to cover the settlement
 315 See supra note 84.
167
mismatch.316 As of the end of 2020, there were 11,323 open-end funds (including money market
funds and ETFs).317 The assets of these funds were approximately $29.3 trillion.318 Of the
11,323 funds noted, 2,296 were ETFs with combined assets of $5.5 trillion.319
Under Section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act, an open-end fund generally is
required to pay shareholders who tender shares for redemption within seven days of their
tender.320 Open-end fund shares that are sold through broker-dealers must be redeemed within
two days of a redemption request because broker-dealers are subject to Rule 15c6-1(a).
Furthermore, Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act,321 the “forward pricing”
rule, requires funds, their principal underwriters, and dealers to sell and redeem fund shares at a
price based on the current NAV next computed after receipt of an order to purchase or redeem
fund shares, even though cash proceeds from purchases may be invested or fund assets may be
sold in subsequent days in order to satisfy purchase requests or meet redemption obligations.

Based on Investment Adviser Registration Depository data as of December 2020,
approximately 13,804 advisers registered with the Commission are required to maintain copies
of certain books and records relating to their advisory business. The Commission further
estimates that 2,521 registered advisers required to maintain copies of certain books and records
relating to their advisory business would not be required to make and keep the proposed required
records because they do not have any institutional advisory clients.322 Therefore, the remaining
11,283 of these advisers, or 81.74% of the total registered advisers required to maintain copies of
certain books and records relating to their advisory business, would enter a contract with a broker
or dealer under proposed Rule 15c6-2 and therefore be subject to the related proposed
amendment to Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act (i.e., to retain copies of confirmations
received, and any allocation and each affirmation sent, with a date and time stamp for each
allocation (if applicable) and affirmation that indicates when the allocation or affirmation was
sent to the broker or dealer).
4. Current Market for Clearance and Settlement Services
As described in Part II.B, two affiliated entities, NSCC and DTC, facilitate clearance and
settlement activities in U.S. securities markets in most instances. There is limited competition in
the provision of the services that these entities provide. NSCC is the CCP for trades between
broker-dealers involving equity securities, corporate and municipal debt, and UITs for the U.S.
market. DTC is the CSD that provides custody and book-entry transfer services for the vast
majority of securities transactions in the U.S. market involving equities, corporate and municipal
 322 See infra note 425.
169
debt, money market instruments, ADRs, and ETFs. CMSPs electronically facilitate
communication among a broker-dealer, an institutional investor or its investment adviser, and the
institutional investor’s custodian to reach agreement on the details of a securities trade, thereby
creating binding terms.
323 As discussed further in Part III.D, FINRA currently requires brokerdealers to use a clearing agency, such as DTC or a CMSP, or a qualified vendor under the rule to
complete delivery-versus-payment transactions with their customers.324
Broker-dealers compete to provide services to retail and institutional customers. Based
on the large number of broker-dealers, there is likely a high degree of competition among brokerdealers. However, the markets that broker-dealers serve may be segmented along lines relevant
for the analysis of competitive effects of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). As noted
above, the number of broker-dealers that self-clear public customer accounts is smaller than the
set of broker-dealers that introduce and do not self-clear. This could mean that introducing
broker-dealers compete more intensively for customers than clearing broker-dealers. Further,
clearing broker-dealers must meet requirements set by NSCC and DTC, such as financial
responsibility requirements and clearing fund requirements. These requirements represent
barriers to entry for brokers that may wish to become clearing broker-dealers, limiting
competition among such entities.
Competition for customers affects how the costs associated with the clearance and
settlement process are allocated among market participants. In managing the expected costs of
risks from their customers and the costs of compliance with SRO and Commission rules, clearing
broker-dealers decide what fraction of these costs to pass through to their customers in the form
 323 See supra Part II.B.1; see also T+2 Proposing Release, supra note 30, at 69246.
324 See supra note 181 and accompanying text.
170
of fees and margin requirements, and what fraction of these costs to bear themselves. The level
of competition that a clearing broker-dealer faces for customers will dictate the extent to which it
is able to pass these costs through to its customers.
In addition, several factors affect the current levels of efficiency and capital formation in
the various functions that make up the market for clearance and settlement services. First, at a
general level, market participants occupying various positions in the clearance and settlement
system must post or hold liquid financial resources, and the level of these resources is a function
of the length of the settlement cycle. For example, NSCC collects clearing fund contributions
from members to help ensure that it has sufficient financial resources in the event that one of its
members defaults on its obligations to NSCC. As discussed above, the length of the settlement
cycle is one determinant of the size of NSCC’s exposure to clearing members. As another
example, mutual funds may manage liquidity needs by, among other methods, using cash
reserves, back-up lines of credit, or interfund lending facilities to provide cash. These liquidity
needs, in turn, are related to the mismatch between the timing of mutual fund transaction order
settlements and the timing of fund portfolio security transaction order settlements.
Holding liquid assets solely for the purpose of mitigating counterparty risk or liquidity
needs that arise as part of the settlement process could represent an allocative inefficiency. That
is, because firms that are required to hold these assets might prefer to put them to alternative uses
and because these assets may be more efficiently allocated to other market participants who
value them for their fundamental risk and return characteristics rather than for their value as
collateral. To the extent that any intermediaries between buyer and seller who facilitate
clearance and settlement of the trade bear costs as a result of inefficient allocation of collateral
assets, these inefficiencies may be reflected in higher transaction costs.
171
The settlement cycle may also have more direct impacts on transaction costs. As noted
above, clearing broker-dealers may charge higher transaction fees to reflect the value of the
customer’s option to default and these fees may cause customers to internalize the cost of the
default options inherent in the settlement process. However, these fees also make transactions
more costly and may influence the willingness of market participants to efficiently share risks or
to supply liquidity to securities markets. Taken together, inefficiencies in the allocation of
resources and risks across market participants may serve to impair capital formation.
Finally, market participants may make processing errors in the clearance and settlement
process.325 Market participants have stated that manual processing and a lack of automation
result in processing errors.326 Although some of these errors may be resolved within the
settlement cycle and not result in a failed trade, those that are not may result in failed trades,
which appear in the failure to deliver data.327 Further, market participants may incorporate the
likelihood that processing errors result in delays in payments or deliveries into securities
prices.328
 325 See, e.g., Omgeo Study, supra note 155, at 12; see also T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 26.
326 Matthew Stauffer, Managing Director, Head of Institutional Trade Processing at DTCC,
stated, “The findings of our survey highlight the benefits of leveraging automated post-trade
solutions to reduce the costs of operational functions and the risk inherent in manual processes.”

November 2021. The change in the U.S. settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2 became effective in
September 2017. Although processing errors are only one reason a trade may result in a fail to
deliver, there is no marked change in the fails data around the previous shortening of the
settlement cycle.

C. Analysis of Benefits, Costs, and Impact on Efficiency, Competition, and
Capital Formation
1. Benefits
The proposed amendment and new rules would likely yield benefits associated with the
reduction of risk in the settlement cycle. By shortening the settlement cycle, the proposed
amendment would reduce both the aggregate market value of all unsettled trades and the amount
of time that CCPs or the counterparties to a trade may be subject to market and credit risk from
173
an unsettled trade.329 First, holding transaction volumes constant, the market value of
transactions awaiting settlement at any given point in time under a T+1 settlement cycle will be
approximately one half lower than under the current T+2 settlement cycle. Using the risk
mitigation framework described in Part V.B.1, based on published statistics from the first quarter
of 2021330 and holding average dollar volumes constant, the aggregate notional value of
unsettled transactions at NSCC would fall from nearly $90 billion to approximately $45
billion.331
Second, a market participant that experiences counterparty default and enters into a new
transaction under a T+2 settlement cycle is exposed to more market risk than would be the case
under a T+1 settlement cycle. As a result, market participants that are exposed to market, credit,
and liquidity risks would be exposed to less risk under a T+1 settlement cycle. This reduction in
risk may also extend to mutual fund transactions conducted with broker-dealers that currently
settle on a T+2 basis.332 To the extent that these transactions currently give rise to counterparty
risk exposures between mutual funds and broker-dealers, these exposures may decrease as a
consequence of a shorter settlement cycle. In addition, a shorter standard settlement cycle would
reduce liquidity risks that could arise by allowing investors to obtain the proceeds of securities
transactions sooner. These risks affect all market participants, are difficult to diversify away,
 329 See supra Part III.A.2.
330 See supra note 307, at 14.
331 See id. at 20.
332 In today’s environment, ETFs and certain closed-end funds clear and settle on a T+2
basis. Open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds) generally settle on a T+1 basis, except for certain
retail funds which typically settle on T+2. Thus, the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)
would require ETFs, closed-end funds, and mutual funds settling on a T+2 basis to revise their
settlement timeframes.
174
and require resources to manage and mitigate.
CCPs require clearing members to post financial resources in order to secure members’
obligations to deliver cash and securities to the CCP. Clearing members in turn impose fees on
their customers, e.g., introducing broker-dealers, institutional investors, and retail investors. The
margin requirements required by the CCP are a function of the risk posed to the CCP by the
potential default of the clearing member. That risk is a function of several factors including the
value of trades submitted for clearing but not yet settled and the volatility of the securities prices
that make up those unsettled trades. As these factors are an increasing function of the time to
settlement, by reducing settlement from T+2 to T+1, a CCP may require less collateral from its
members, and the CCP’s members may, in turn, reduce fees that they may pass down to other
market participants, including introducing broker-dealers, institutional investors, and retail
investors.
Any reduction in clearing broker-dealers’ required margin would provide multiple
benefits. First, financial resources that are used to mitigate the risks of the clearance and
settlement process can be put to alternative uses. Reducing the financial risks associated with the
overall clearance and settlement process would reduce the amount of collateral required to
mitigate these risks, which would reduce the costs that market participants bear to manage and
mitigate these risks and the allocative inefficiencies that may stem from risk management
practices.333 Second, assets that are valuable because they are particularly suited to meeting
financial resource obligations may be better allocated to market participants that hold these
assets for their fundamental risk and return characteristics. This improvement in allocative
 333 See supra Part V.B (further discussing financial resources collected to mitigate and
manage financial risks).
175
efficiency may improve capital formation.
A portion of the savings from less costly risk management under a T+1 standard
settlement cycle relative to a T+2 standard settlement cycle may flow through to investors.
Investors may be able to profitably redeploy financial resources that were once needed to fund
higher clearing fees, for example.
Market participants might also individually benefit through reduced clearing fund deposit
requirements. In 2012, the BCG Study estimated that cost reductions related to reduced clearing
fund contributions resulting from moving from a T+3 to a T+2 settlement cycle would amount to
$25 million per year.334 In addition, a shorter settlement cycle might reduce liquidity risk by
allowing investors to obtain the proceeds of their securities transactions sooner. Reduced
liquidity risk may be a benefit to individual investors, but it may also reduce the volatility of
securities markets by reducing liquidity demands in times of adverse market conditions,
potentially reducing the correlation between market prices and the risk management practices of
market participants.335
 334 See BCG Study, supra note 22, at 10. According to SIFMA, average daily trading
volume in U.S. equities grew from $253.1B in 2011 to $564.7B in 2021, an increase of 123%.
See CBOE Exchange, Inc., and SIFMA, US Equities and Related Statistics (Jan. 3, 2022),
https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-equity-and-related-securities-statistics/us-equitiesand-related-statistics-sifma/. Price volatility, as measured by the standard deviation of the price,
is concave in time, which means that as a period of time increases, volatility will increase, but at
a decreasing rate. This suggests that the reduction in price volatility from moving from T+2
settlement to T+1 settlement is larger than the reduction in price volatility from moving from
T+3 settlement to T+2 settlement. These two facts suggest that the estimated reduction in
clearing fund contributions would be more than $25 million per year.
335 See Peter F. Christoffersen & Francis X. Diebold, How Relevant is Volatility Forecasting
for Financial Risk Management?, 82 Rev. Econ. & Stat. 12 (2000),

176
Shortening the settlement cycle may reduce incentives for investors to trade excessively
in times of high volatility.336 Such incentives exist because investors do not always bear the full
cost of settlement risk for their trades. Broker-dealers incur costs in managing settlement risk
with CCPs. Broker-dealers can recover the average cost of risk management from their
customers. However, if a particular trade has above-average settlement risk, such as when
market prices are unusually volatile, it is difficult for broker-dealers to pass along these higher
costs to their customers because fees typically depend on factors other than those such as market
volatility that impact settlement risk. In extreme cases broker-dealers may prevent a customer
from trading.
337 Shortening the settlement cycle reduces the cost of risk management and should
reduce any such incentives to trade more than they otherwise would if they bore the full cost of
settlement risk for their trades.
The benefits of harmonized settlement cycles may also accrue to mutual funds. As
described above,338 transactions in mutual fund shares typically settle on a T+1 basis even when
transactions in their portfolio securities settle on a T+2 basis. As a result, there is a one-day
mismatch between when these funds make payments to shareholders that redeem shares and
when they receive cash proceeds for portfolio securities they sell. This mismatch represents a

shows that volatility can be predicted in the short run, and concludes that short run forecastable
volatility would be useful for risk management practices.

177
source of liquidity risk for mutual funds. Shortening the settlement cycle by one day will
mitigate the liquidity risk due to this mismatch. As a result, mutual funds that settle on a T+1
basis may be able to reduce the size of cash reserves or the size of back up credit facilities that
some currently use to manage liquidity risk from the mismatch in settlement cycles. Further,
mutual funds may be able to invest incoming cash more quickly when funds have net
subscriptions, because the settlement time for the purchase of fund shares will be aligned with
the settlement time for portfolio investments, thus allowing funds to maximize their exposure to
their defined investment strategies.
The Commission preliminarily believes that these benefits are unlikely to be substantially
mitigated by the exceptions to Rule 15c6-1(a) discussed in Part III.A. Market participants that
rely on Rule 15c6-1(b) in order to transact in limited partnership interests that are not listed on an
exchange or for which quotations are not disseminated through an automated quotation system of
a registered securities association would likely continue to rely on the exception if the
Commission adopts the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). There may be transactions
covered by Rule 15c6-1(b) that in the past did not make use of this exception because they
settled within two business days, but that may require use of this exception under the proposed
amendment to paragraph (a) of the rule because they require more than one business day to
settle. However, these markets are opaque and the Commission does not have data on
transactions in these categories that currently settle within two days but that might make use of
this exception under the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). In addition, pursuant to Rule
15c6-1(b), the Commission has granted an exemption from Rule 15c6-1 for securities that do not
have facilities for transfer or delivery in the U.S.
339 Market participants relying on this
 339 See supra note 90 and accompanying text.
178
exemption are unlikely to be impacted by a shortening of the standard settlement cycle to T+1.
Finally, the extent to which different types of market participants would experience any
benefits that stem from the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may depend on their market
power. As discussed above,340 the clearance and settlement system involves a number of
intermediaries that provide a range of services between the ultimate buyer and seller of a
security. Those market participants that have a greater ability to negotiate with customers or
service providers may be able to retain a larger portion of the operational cost savings from a
shorter settlement cycle than others, as they may be able to use their market power to avoid
passing along the cost savings to their clients.
The Commission also proposes to delete Rule15c6-1(c) that establishes a T+4 settlement
cycle for firm commitment offerings for securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. ET, unless
otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.341 As discussed
above, paragraph (c) is rarely used in the current T+2 settlement environment, but the IWG
expects a T+1 standard settlement cycle would increase reliance on paragraph (c).342 The
Commission preliminarily believes that establishing T+1 as the standard settlement cycle for
these firm commitment offerings, and thereby aligning the settlement cycle with the standard
settlement cycle for securities generally, would reduce exposures of underwriters, dealers, and
investors to credit and market risk, and better ensure that the primary issuance of securities is
available to settle secondary market trading in such securities. The Commission believes that
harmonizing the settlement cycle for such firm commitment offerings with secondary market
 340 See supra Part II.B.
341 See supra Part III.A.3.
342 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 33–35.
179
trading, to the greatest extent possible, limits the potential for operational risk. Further, should
there be a need to settle beyond T+1, perhaps because of complex documentation requirements
of certain types of offerings, the parties to the transaction can agree to a longer settlement period
pursuant to paragraph (d) when they enter the transaction.
In addition to the amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) and proposed deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c),
the Commission proposes three additional rules applicable, respectively, to broker-dealers,
investment advisers, and CMSPs to improve the efficiency of managing the processing of
institutional trades under the shortened timeframes that would be available in a T+1
environment. First, the Commission proposes new Rule 15c6-2 to require that a broker-dealer
enter into contracts with institutional customers that can achieve the allocation, confirmation, and
affirmation of a securities transaction no later than the end of trade date.343
The Commission preliminarily believes that implementing a T+1 standard settlement
cycle, as well as any potential further shortening beyond T+1, will necessitate significant
increases in same-day affirmation rates because timely affirmations will be critical to achieving
timely settlement. In this way, the Commission also preliminarily believes that proposed Rule
15c6-2 should facilitate timely settlement as a general matter because it will accelerate the
transmission and affirmation of trade data to trade date, improving the accuracy and efficiency of
institutional trade processing and reducing the potential for settlement failures. The Commission
further anticipates that proposed Rule 15c6-2 would likely encourage further development of
automated and standardized practices among market participants more generally, particularly
those that continue to rely on manual processes to achieve settlement.
 343 See supra Part III.B.1.
180
Although same-day affirmation is considered a best practice for institutional trade
processing, adoption is not universal across market participants or even across all trades entered
by a given participant. Market participants continue to use hundreds of “local” matching
platforms, and rely on inconsistent SSI data independently maintained by broker-dealers,
investment managers, custodians, sub-custodians, and agents on separate databases. As
discussed in Part II.B, processing institutional trades requires managing the back and forth
involved with transmitting and reconciling trade information among the parties, functionally
matching and re-matching with the counterparties to the trade, as well as custodians and agents,
to facilitate settlement. It also requires market participants to engage in allocation processes,
such as allocation-level cancellations and corrections, some of which are still processed
manually.
344 This collection of redundant, often manual steps and the use of uncoordinated (i.e.,
not standardized) databases can lead to delays, exceptions processing, settlement fails, wasted
resources, and economic losses. The total industry headcount employed in managing today’s
pre-settlement and settlement fails management process is in the thousands, and additional costs
and risks resulting from the inability to settle efficiently are significant.345 The Commission
believes that proposed Rule 15c6-2 should increase the percentage of trades that achieve an
affirmed confirmation on trade date and should help facilitate an orderly transition to T+1.
Proposed Rule 15c6-2 would also improve the efficiency of the settlement cycle by incentivizing
market participants to commit to operational and technological upgrades that facilitate same-day
affirmation to eliminate, among other things, manual operations, while also reducing operational
risk and promoting readiness for shortening the settlement cycle.
 344 See supra note 168.
345 See DTCC Modernizing Paper, supra note 59.
181
Second, the Commission proposes to amend the recordkeeping obligations of investment
advisers to ensure that they are properly documenting their related allocations and affirmations,
as well as the confirmations they receive from their broker-dealers.346 The proposed amendment
to Rule 204-2 would require advisers to time and date stamp records of any allocation and each
affirmation. The Commission believes that the timing of communicating allocations to the
broker or dealer is a critical pre-requisite to ensure that confirmations can be issued in a timely
manner, and affirmation is the final step necessary for an adviser to acknowledge agreement on
the terms of the trade or alert the broker or dealer of a discrepancy. The Commission believes
the proposed recordkeeping requirements would help advisers to establish that they have met
their obligations to achieve a matched trade.
Finally, the Commission proposes a requirement for CMSPs to establish, implement,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures designed to facilitate straight-through
processing.347 Under the rule, a CMSP facilitates straight-through processing when its policies
and procedures enable its users to minimize, to the greatest extent that is technologically
practicable, the need for manual input of trade details or manual intervention to resolve errors
and exceptions that can prevent settlement of the trade.348
The Commission believes that increasing the efficiency of using a CMSP can reduce
costs and risks associated with processing institutional trades and improve the efficiency of the
 346 See supra Part III.C.
347 See supra Part III.D; see also supra Part III.D.1 (further discussing the term “straightthrough processing”).
348 See supra note 347.
182
National C&S System. CMSPs have become increasingly connected to a wide variety of market
participants in the U.S.,349 increasing the need to reduce risks and inefficiencies that may result
from use of a CMSPs’ systems. Because the proposed rule would preclude reliance on service
offerings at CMSPs that rely on manual processing, the Commission preliminarily believes the
proposed rule will better position CMSPs to provide services that not only reduce risk generally
but also help facilitate an orderly transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle, as well as
potential further shortening of the settlement cycle in the future. The proposed requirement
would support the benefits derived from a shortening of the settlement cycle and would mitigate
any subsequent potential increase in fails due to the reduced time to remediate any errors in
trades.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 also would require a CMSP to submit every twelve months to
the Commission a report that describes the following: (i) the CMSP’s current policies and
procedures for facilitating straight-through processing; (ii) its progress in facilitating straightthrough processing during the twelve month period covered by the report; and (iii) the steps the
CMSP intends to take to facilitate and promote straight-through processing during the twelve
month period that follows the period covered by the report.350 The proposed requirement would
also inform the Commission and the public, particularly the direct and indirect users of the
CMSP, as to the progress being made each year to advance implementation of straight-through
processing with respect to the allocation, confirmation, affirmation, and matching of institutional
trades, the communication of messages among the parties to the transactions, and the availability
of service offerings that reduce or eliminate the need for manual processing.
 349 See supra note 185.
350 See supra Part III.D.2.
183
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would require the CMSP to file the report on EDGAR using
Inline XBRL, a structured (machine-readable) data language. Requiring a centralized filing
location and a machine-readable data language for the reports would facilitate access, retrieval,
analysis, and comparison of the disclosed straight-through processing information across
different CMSPs and time periods by the Commission and the public, thus potentially
augmenting the informational benefits of the report requirement.
2. Costs
The Commission preliminarily believes that compliance with a T+1 standard settlement
cycle would involve initial fixed costs to update systems and processes.351 The Commission
does not have all of the data necessary to form its own firm-level estimates of the costs of
updates to systems and processes, as the types of data needed to form these estimates are difficult
or impossible for the Commission to collect. However, the Commission has used inputs
provided by industry studies discussed in this release to quantify these costs to the extent
possible in Part V.C.5. In addition, the Commission encourages commenters to provide any
information or data on the costs to market participants of the proposed rule.
The operational cost burdens associated with the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)
for different market participants might vary depending on each market participant’s degree of
direct or indirect inter-connectivity to the clearance and settlement process, regardless of size.
For example, market participants that internally manage more of their own post-trade processes
 351 Industry sources have suggested some updates to systems and processes might yield
operational cost savings after the initial update. E.g., “While there may be … up-front
implementation costs to transition the industry to T+1, the industry foresees long-term cost
reduction for market participants, and by extension, costs borne by end investors, given the
benefits of moving to T+1 settlement.” T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 9; see infra Part V.C.5.a)
for industry estimates ofthe costs and benefits of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a).
184
would directly incur more of the upfront operational costs associated with the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), because they would be required to directly undertake more of the
upgrades and testing necessary for a T+1 standard settlement cycle. As mentioned in Part II.B,
other market participants might outsource the clearance and settlement of their transactions to
third-party providers of back-office services. The exposures to the operational costs associated
with shortening the standard settlement cycle would be indirect to the extent that third-party
service providers pass through the costs of infrastructure upgrades to their customers. The
degree to which customers bear operational costs depends on their bargaining position relative to
third-party providers. Large customers with market power may be able to avoid internalizing
these costs, while small customers in a weaker negotiation position relative to service providers
may bear the bulk of these costs.
Further, changes to initial and ongoing operational costs may make some self-clearing
market participants alter their decision to continue internally managing the clearance and
settlement of their transactions. Entities that currently internally manage their clearance and
settlement activity may prefer to restructure their businesses to rely instead on third-party
providers of clearance and settlement services that may be able to amortize the initial fixed cost
of upgrade across a much larger volume of transaction activity.
In addition, the shortening of the settlement cycle may increase the need for some market
participants engaging in cross-border and cross-asset transactions to hedge risks stemming from
mismatched settlement cycles, resulting in additional costs. For example, under the proposed
T+1 settlement cycle, a market participant selling a security in European equity markets to fund a
purchase of securities in U.S. markets would face a one day lag between settlement in Europe
and settlement in the U.S. The market participant could choose between bearing an additional

day of market risk in the U.S. trading markets by delaying the purchase by a day, or funding the
purchase of U.S. shares with short-term borrowing. Additionally, because the FX market has a
T+2 settlement cycle,352 the market participant would also be faced with a choice between
bearing an additional day of currency risk due to the need to sell Euros as part of the transaction,
or to incur the cost related to hedging away this risk in the forward or futures market.
The way that different market participants would likely bear costs as a result of the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may also vary based on their business structure. For
example, a shorter standard settlement cycle will require payment for securities that settle
regular-way by T+1 rather than T+2. Generally, regardless of current funding arrangements
between investors and broker-dealers, removing one business day between execution and
settlement would mean that broker-dealers could choose between requiring investors to fund the
purchase of securities one business day earlier while extending the same level of credit they do
under T+2 settlement, or providing an additional business day of funding to investors. In other
words, broker-dealers could pass through some of the costs of a shorter standard settlement cycle
by imposing the same shorter cycle on investors, or they could pass these costs on to investors by
raising transactions fees to compensate for the additional business day of funding the brokerdealer may choose to provide. The extent to which these costs get passed through to customers
may depend on, among other things, the market power of the broker-dealer. If a broker-dealer
 352 See, e.g., CME Rulebook, Ch. 13, § 1302 (“ʻSpot FX Transaction’” means a currency
purchase and sale that is bilaterally settled by the counterparties via an actual delivery of the
relevant currencies within two Business Days.”), https://www.cmegroup.com/rulebook/CME/.
U.S. and Canadian dollar spot FX transactions settle on the next business day. Id. Ch. 13,
Appendix.
186
does not face significant competition, its market power may enable it to recover the entire initial
investment cost from its customers. On the other hand, a broker-dealer that faces perfect
competition for its customers may be unable to pass along any of these costs to its customers.353
However, broker-dealers that predominantly serve retail investors may experience the
burden of an earlier payment requirement differently from broker-dealers with more institutional
clients or large custodian banks because of the way retail investors fund their accounts. Retail
investors may find it difficult to accelerate payments associated with their transactions, which
may cause broker-dealers who are unwilling to extend additional credit to retail investors to
instead require that these investors pre-fund their transactions.354 These broker-dealers may also
experience costs unrelated to funding choices. For instance, retail investors may require
additional or different services such as education regarding the impact of the shorter standard
settlement cycle.
Finally, a shorter settlement cycle may result in higher costs associated with liquidating a
defaulting member’s position, as a shorter horizon may result in larger price impacts, particularly
for less liquid assets. For example, when a clearing member defaults, NSCC is obligated to
fulfill its trade guarantee with the defaulting member’s counterparty. One way it accomplishes
this is by liquidating assets from clearing fund contributions from clearing members. However,
liquidating assets in shorter periods of time can have larger adverse impacts on the prices of the
assets. Shortening the standard settlement cycle from two business days to one business day
 353 See supra Part V.C.1 for additional discussion regarding the impact of broker-dealer
market power. See infra Part V.C.5.b)(3) for quantitative estimates of the costs to brokerdealers.
354 See infra Part V.C.5.b)(3) for additional discussion regarding retail investors and their
broker-dealers.
187
could reduce the amount of time that NSCC would have to liquidate its assets, which may
exacerbate the price impact of liquidation.
3. Economic Implications through Other Commission Rules
As noted in Part III.E, the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), by shortening the
standard settlement cycle, could have an ancillary impact on the means by which market
participants comply with existing regulatory obligations that relate to the settlement timeframe.
The Commission also provided illustrative examples of specific Commission rules that include
such requirements or are otherwise are keyed-off settlement date, including Regulation SHO,355
and certain provisions included in the Commission’s financial responsibility rules.356,357
Financial markets and regulatory requirements have evolved significantly since the
Commission adopted Rule 15c6-1 in 1993. Market participants have responded to these
developments in diverse ways, including implementing a variety of systems and processes, some
of which may be unique to specific market participants and their businesses, and some of which
may be integrated throughout business operations of certain market participants. Because of the
broad variety of ways in which market participants currently satisfy regulatory obligations
pursuant to Commission rules, in most circumstances it is difficult to identify those practices that
market participants would need to change in order to meet these other obligations. Under these
 355 17 CFR 242.200 et seq.
356 See supra Part III.E.2.
357 The Commission is also soliciting comment on the impact of shortening the settlement
cycle on compliance with Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act and broker-dealer obligations
with regard to prospectus delivery. See supra Parts III.E.3 and III.E.4. However, based on
current practices and comments received by the Commission to the T+2 proposing release, the
Commission preliminarily believes shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 will not impact
compliance with these rules. Id.
188
circumstances, and without additional information, the Commission is unable to provide an
estimate of the ancillary economic impact that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would
have on how market participants comply with other Commission rules. The Commission invites
commenters to provide quantitative and qualitative information about these potential economic
effects.
In certain cases, based on information about current market practices, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would be unlikely to
change the means by which market participants comply with existing regulatory requirements.
In these cases, the Commission believes that market participants would not incur significant
increased costs of compliance from such regulatory requirements from shortening the settlement
cycle to T+1.
In other cases, however, the proposed amendment may incrementally increase the costs
associated with complying with other Commission rules where such rules potentially require
broker-dealers to engage in purchases of securities. Two examples of these types of rules are
Regulation SHO and the Commission’s financial responsibility rules. In most instances,
Regulation SHO governs the timeframe in which a “participant” of a registered clearing agency
must close out a fail to deliver position by purchasing or borrowing securities.358 Similarly,
some of the Commission’s financial responsibility rules relate to actions or notifications that
reference the settlement date of a transaction. For example, Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3(m)359
 358 See supra Part III.E.1.
359 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(m).
189
uses the settlement date to prescribe the timeframe in which a broker-dealer must complete
certain sell orders on behalf of customers. As noted above, the term “settlement date” is also
incorporated into paragraph (c)(9) of Rule 15c3-1,360 which explains what it means to “promptly
transmit” funds and “promptly deliver” securities within the meaning of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and
(a)(2)(v) of Rule 15c3-1. As explained above, the concepts of promptly transmitting funds and
promptly delivering securities are incorporated in other provisions of the financial responsibility
rules.361 Under the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the timeframes included in these
rules will be one business day closer to the trade date.
The Commission preliminarily believes that shortening these timeframes would not
materially affect the costs that broker-dealers would likely incur to meet their Regulation SHO
obligations and obligations under the Commission’s financial responsibility rules. Nevertheless,
the Commission acknowledges that a shorter settlement cycle could affect the processes by
which broker-dealers manage the likelihood of incurring these obligations. For example, brokerdealers may currently have in place inventory management systems that help them avoid failing
to deliver securities by T+2. Broker-dealers would likely incur costs in order to update these
systems to support a shorter settlement cycle.
In cases where market participants will need to adjust the way in which they comply with
other Commission rules, the magnitude of the costs associated with these adjustments is difficult
to quantify. As noted above, market participants employ a wide variety of strategies to meet
 360 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(9).
361 See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(v); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(1)(iii), (k)(2)(i),
(k)(2)(ii); 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(1)(A); 17 CFR 240.17a-13(a)(3).
190
regulatory obligations. For example, broker-dealers may ensure that they have securities
available to meet their obligations by using inventory management systems or they may choose
instead to borrow securities. An estimate of costs is further complicated by the possibility that
market participants could change their compliance strategies in response to a shorter standard
settlement cycle.
As with the T+2 transition, the Commission anticipates that the proposed transition to
T+1 would again require changes to SRO rules and changes to the operations or market
participants subject to those rules to achieve consistency with a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
Certain SRO rules reference existing Rule 15c6-1 or currently define “regular way” settlement as
occurring on T+2 and, as such, may need to be amended in connection with shortening the
standard settlement cycle to T+1. Certain timeframes or deadlines in SRO rules also may refer
to the settlement date, either expressly or indirectly. In such cases, the SROs may need to amend
these rules in connection with shortening the settlement cycle to T+1.362
The Commission invites commenters to provide quantitative and qualitative information
about the impact of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) on the costs associated with
compliance with other Commission rules.
4. Effect on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
Market participants may incur initial costs for the investments necessary to comply with a
shorter standard settlement cycle.363 However, these costs would likely differ across market
participants and these differences may exacerbate coordination problems. First, per-transaction
 362 The T+1 Report similarly indicates that SROs will likely need to update their rules to
facilitate a transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle. T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 35.
363 See supra Part V.C.2.
191
operational costs clearing members incur in connection with the clearing services they provide
may be higher for members that clear fewer transactions than such costs are for members that
clear a higher volume of transactions. Thus, the extent to which many of the upgrades necessary
for a T+1 standard settlement cycle are optimal for a member to adopt unilaterally may depend,
in part, on the transaction volume cleared by such member. For example, certain upgrades
necessary for a T+1 standard settlement cycle may result in economies of scale, where large
clearing members are able to comply with the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) at a lower
per-transaction cost than smaller members. As a result, larger members might take a short time
to recover their initial costs for upgrades; smaller members with lower transaction volumes
might take longer to recover their initial cost outlays and might be more reluctant to make the
upgrades in the absence of the proposed amendment. These differences in cost per transaction
may be mitigated through the use of third-party service providers.
In addition, the Commission acknowledges that the upgrades necessary to implement a
shorter standard settlement cycle may produce indirect economic effects. We analyze some of
these indirect effects, such as the impact on competition and third-party service providers, in the
following section.
A shorter settlement cycle might improve the efficiency of the clearance and settlement
process through several channels. First, the Commission preliminarily believes that the primary
effect that a shorter settlement cycle would have on the efficiency of the settlement process
would be a reduction in the credit, market, and liquidity risks that broker-dealers, CCPs, and
other market participants are subject to during the standard settlement cycle.364 A shorter
 364 Reduction of these risks should result in the reduction of margin requirements and other
risk management activity that requires resources that could be put to another use.
192
standard settlement cycle will generally reduce the volume of unsettled transactions that could
potentially pose settlement risk to counterparties. Shortening the period between trade execution
and settlement would enable trades to be settled with less aggregate risk to counterparties or the
CCP. A shorter standard settlement cycle may also decrease liquidity risk by enabling market
participants to access the proceeds of their transactions sooner, which may reduce the cost
market participants incur to handle idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (i.e., liquidity shocks that are
uncorrelated with the market). That is, because the time interval between a purchase/sale of
securities and payment is reduced by one business day, market participants with immediate
payment obligations that they could cover by selling securities would be required to obtain shortterm funding for one less day.365 As a result of reduced cost associated with covering their
liquidity needs, market participants may, under particular circumstances, be able to shift assets
that would otherwise be held as liquid collateral towards more productive uses, improving
allocative efficiency.366
Second, a shorter standard settlement cycle may increase price efficiency through its
effect on credit risk exposures between financial intermediaries and their customers. In
particular, a prior study noted that certain intermediaries that transact on behalf of investors, such
as broker-dealers, may be exposed to the risk that their customers default on payment obligations
when the price of purchased securities declines during the settlement cycle.367 As a result of the
 365 See supra Part V.B.2.
366 See supra Part V.A.
367 See Madhavan et al., supra note 296.
193
option to default on payment obligations, customers’ payoffs from securities purchases resemble
European call options and, from a theoretical standpoint, can be valued as such. Notably, the
value of European call options increases in the time to expiration368 suggesting that the value of
call options held by customers who purchase securities is increasing in the length of the
settlement cycle. In order to compensate itself for the call option that it writes, an intermediary
may include the cost of these call options as part of its transaction fee and this cost may become
a component of bid-ask spreads for securities transactions. By reducing the value of customers’
option to default by reducing the option’s time to maturity, a shorter standard settlement cycle
may reduce transaction costs in U.S. securities markets. In addition, to the extent that any
benefit buyers receive from deferring payment during the settlement cycle is incorporated in
securities returns,369 the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may reduce the extent to which
such returns deviate from returns consistent with changes in fundamentals.
As discussed in more detail above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would likely require market participants to incur costs
related to infrastructure upgrades and would likely yield benefits to market participants, largely
in the form of reduced financial risks related to settlement. As a result, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) could affect competition
in a number of different, and potentially offsetting, ways.
The prospective reduction in financial risks related to shortening the standard settlement
 368 All other things equal, an option with a longer time to maturity is more likely to be in the
money given that the variance of the underlying security’s price at the exercise date is higher.
369 See supra Part V.B.2.
194
cycle may represent a reduction in barriers to entry for certain market participants.370 Reductions
in the financial resources required to cover an NSCC member’s clearing fund requirements that
result from a shorter standard settlement cycle could encourage financial firms that currently
clear transactions through NSCC clearing members to become clearing members themselves.
Their entry into the market could promote competition among NSCC clearing members.
Furthermore, if a reduction in settlement risks results in lower transaction costs for the reasons
discussed above, market participants that were, on the margin, discouraged from supplying
liquidity to securities markets due to these costs could choose to enter the market for liquidity
suppliers, increasing competition.
At the same time, the Commission acknowledges that the process improvements required
to enable a shorter standard settlement cycle could adversely affect competition. Among
clearing members, where such process improvements might be necessary to comply with the
shorter standard settlement cycle required under the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the
cost associated with compliance might increase barriers to entry, because new firms would incur
higher fixed costs associated with a shorter standard settlement cycle if they wish to enter the
market. Clearing members might choose to comply by upgrading their systems and processes or
may choose instead to exit the market for clearing services. The exit of clearing members could
have negative consequences for competition among clearing members. Clearing activity tends to
be concentrated among larger broker-dealers.371 Clearing member exit could result in further
concentration and additional market power for those clearing members that remain.
 370 See supra Part V.C.1 for a discussion of the reduction in credit, market, and liquidity
risks to which NSCC would be subject as a result of a shortening of the settlement cycle and the
subsequent reduction financial resources dedicated to mitigating those risks.
371 See supra Part V.B.2.
195
Alternatively, some current clearing members may choose to comply in part by
outsourcing their operational needs to third-party service providers. Use of third-party service
providers may represent a reasonable response to the operational costs associated with the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). To the extent that third-party service providers are able
to spread the fixed costs of compliance across a larger volume of transactions than their clients,
the Commission preliminarily believes that the use of third-party service providers might impose
a smaller compliance cost on clearing members than if these firms directly bore the costs of
compliance. The Commission preliminarily believes that this impact may stretch beyond just
clearing members. The use of third-party service providers may mitigate the extent to which the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) raises barriers to entry for broker-dealers. Because these
barriers to entry may have adverse effects on competition between clearing members, we
preliminarily believe that the use of third-party service providers may mitigate the adverse
effects of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) on competition between broker-dealers.
Existing market power may also affect the distribution of competitive impacts stemming
from the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) across different types of market participants.
While, as noted above, reductions in the credit, market, and liquidity risks that broker-dealers,
CCPs, and other market participants are subject to during the standard settlement cycle could
promote competition among clearing members and liquidity suppliers, these groups may benefit
to differing degrees, depending on the extent to which they are able to capture the benefits of a
shortened standard settlement cycle.
Finally, a shorter standard settlement cycle might also improve the capital efficiency of
the clearance and settlement process, which would promote capital formation in U.S. securities
196
markets and in the financial system generally.372 A shorter standard settlement cycle would
reduce the amount of time that collateral must be held for a given trade, thus freeing the
collateral to be used elsewhere earlier. For a given quantity of trading activity, collateral would
also be committed to clearing fund deposits for a shorter period of time. The greater collateral
efficiency promoted by a shorter settlement cycle might also indirectly promote capital formation
for market participants in the financial system in general. Specifically, the improved capital
efficiency that would result from a shorter standard settlement cycle would enable a given
amount of collateral to support a larger amount of financial activity.
5. Quantification of Direct and Indirect Effects of a T+1 Settlement
Cycle
In previous years, several industry groups have released estimates for compliance costs
associated with a shorter standard settlement cycle, including the SIA, the ISC, and BCG.373
Although all of these studies examined prior shortenings of the settlement cycle including from
T+5 to T+3 and from T+3 to T+2, in the absence of a current study examining shortening from
the current T+2 to T+1 they serve as a useful rough initial estimate of the costs involved in a
settlement cycle shortening. The most recent of these, the BCG Study performed a cost-benefit
analysis of a T+2 standard settlement cycle. Below is a summary of the cost estimates in the
BCG Study and in the following subsections, an evaluation of these estimates as part of the
discussion of the potential direct and indirect compliance costs related to the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). In addition, the Commission encourages commenters to provide
additional information to help quantify the economic effects that we are currently unable to
 372 See supra Part V.A for more discussion regarding capital formation and efficiency.

BCG Study, supra note 22. The SIA has since merged with other groups to form SIFMA.
197
quantify due to data limitations.
a) Industry Estimates of Costs and Benefits
The BCG Study concluded that the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle would cost
approximately $550 million in incremental initial investments across industry constituent
groups,374 which would result in annual operating savings of $170 million and $25 million in
annual return on reinvested capital from clearing fund reductions.375
The BCG Study also estimated that the average level of required investments per firm
could range from $1 to 5 million, with large institutional broker-dealers incurring the largest
amount of investments on a per-firm basis, and buy side firms at the lower end of the
spectrum.376 The investment costs for “other” entities, including DTCC, DTCC ITP Matching
(US) LLC (f/k/a Omgeo Matching (US) LLC), service bureaus, RICs and non-self-clearing
broker-dealers totaled $70 million for the entire group. Within this $70 million, DTCC and
Omgeo were estimated to have a compliance investment cost of $10 million each. The study’s
authors estimated that institutional broker-dealers would have operational cost savings of
approximately 5%, retail broker-dealers of 2% to 4%, buy-side firms of 2% and custodial banks
of 10% to 15% for an industry total operational cost savings of approximately $170MM per
 374 The BCG Study generally refers to “institutional broker-dealers,” “retail broker-dealers,”
“buy side” firms, and “custodian banks,” without defining these particular groups. The
Commission uses these terms when referring to estimates provided by the BCG Study but notes
that its own definitions of various affected parties may differ from those in the BCG Study.
375 See BCG Study, supra note 22, at 9–10.
376 Id. at 30–31.
198
year.
377
The BCG Study also estimated the annual clearing fund reductions resulting from
reductions in clearing firms’ clearing funds requirements to be $25 million per year.378 The
study estimated this by considering the reduction in clearing fund requirements and multiplied it
by the average Federal Funds target rate for the 10-year period up until 2008 (3.5%). The BCG
Study also estimated the value of the risk reduction in buy side exposure to the sell side. The
implied savings were estimated to be $200 million per year, but these values were not included
in the overall cost-benefit calculations.
Several factors limit the usefulness of the BCG Study’s estimates of potential costs and
benefits of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). First, a further shortening of the
settlement cycle to T+1 may require investments in new technology and processes that were not
necessary under the previous shortening to T+2. Second, technological improvements, such as
the increased use of computers and automation in post-trade processes, that have been made
since 2012, when the report was first published, may have reduced the cost of the upgrades
necessary to comply with a shorter settlement cycle. This may, in turn, reduce the costs
associated with the proposed amendment,379 as a larger portion of market participants may have
already adopted many processes that would reduce the cost of a transition to a shorter settlement
cycle. In addition, the BCG Study considered as a part of its cost estimates operational cost
 377 See id. at 41.
378 See supra note 334 for a discussion of the impact of increases in daily trading volume
since the time of the BCG study on this estimate.
379 See supra Part V.A. While market participants may have already made investments
consistent with implementing a shorter settlement cycle, the fact that these investments have not
resulted in a shorter settlement cycle is consistent with the existence of coordination problems
among market participants.
199
savings as a result of improvements to operational efficiency.
Lastly, the BCG Study was premised on survey responses by a subset of market
participants that may be affected by the rule. Surveys were sent to 270 market participants and
70 responses were received, including 20 institutional broker-dealers, prime brokers and
correspondent clearers; 12 retail broker-dealers; 17 buy side firms; 14 RIAs; and seven custodian
banks. Given the low response rate, as well as the uncertainty regarding the sample of market
participants that was asked to complete the survey, the Commission cannot conclude that the cost
estimates in the BCG Study are representative of the costs of all market participants.380
b) Estimates of Costs
The proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would generate direct and indirect costs for
market participants, who may need to modify and/or replace multiple systems and processes to
comply with a T+1 standard settlement cycle. As noted above, the T+2 Playbook included a
timeline with milestones and dependencies necessary for a transition to a T+2 settlement cycle,
as well as activities that market participants should consider in preparation for the transition and
the Commission preliminarily believes that this provides an initial guide to those that would be
necessary for a transition to T+1. The Commission preliminarily believes that the majority of
activities for migration to a T+1 settlement cycle would stem from behavior modification of
market participants and systems testing, and thus the majority of the costs of migration would be
from labor.381 These modifications would include a compression of the settlement timeline, as
well as an increase in the fees that brokers may impose on their customers for trade failures.
Although the T+2 Playbook did not include any direct estimates of the compliance costs for a
 380 See BCG Study, supra note 22, at 15.
381 See id.
200
T+2 settlement cycle, the Commission utilizes the timeline in the T+2 Playbook for specific
actions necessary to migrate to a T+2 settlement cycle to directly estimate the inputs needed for
migration, and form preliminary compliance cost estimates for the shortening to T+2 and uses
these as an estimate for the shortening to T+1.
In addition, the T+2 Playbook, the ISC White Paper, and the BCG Study identified
several categories of actions that market participants might need to take to comply with a T+2
settlement cycle and likely also with a T+1 settlement cycle – processing, asset servicing, and
documentation.382 While the following cost estimates for these remedial activities span industrywide requirements for a migration to a T+1 settlement cycle, the Commission does not anticipate
each market participant directly undertaking all of these activities for several reasons. First,
some market participants work with third-party service providers to facilitate certain functions
that may be impacted by a shorter standard settlement cycle, such as trade processing and asset
servicing, and thus may only bear the costs of the requirements through fees paid to those service
providers. Second, certain costs might only fall on specific categories of entities. For example,
the costs of updating the CNS and ID Net system would only directly fall on NSCC, DTC, and
members/participants of those clearing agencies. Finally, some market participants may already
have the processes and systems in place to accommodate a T+1 standard settlement cycle or
would be able to adjust to a T+1 settlement cycle without incurring significant costs. For
example, some market participants may already have the systems and processes in place to meet
the requirements for same-day trade affirmation and matching consistent with the requirements
 382 See T+2 Playbook, supra note 27, at 11.
201
in proposed Rule 15c6-2.383 These market participants may thus bear a significantly lower cost
to update their trade affirmation systems/processes to settle on a T+1 standard settlement
cycle.384
The following section examines several categories of market participants and estimate the
compliance costs for each category. The Commission’s estimate of the number and type of
personnel that may be required is based on the scope of activities for a given category of market
participant necessary for the market participant to migrate to a T+1 settlement cycle, the market
participant’s role within the clearance and settlement process, and the amount of testing required
to minimize undue disruptions.
385 Hourly salaries for personnel are from SIFMA’s Management
and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013.386 These estimates use the timeline
from the T+2 Playbook to determine the length of time personnel would work on the activities
necessary to support a T+1 settlement cycle. The timeline provides an indirect method to
 383 See BCG Study, supra note 22, at 23.
384 The BCG Study, as it is based on survey responses from market participants, does reflect
the heterogeneity of compliance costs for market participants.
385 For example, FMUs that play a critical role in the clearance and settlement infrastructure
would require more testing associated with a T+1 standard settlement cycle than institutional
investors.
386 To monetize the internal costs, the Commission staff used data from SIFMA publications,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800 hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35
(professionals) or 2.93 (office) to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and
overhead. See SIFMA, Management and Professional Earnings in the Security Industry – 2013
(Oct. 7, 2013), https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/management-and-professionalearnings-in-the-securities-industry-2013/; SIFMA, Office Salaries in the Securities Industry –
2013 (Oct. 7, 2013), https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/office-salaries-in-the-securitiesindustry/. These figures have been adjusted for inflation using data published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
202
estimate the inputs necessary to migrate to a T+1 settlement cycle, rather than relying directly on
survey response estimates. The Commission acknowledges many entities are already
undertaking activities to support a migration to a T+1 settlement cycle in anticipation of the
proposed amendment. However, to the extent that the costs of these activities have already been
incurred, the Commission considers these costs sunk, and they are not included in the analysis
below.
(1) FMUs – CCPs and CSDs
CNS, NSCC/DTC’s ID Net service, and other systems would require adjustment to
support a T+1 standard settlement cycle. According to the T+2 Playbook and the ISC White
Paper, regulation-dependent planning, implementation, testing, and migration activities
associated with the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle could last up to five quarters.387 The
Commission preliminarily believes that these activities would impose a one-time compliance
cost of $12.6 million388 for DTC and NSCC each. After this initial compliance cost, the
Commission preliminarily expects that both DTCC and NSCC would incur minimal ongoing
costs from the transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle, because the Commission believes
that the majority of costs would stem from pre-migration activities, such as implementation,
updates to systems and processes, and testing.
(2) Matching/ETC Providers – Exempt Clearing Agencies
Matching/ETC Providers may need to adapt their trade processing systems to comply
 387 See T+2 Playbook, supra note 27, at 11.
388 The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity, industry testing, and migration lasting five quarters. The
Commission assumes 10 operations specialists (at $149 per hour), 10 programmers (at $295 per
hour), and 1 senior operations manager (at $397/hour), working 40 hours per week. (10 × $149
+ 10 × $295 +1 × $397) × 5 × 13 × 40 = $12,575,000.
203
with a T+1 settlement cycle. This may include actions such as updating reference data,
configuring trade match systems, and configuring trade affirmation systems to affirm trades on
T+0. Matching/ETC Providers would also need to conduct testing and assess post- migration
activities. The Commission preliminarily estimates that these activities would impose a one-time
compliance cost of up to $12.6 million389 for each Matching/ ETC Provider. However, the
Commission acknowledges that some ETC providers may have a higher cost burden than others
based on the volume of transactions that they process. The Commission expects that ETC
providers would incur minimal ongoing costs after the initial transition to a T+1 settlement cycle
because the Commission preliminarily believes that the majority of the costs of migration to a
T+1 settlement cycle entail behavioral changes of market participants and pre-migration testing.
(3) Market Participants – Investors, Broker-Dealers,
Investment Advisers, and Bank Custodians
The overall compliance costs that a market participant incurs would depend on the extent
to which it is directly involved in functions related to clearance and settlement including trade
confirmation/affirmation, asset servicing, and other activities. For example, retail investors may
bear few (if any) direct costs in a transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle, because their
respective broker-dealer handles the back-office functions of each transaction. However, as is
discussed below, this does not imply that retail investors would not face indirect costs from the
 389 The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, matching, affirmation, testing, and postmigration testing lasting five quarters. The Commission assumes 10 operations specialists (at
$149 per hour), 10 programmers (at $295 per hour), and 1 senior operations manager (at
$397/hour), working 40hours per week. (10 × $149 + 10 × $295 + 1 × $397) × 5 × 13 × 40 =
$12,575,000.
204
transition, such as those passed through from broker-dealers or banks.
Institutional investors may need to configure systems and update reference data, which
may also include updates to trade funding and processing mechanisms, to operate in a T+1
environment. The Commission preliminarily estimates that this would require an initial
expenditure of $2.67 million per entity.390 However, these costs may vary depending on the
extent to which a particular institutional investor has already automated its processes. The
Commission preliminarily expects institutional investors would incur minimal ongoing direct
compliance costs after the initial transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
Broker-dealers that serve institutional investors would not only need to configure their
trading systems and update reference data, but may also need to update trade
confirmation/affirmation systems, documentation, cashiering and asset servicing functions,
depending on the roles they assume with respect to their clients. The Commission preliminarily
estimates that, on average, each of these broker-dealers would incur an initial compliance cost of
$5.44 million.391 The Commission preliminarily expects that these broker-dealers would incur
minimal ongoing direct compliance costs after the initial transition to a T+1 standard settlement
 390 The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, reference data, and testing activity to last
four quarters. We assume 2 operations specialists (at $149 per hour), 2 programmers (at $295
perhour), and 1 senior operations manager (at $397 per hour), working 40 hours per week. (2 ×
$149+ 2 × $195 + 1 × $397) × 4 × 13 × 40 = $2,673,400.
391 The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, reference data, documentation, asset
servicing, and testing to last four quarters. We assume 5 operations specialists (at $149 per
hour), 5 programmers (at $295 per hour), and 1 senior operations manager (at $397 per hour),
working 40 hours per week. (5 × $149 + 5 × $256 + 1 × $345) × 4 × 13 × 40 = $4,721,600.
205
cycle.
Broker-dealers that serve retail customers may also need to spend significant resources to
educate their clients about the shorter settlement cycle. The Commission preliminarily estimates
that these broker-dealers would incur an initial compliance cost of $9.91 million each.392
However, unlike previously mentioned market participants, the Commission expects that brokerdealers that serve retail investors may face significant one-time compliance costs after the initial
transition to T+1. Retail investors may require additional education and customer service, which
may impose costs on their broker-dealers. The Commission preliminarily believes that a
reasonable upper bound for the costs associated with this requirement is $30,000 per brokerdealer.393 Assuming all clearing and introducing broker-dealers must educate retail customers,
the upper bound for the costs of retail investor education would be approximately $40.6
million.394
Custodian banks would need to update their asset servicing functions to comply with a
 392 The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, reference data, documentation, asset
servicing, customer education and testing to last five quarters. We assume 5 operations
specialists (at $149 per hour), 5 programmers (at $295 per hour), 5 trainers (at $239 per hour)
and 1 senior operations manager (at $397 per hour), working 40 hours per week. (5 × $149 + 5 ×
$295 + 5 × $239 + 1 × $397) × 5 × 13 × 40 = $9,914,000.
393 This estimate is based on the assumption that a broker-dealer chooses to educate
customers using a 10-minute video that takes at most $3,000 per minute to produce. See
Crowdfunding, Exchange Act Release No. 76324 (Oct. 30, 2015), 80 FR 71388, 71529 & n.1683
(Nov. 16, 2015).
394 Calculated as $30,000 per broker-dealer × (156 broker-dealers reporting as self-clearing +
1,126 broker-dealers reporting as introducing but not self-clearing + 71 broker-dealers reporting
as introducing and self-clearing) = $40,590,000.
206
shorter settlement cycle. The Commission preliminarily estimates that custodian banks would
incur an initial compliance cost of $1.34 million,395 and expects custodian banks to incur
minimal ongoing compliance costs after the initial transition because the Commission
preliminarily believes that most of the costs would stem from pre-migration updates and testing.
The proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 would require investment advisers to maintain
records of allocations (if any), confirmations or affirmations if the adviser is a party to a contract
under that rule. Based on Form ADV filings as of December 2020, approximately 13,804
advisers registered with the Commission are required to maintain copies of certain books and
records relating to their advisory business.396 The Commission further estimates that 2,521
registered advisers required to maintain copies of certain books and records relating to their
advisory business would not be required to make and keep the proposed required records because
they do not have any institutional advisory clients.397 Therefore, the remaining 11,283 of these
advisers would be subject to the related proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 under the Advisers
Act, would enter a contract with a broker or dealer under proposed Rule 15c6-2 and therefore be
subject to the related proposed recordkeeping amendment.
As discussed above, based on staff experience, the Commission believes that many
advisers already have recordkeeping processes in place to retain records of confirmations
received, and allocations and affirmations sent to brokers or dealers. The Commission believes
 395 The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for asset servicing and testing to last two quarters. We
assume 2 operations specialists (at $149 per hour), 2 programmers (at $295 per hour), and 1
senior operations manager (at $397 per hour), working 40 hours per week. (2 × $149 + 2 × $295
+ 1 × $397) × 2 × 13 × 40 = $1,336,700.
396 See infra note 424.
397 See id.
207
these are customary and usual business practices for many advisers, but that some small and midsize advisers do not currently retain these records. Further, the Commission believes that the
vast majority of these books and records are kept in electronic fashion with an ability to capture a
date and time stamp, such as in a trade order management or other recordkeeping system,
through system logs of file transfers, email archiving or as part of DTC’s Institutional Trade
Processing services, but that some advisers maintain paper records (e.g., confirmations) and/or
communicate allocations by telephone. In addition, as noted in Section III.C, above, we believe
that up to 70% of institutional trades are affirmed by custodians, and therefore advisers may not
retain or have access to the affirmations these custodians sent to brokers or dealers.398
For those advisers maintaining date and time stamped electronic records already, we
estimate no incremental compliance costs. We estimate that the proposed amendments to rule
204-2 would result in an initial one-time compliance cost of approximately $30,500 for the small
and mid-size advisers399 that we estimate do not currently maintain these records, which we
amortize over three years for an estimated annual cost of approximately $10,167.
400 In addition,
 398 See DTCC ITP Forum Remarks, supra note 58.
399 For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, infra section VI, we estimated the number
of small and mid-sized advisers based on Form ADV Items 2.A.(2) (for mid-sized advisers) and
12 (for small advisers).
400 The estimate assumes that the proposed amendments to Rule 204-2 would result in an
initial increase in the collection of information burden estimate by 2 hours for the small and
medium size advisers that have institutional clients that we estimate do not currently maintain
these records. We estimate this number of advisers to be approximately 50% of small and
medium sized registered investment advisers that have institutional clients, or approximately 220
small and medium size advisers. See infra Table 1 (Summary of burden estimates for the
proposed amendment to Rule 204-2) note 4. The estimated 2 hours per adviser would be an
initial burden to update procedures and instruct personnel to retain these records in the advisers’
electronic recordkeeping systems, including any confirmations that they may receive in paper
208
we believe that only a small number of advisers, or 1% of advisers that have institutional clients,
do not send allocations or affirmations electronically to brokers or dealers (e.g., they
communicate them by telephone).401 We estimate that these advisers will incur initial one-time
costs of approximately $16,000 updating their policies and procedures and training their
personnel to send these communications through their existing electronic systems, which we
amortize over three years for an estimated annual cost of approximately $5,333.
402
In addition, we estimate that 70% of institutional trades are affirmed by custodians, and
therefore advisers may not retain or have access to the affirmations these custodians sent to
brokers or dealers. Because we do not know the number of advisers that correlate to these
trades, we estimate for purposes of this collection of information that 70% of advisers with
institutional clients make institutional trades that are affirmed by custodians. Therefore, we

format and do not currently retain. We believe that these advisers already have recordkeeping
systems to accommodate these records, which would include, at a minimum, spreadsheet formats
and email retention systems. As with our estimates relating to the previous amendments to
Advisers Act Rule 204-2, the Commission expects that performance of these functions would
most likely be allocated between compliance clerks and general clerks, with compliance clerks
performing 17% of the function and general clerks performing 83% of the function. We assume
20 minutes of a compliance clerk (at $76 per hour) and 100 minutes of a general clerk (at $68 per
hour). (1/3 x 76 + 5/3 x 68) x 220 = $30,507.
401 We estimate that currently registered large advisers that do not currently maintain
electronic records, would be part of the estimated 1% of advisers that would incur 2 hours each
to comply with the proposed amendment as described above. For new large advisers, we
estimate that there would be no incremental cost associated with this proposed amendment, as
we believe these advisers would implement electronic systems as part of their initial compliance
with Rule 204-2, and that these electronic systems would have an ability to capture a date and
time stamp.
402 We estimate 1% of 11,283 or 113 advisers do not sent allocations or affirmations
electronically. We assume, for each adviser, 20 minutes for a compliance clerk (at $76 per hour)
and 100 minutes of a general clerk (at $68 per hour). (1/3 x 76 + 5/3 x 68) x 113 = $15,669.
209
estimate that these advisers would incur initial one-time costs of approximately $1,095,000 to
direct their institutional clients’ custodians to copy the adviser on any affirmations sent through
email, or for the adviser to use its systems to issue affirmations, which we amortize over three
years for an estimated annual cost of approximately $365,500.
403
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would require a CMSP to establish, implement, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures. Based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rules 17Ad-22(d)(8) and 17Ad-22(e)(2),404 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
respondent CMSPs would incur an aggregate one-time cost of approximately $27,000.
405
The proposed rule would also require ongoing documentation activities with respect to
the annual report required to be submitted to the Commission. Based on the similar reporting
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23),406 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities
 403 We estimate 70% of 11,283 or 7,898 advisers affirm trades through custodians. We
assume, for each advisor, 20 minutes for a compliance clerk (at $76 per hour) and 100 minutes of
a general clerk (at $68 per hour). (1/3 x 76 + 5/3 x 68) x 7,898 = $1,095,189.
404 See Clearing Agency Standards, Exchange Act Release No. 68080 (Oct. 22, 2012), 77 FR
66219, 66260 (Nov. 2, 2012) (“Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release”); Standards for
Covered Clearing Agencies, Exchange Act Release No. 78961 (Sept. 28, 2016), 81 FR 70786,
70891–92 (Oct. 13, 2016) (“CCA Standards Adopting Release”).
405 There are currently three CMSPs and the Commission anticipates that one additional
entity may seek to become a CMSP in the next three years. The aggregate cost was estimated as
follows: (Assistant General Counsel at $602/hour x 8 hours = $4,816) + (Compliance Attorney at
$334/hour x 6 hours = $2,004) = $6,820 x 4 CMSPs equals $27,280.
406 See CCA Standards Adopting Release, supra note 404, at 70899.
210
required by proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would impose an aggregate annual cost of this ongoing
burden of approximately $44,000.
407
(4) Indirect Costs
In estimating these implementation costs, the Commission notes that market participants
who bear the direct costs of the actions they undertake to comply with the amendment to Rule
15c6-1 may pass these costs on to their customers. For example, retail and institutional investors
might not directly bear the cost of all of the necessary upgrades for a T+1 settlement cycle, but
might indirectly bear these costs as their broker-dealers might increase their fees to amortize the
costs of updates among their customers. The Commission is unable to quantify the overall
magnitude of the indirect costs that retail and institutional investors may bear, because such costs
would depend on the market power of each broker-dealer, and each broker-dealer’s willingness
to pass on the costs of migration to a T+1 standard settlement cycle to its customers. However,
the Commission preliminarily believes that in situations where broker-dealers have little or no
competition, broker-dealers may pass on as much as 100% of their initial costs to their
 407 This figure was calculated as follows: [(Compliance Attorney at $397/hour x 24 hours =
$9,528) + (Computer Operations Manager at $480/hour x 10 hours = $4,800) = $14,328 x 4
CMSPs = $57,312]. In addition, we estimate that the Inline XBRL requirement would require
respondent CMSPs to spend $900 each year to license and renew Inline XBRL compliance
software and/or services, and incur 1 internal burden hour to apply and review Inline XBRL tags
for the three disclosure requirements on the report, resulting in a total annual aggregate cost of
$5,188 [(Compliance Attorney at $397/hour x 1 hour = $397) + $900 in external costs = $1,297 x
4 CMSPs = $5,188]. In addition, respondent CMSPs that do not already have access to EDGAR
would be required to file a Form ID so as to obtain the access codes that are required to file or
submit a document on EDGAR. We anticipate that each respondent would require 0.15 hours to
complete the Form ID, and for purposes of the PRA, that 100% of the burden of preparation for
Form ID will be carried by each respondent internally. Because two respondent CMSPs already
have access to EDGAR, we anticipate that proposed amendments would result in a one-time
nominal increase of 0.30 burden hours for Form ID, which would not meaningfully add to, and
would effectively be encompassed by, the existing burden estimates associated with these
reports.
211
customers. As discussed above, this could be as high as the full amount of the estimated $5.44
million for broker-dealers that serve institutional investors, and $9.91 million for broker-dealers
that serve retail investors. However, in situations where broker-dealers face heavy competition
for customers, they may bear the full costs of the initial investment, and avoid passing on any
portion of these costs to their customers.
As noted in Part V.B.4, the ability of market participants to pass implementation costs on
to customers likely depends on their relative bargaining power. For example, CCPs, like many
other utilities, exhibit many of the characteristics of natural monopolies and, as a result, may
have market power, particularly relative to broker-dealers who submit trades for clearing. This
means that CCPs may be able to share implementation costs they directly face related to
shortening the settlement cycle with broker-dealers through higher clearing fees. Conversely, to
the extent that institutional investors have market power relative to broker-dealers, brokerdealers may not be in a position to impose indirect costs on them.
(5) Industry-Wide Costs
To estimate the aggregate, industry-wide cost of a transition to a T+1 standard settlement
cycle, the Commission takes its own per-entity estimates and multiplies them by our estimate of
the respective number of entities. The Commission preliminarily estimates that there are 1,229
buy-side firms, 156 self-clearing broker-dealers, and 49 custodian banks.408 Additionally, while
 408 The estimate for the number of buy-side firms is based on the Commission’s 13(f)
holdings information filers with over $1 billion in assets under management, as of December 31,
2020. The estimate for the number of broker-dealers is based on FINRA FOCUS Reports of
firms reporting as self-clearing. See supra note 312 and accompanying text. The estimate for the
number of custodian banks is based on the number of “settling banks” listed in DTC’s Member
Directories, available at http://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories.
212
there are three Matching/ETC Providers, the Commission believes that only one of these is
currently providing services in the U.S. We estimate there are 1,282 broker-dealers that would
incur investor education costs. One way to establish a total industry initial compliance cost
estimate would be to multiply each estimated per-entity cost by the respective number of entities
and sum these values, which would result in an estimate of $4.97 billion.409 The Commission,
however, preliminarily believes that this estimate is likely to overstate the true initial cost of
transition to a T+1 settlement cycle for a number of reasons. First, our per-entity estimates do
not account for the heterogeneity in market participant size, which may have a significant impact
on the costs that market participants face. While the BCG Study included both estimates of the
number of entities in different size categories as well as estimates of costs that an entity in each
size category is likely to incur, it did not provide sufficient underlying information to allow the
Commission to estimate the relationship between participant size and compliance cost and thus
we cannot produce comparable estimates. The Commission solicits comment on the extent to
which market participants believe that the compliance costs for proposed Rule 15c6-1(a) would
scale with market participant size.
Second, investments by third-party service providers may mean that many of the
estimated compliance costs for market participants are duplicated. The BCG Study suggests that
“leverage” from service providers may yield a savings of $194 million, reducing aggregate costs
 409 Calculated as 156 broker-dealers (self-clearing) × $9,914,000 + 1,282 broker-dealers
(self-clearing and introducing) × $30,000 + 49 custodian banks × $1,337,000 + 1,229 buy-side
firms × $2,673,000 + 1 Matching/ETC Providers × $12,575,000 + 2 FMUs × $12,575,000 + (IA
costs of 30,500 + 16,000 + 1,095,000) + (CMSP initial costs of $26,000) = $4,974,556,500.
213
by approximately 29%.410 The Commission seeks further comment on the extent to which the
efficiencies generated by the investments of service providers might reduce the compliance costs
of market participants. Taking into account potential cost reductions due to repurposing existing
systems and using service providers as described above, the Commission preliminarily believes
that $3.5 billion represents a reasonable range for the total industry initial compliance costs.411
In addition to these initial costs, a transition to a shorter settlement cycle may also result
in certain ongoing industry-wide costs. Though the Commission preliminarily believes that a
move to a shorter settlement cycle would generally bring with it a reduced reliance on manual
processing, a shorter settlement cycle may also exacerbate remaining operational risk. This is
because a shorter settlement cycle would provide market participants with less time to resolve
errors. For example, if there is an entry error in the trade match details sent by either
counterparty for a trade, both counterparties would have one extra day to resolve the error under
the baseline than in a T+1 environment. For these errors, a shorter settlement cycle may increase
the probability that the error ultimately results in a settlement fail. However, the Commission
preliminarily believes that a large variety of operational errors are possible in the clearance and
settlement process and some of these errors are likely to be infrequent, the Commission is unable
to quantify the impact that a shorter settlement cycle may have on the ongoing industry-wide
costs stemming from a potential increase in operational risk.
 410 See BCG Study, supra note 22, at 79.
411 The lower bound of this range is calculated as ($4.97 billion x (1 – 0.29)) = $3.5 billion.
214
D. Reasonable Alternatives
1. Amend 15c6-1(c) to T+2
The Commission is proposing to delete Rule 15c6-1(c) that establishes a T+4 settlement
cycle for firm commitment offerings for securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. ET, unless
otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.412 The Commission
has considered amending Rule 15c6-1(c) to shorten the settlement cycle for firm commitment
offerings to T+2.
The T+1 Report stated that paragraph (c) is rarely used in the current T+2 settlement
environment.413 The Commission adopted paragraph (c) of Rule 15c6-1 in 1995, two years
after Rule 15c6-1 was originally adopted.414 At the time, the rule included a limited exemption
from the requirements under paragraph (a) of the rule for the sale for cash pursuant to a firm
commitment offering registered under the Securities Act.415 The exemption for firm
commitment offerings was added in response to public comments stating that new issue
 412 See supra Part III.A.3.
413 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 33–35.
414 See Prospectus Delivery; Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle, Exchange Act Release
No. 34-35705 (May 11, 1995), 60 FR 26604 (May 17, 1995) (“1995 Amendments Adopting
Release”).
415 The exemption was limited to sales to an underwriter by an issuer and initial sales by the
underwriting syndicate and selling group. Any secondary resales of such securities were to settle
on a T+3 settlement cycle. T+3 Adopting Release, supra note 9, at 52898.
215
securities could not settle on T+3 because prospectuses could not be printed prior to the trade
date (the date on which the securities are priced).416
As discussed further in Part III.E.4, Rule 172 has implemented an “access equals
delivery” model that permits, with certain exceptions, final prospectus delivery obligations to
be satisfied by the filing of a final prospectus with the Commission, rather than delivery of the
prospectus to purchasers. As a result of these changes, broker-dealers generally do not require
time to print and deliver prospectus—a point originally cited by many commenters in support
of adopting paragraph (c).417
Although rarely used in the current T+2 settlement environment, the IWG expects a
T+1 standard settlement cycle would increase reliance on paragraph (c).418 The T+1 Report
further stated that the IWG recommends retaining paragraph (c) but amending it to establish a
standard settlement cycle of T+2 for firm commitment offerings.419 The T+1 Report cites
issues with respect to documentation and other operational elements of equity offerings that
may delay settlement to T+2 in a T+1 environment. As the Commission is not currently aware
of any specific documentation associated with firm commitment offerings that cannot be
completed by T+1, the Commission preliminarily believes that the need to complete possibly
complex transaction documentation prior to settlement does not justify proposing a T+2
standard settlement cycle for equity offerings.
 416 Id.
417 Id. at 32.
418 T+1 Report, supra note 18, at 33–35.
419 Id. at 33.
216
In addition, establishing T+1 as the standard settlement cycle for these firm commitment
offerings, and thereby aligning the settlement cycle with the standard settlement cycle for
securities generally, would reduce exposures of underwriters, dealers, and investors to credit and
market risk, and better ensure that the primary issuance of securities is available to settle
secondary market trading in such securities. The Commission believes that harmonizing the
settlement cycle for such firm commitment offerings with secondary market trading, to the
greatest extent possible, limits the potential for operational risk. In addition, if paragraph (c) is
removed as proposed, paragraph (d) would continue to provide underwriters and the parties to a
transaction the ability to agree, in advance of a particular transaction, to a settlement cycle other
than the standard set forth in Rule 15c6-1(a).
Therefore, in the Commission’s view, deleting paragraph (c) while retaining paragraph
(d) provides sufficient flexibility for market participants to manage the potential need for
longer than T+1 settlement on certain firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. that
may include “complex” documentation because paragraph (d) would continue to permit the
underwriters and the parties to a transaction to agree, in advance of entering the transaction,
whether T+1 settlement or some other settlement timeframe is appropriate for the transaction.
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that having the underwriters and the parties
to the transaction agree in advance of entering the transaction whether to deviate from the
standard settlement cycle established in paragraph (a) would promote transparency among the
parties, in advance of entering the transaction, as to the length of the time that it takes to
complete complex documentation with respect to the transaction.
2. Propose 17Ad-27 to Require Certain Outcomes
The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-27 to require a CMSP establish, implement,
maintain and enforce policies and procedures to facilitate straight-through processing for
217
transactions involving broker-dealers and their customers.420 Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 also
would require a CMSP to submit every twelve months to the Commission a report that describes
the following: (i) the CMSP’s current policies and procedures for facilitating straight-through
processing; (ii) its progress in facilitating straight-through processing during the twelve month
period covered by the report; and (iii) the steps the CMSP intends to take to facilitate and
promote straight-through processing during the twelve month period that follows the period
covered by the report.
The Commission has taken a “policies and procedures” approach in developing the
proposed rule because it preliminarily believes such an approach will remain effective over time
as CMSPs consider and offer new technologies and operations to improve the settlement of
institutional trades. The Commission also believes that improving the CMSPs’ systems to
facilitate straight-through processing can help market participants consider additional ways to
make their own systems more efficient. In addition, a “policies and procedures” approach can
help ensure that a CMSP considers in a holistic fashion how the obligations it applies to its users
will advance the implementation of methodologies, operational capabilities, systems, or services
that support straight-through processing.
The Commission has considered as an alternative to the policies and procedures approach
in proposed Rule 17Ad-27, proposing a rule to require CMSPs to achieve certain outcomes that
would facilitate straight-through processing. For example, the Commission could propose to
require that a CMSP do the following: (i) enable the users of its service to complete the
matching, confirmation, or affirmation of the securities transaction as soon as technologically
 420 See supra Part III.D (discussing the proposed rule); see also supra Part III.D.1 (discussing
straight-through processing).
218
and operationally practicable and no later than the end of the day on which the transaction was
effected by the parties to the transaction; or (ii) forward or otherwise submit the transaction for
settlement as soon as technologically and operationally practicable, as if using fully automated
systems.
The Commission believes that these requirements would achieve certain discrete
objectives with respect to straight-through processing and would promote prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement. The Commission believes, however, that the proposed approach
requires policies and procedures that include a holistic review and framework for considering
how systems and processes facilitate straight-through processing and that can adapt over time to
changes in technology and operations, both among and beyond the CMSP’s systems.
E. Request for Comment
The Commission solicits comment on the potential economic impact of the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the proposed deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c), proposed new Rule
15c6-2, the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2, and proposed new Rule 17Ad-27. In addition,
the Commission solicits comment on related issues that may inform the Commission’s views
regarding the economic impact of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the proposed
deletion of Rule 15c6-1(c), proposed new Rule 15c6-2, the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2,
and proposed new Rule 17Ad-27 as well as alternatives to the proposed amendments, deletion,
and new rules. The Commission in particular seeks comment on the following:
144. The Commission invites commenters to provide additional data on the time it
takes to complete each step within the current clearance and settlement process. What
are current constraints or impediments for each step within the clearance and settlement
process that would limit the ability to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1?
Do these constraints or impediments vary by market participant type?
219
145. The Commission invites commenters to provide additional data on the
expected collateral efficiency gains from a T+1 standard settlement cycle. How
would clearing fund deposits change as a result of the proposed amendment? To
what extent does this change fully represent the change to the level of risk associated
with the settlement cycle for securities transactions?
146. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the impact of a T+1
settlement cycle on broker-dealers and their customers, including custodians who
may hold securities on behalf of said customers. What types of adaptations would be
necessary to comply with a T+1 settlement cycle, and what are their relative costs and
benefits?
147. The Commission invites commenters to provide data regarding the extent to
which a broker-dealer engages in “internalization” of a transaction on behalf of a
customer. How prevalent are internalization practices? How does the volume of
internalization compare to the volume of transactions that are submitted for
clearing?421
148. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the potential impact of a T+1
standard settlement cycle with respect to cross-border and cross-asset class
transactions. Would a T+1 standard settlement cycle make any cross-border or crossasset transactions more or less costly?
149. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the anticipated market changes,
if any, if the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) were not adopted. Which
activities necessary for compliance with a T+1 standard settlement cycle would occur
 421 See Part II.B.2 (further discussing internalization by broker-dealers).
220
in the absence of the proposed rule amendment and how quickly would they occur?
150. In addition to the prospective impact on costs/burdens, the Commission solicits
comments related to the credit, market, liquidity, legal, and operational risks (increase
or decrease) associated with shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+1, and in
particular, quantification of such risks.
151. Are there types of customers other than institutional customers that would be
affected by proposed Rule 15c6-2? If so, please describe what types of customers.
Would the rules impose an unanticipated burden on these customers? Please explain.
152. What are the benefits and costs of requiring broker dealers to enter into written
agreements with customers engaging in the trade date allocation, confirmation and
affirmation process where such agreements require the process to be completed by the
end of the day on trade date?
153. What are the relative burdens of proposed Rule 15c6-2 on the different market
participants involved in the allocation, confirmation, and affirmation process, particularly
smaller market participants?
VI. Paperwork Reduction Act
Two of the rule proposals, proposed Rule 17Ad-27 and the proposed amendment to Rule
204-2(a), contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).422 The Commission is submitting the proposed collections of
information to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with
the PRA. For the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2(a), the title of the information collection is
“Rule 204–2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940” (OMB control number 3235–0278).
 422 See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
221
For proposed Rule 17Ad-27, the title of the information collection is “Clearing Agency
Standards for Operation and Governance” (OMB Control No. 3235-0695). An agency may not
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless
it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
A. Proposed Amendment to Rule 204-2
Under Section 204 of the Advisers Act, investment advisers registered or required to
register with the Commission under Section 203 of the Advisers Act must make and keep for
prescribed periods such records (as defined in Section 3(a)(37) of the Exchange Act), furnish
copies thereof, and make and disseminate such reports as the Commission, by rule, may
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
Rule 204-2 sets forth the requirements for maintaining and preserving specified books and
records. This collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275. 204-2 and is mandatory. The
Commission staff uses the collection of information in its regulatory and examination program.
Responses to the requirements of the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 that are provided to the
Commission in the context of its regulatory and examination program would be kept confidential
subject to the provisions of applicable law.
423
The proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 would require advisers to maintain records of
certain documents described in proposed Rule 15c6-2 if the adviser is a party to a contract under
that rule. Rule 15c6-2 specifically identifies “allocations, confirmations or affirmations” as
documents that must be completed no later than the end of the day on trade date. The
 423 See Section 210(b) of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b–10(b).
222
respondents to this collection of information are approximately 13,804 advisers registered with
the Commission.
424 The Commission further estimates that 2,521 of these registered advisers
would not be required to make and keep the proposed required records because they do not have
any institutional advisory clients.
425 Therefore, the remaining 11,283 of these advisers, or
81.74% of the total registered advisers that are subject to Rule 204-2, would enter a contract with
a broker or dealer under proposed Rule 15c6-2 and therefore be subject to the related proposed
recordkeeping amendment.
As discussed above, based on staff experience, the Commission believes that many
advisers already have recordkeeping processes in place to retain records of confirmations
received, and allocations and affirmations sent to brokers or dealers.
426 The Commission
believes that while these are customary and usual business practices for many advisers, some
small and mid-size advisers do not currently retain these records. Further, the Commission
believes that the vast majority of these books and records are kept in electronic fashion in a trade
order management or other recordkeeping system, through system logs of file transfers, email
archiving or as part of DTC’s Institutional Trade Processing services, but that some advisers
maintain paper records (e.g., confirmations) and/or communicate allocations by telephone. In
 424 Based on data from Form ADV as of December, 2020.
425 Based on data from Form ADV as of December, 2020, this figure represents registered
investment advisers that: (i) report no clients that are registered investment companies in
response to Item 5.D, (ii) do not report any institutional separately managed accounts in Item
5.D., or separately managed account exposures in Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, and (iii) do not
advise any reported hedge funds as per Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D.
426 See supra Section III.C.
223
addition, as noted in Section III.C, above, we believe that up to 70% of institutional trades are
affirmed by custodians, and therefore advisers may not retain or have access to the affirmations
these custodians sent to brokers or dealers.
427 Also as noted above, based on staff experience,
the Commission believes that many advisers send allocations and affirmations electronically to
brokers or dealers, and therefore these records are already date and time stamped in many
instances. Nevertheless, the proposed amendments would explicitly add a new requirement to
date and time stamp allocations and affirmations (but not confirmations), and thus increase this
collection of information burden. The Commission estimates that the associated increase in
burden would be included in our estimate described in the chart below for advisers that we
believe do not electronically send allocations and affirmations to their brokers or dealers.
We describe the estimated burdens associated with the proposed recordkeeping
amendment below. These estimated changes from the currently approved burden are due to the
estimated increase in the internal hour and internal time cost burden that would be due to the
proposed amendment, and the increase in the number of registered investment advisers (an
increase of 80 advisers).

Notes:
1. We believe that the estimated internal hour burdens associated with the proposed amendment would be one-time initial
burdens, and we amortize these burdens over three years.
2. As with our estimates relating to the previous amendments to Advisers Act Rule 204-2, the Commission expects that
performance of these functions would most likely be allocated between compliance clerks and general clerks, with compliance
clerks performing 17% of the function and general clerks performing 83% of the function. Data from SIFMA's Office Salaries in
the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and inflation, and multiplied
by 2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead, suggest that costs for these position are $76 and $68,
respectively. A blended hourly rate is therefore: (.17 x $76) + (.83 x $68) = $69.36 per hour.
3. Under the currently approved PRA for Rule 204-2, there is no cost burden other than the cost of the hour burden described
herein, and we believe that the proposed amendment would not result in any cost burden other than the cost of the hour burden.
4. Based on staff experience, we estimate that approximately 50% of small and mid-sized registered investment advisers that
have institutional clients, do not currently maintain the proposed records. Based on Form ADV data as of December 2020, we
estimate that there are 199 and 241 mid-sized and small entity RIAs, respectively, that would be required to retain the proposed
new records, for a total of 440 advisers (these are advisers that report the following on Form ADV Part 1A as of December 2020:
(i) having any clients that are registered investment companies in response to Item 5.D, (ii) having any institutional separately
managed accounts in Item 5.D., or separately managed account exposures in Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, or (iii) advising any
reported hedge funds as per Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D). The categories of mid-size and small entity advisers are based on
responses to the following Items of Form ADV Part 1A: Item 2.a.(2) (mid-size RIA) and Items 5.F. and 12 (small entity). 50% of
440 advisers = 220 advisers.
5. We estimate an initial burden of 2 hours per adviser, to update procedures and instruct personnel to retain the proposed
required records in the advisers’ electronic recordkeeping systems, including any confirmations that they may receive in paper
format and do not currently retain. We believe that these advisers already have recordkeeping systems to accommodate these
records, which would include, at a minimum, spreadsheet formats and email retention systems which have an ability to capture a
date and time stamp. For those advisers maintaining date and time stamped electronic records already, we estimate no
incremental compliance costs.
6. We believe that only a small number of advisers, or 1% of advisers that have institutional clients, do not send allocations or
affirmations electronically to brokers or dealers (e.g., they communicate them by telephone). 1% of 11,283 RIAs with
institutional clients = 112.83 advisers (rounded to 113). For new large advisers, we estimate that there would be no incremental
cost associated with this proposed amendment, as we believe these advisers would implement electronic systems as part of their
initial compliance with Rule 204-2, and that these electronic systems would have an ability to capture a date and time stamp.
7. We estimate that these advisers would incur an initial burden of 2 hours of updating their procedures and training their
personnel to send these communications through their existing electronic systems (such as, at a minimum, their current
spreadsheet formats and current email and electronic retention system to maintain electronic records with date and time stamps).
225
Because these email and electronic retention systems would provide date and time stamps, we estimate there would be no
incremental compliance costs in connection with the proposed date and time stamp requirement.
8. As noted above, we estimate that 70% of institutional trades are affirmed by custodians, and therefore advisers may not retain
or have access to the affirmations these custodians sent to brokers or dealers. We believe that some of these advisers themselves,
however, sometimes send affirmations to brokers or dealers. Because we do not know the number of advisers that correlate to
these trades, we estimate for purposes of this collection of information that 70% of advisers with institutional clients make
institutional trades that are affirmed by custodians. This estimate equals 7,898.1 advisers, rounded to 7,898 advisers (70% of
11,283 RIAs with institutional clients = approximately 7,898 advisers).
9. We estimate that the proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would result in an initial increase in the collection of information
burden estimate by 2 hours for these advisers, to direct their institutional clients’ custodians to electronically copy the adviser on
any affirmations sent through email or for the adviser to use its systems to issue affirmations.
10. 146.74 hours + 75.37 hours + 5,267.97 hours = 5,490.08 hours.
11. 5,490.08 aggregate hours per year / 13,804 total RIAs that are subject to Rule 204-2 = a blended average of 0.4 hours per
adviser per year.
12. The currently approved collection of information burden is 2,764,563 aggregate hours for 13,724 advisers, or 201.44 hours
per adviser. The proposed new collection of information burden would add approximately 0.4 blended hours per adviser per
year, for a total estimate of 201.84 blended hours per adviser per year, or 2,786,199 aggregate hours under amended Rule 204-2
for all registered advisers subject to the rule (201.84 blended hours per adviser x 13,804 RIAs subject to Rule 204-2 = 2,786,199
aggregate burden hours for RIAs).
13. (201.84 estimated revised burden hours per adviser x $69.36 per hour) x 13,804 RIAs = $193,250,787.60 revised aggregate
annual cost of the hour burden for Rule 204-2.
B. Proposed Rule 17Ad-27
The purpose of the collections under proposed Rule 17Ad-27 is to ensure that CMSPs
facilitate the ongoing development of operational and technological improvements associated
with the straight-through processing of institutional trades, which may in turn facilitate further
shortening of the settlement cycle in the future. The collections are mandatory. To the extent
that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information,
such information would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law.428
 428 See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides
an exemption for trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person
and privileged or confidential. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Exemption 8 of the Freedom of
Information Act provides an exemption for matters that are contained in or related to
examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions. See 5 U.S.C.
552(b)(8).
226
Respondents under this rule are the three CMSPs to which the Commission has granted
an exemption from registration as a clearing agency. The Commission anticipates that one
additional entity may seek to become a CMSP in the next three years, and so for purposes of this
proposal the Commission has assumed four respondents.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would require a CMSP to establish, implement, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures. Based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rules 17Ad-22(d)(8) and 17Ad-22(e)(2),429 the Commission estimates that respondent CMSPs
would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 56 hours to create new policies and
procedures,
430 and that the aggregate cost of this one time burden would be $27,280.
431
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would impose ongoing burdens on a respondent CMSP as
follows: (i) ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to the written policies and
procedures required by the proposed rule; and (ii) ongoing documentation activities with respect
to the required annual report. Based on the similar reporting requirements and the corresponding
burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23),432 the
 429 See Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, supra note 404; CCA Standards
Adopting Release, supra note 404.
430 This figure was calculated as follows: (Assistant General Counsel for 8 hours +
Compliance Attorney for 6 hours) = 14 hours x 4 respondent CMSPs = 56 hours.
431 This figure was calculated as follows: (Assistant General Counsel at $602/hour x 8 hours
= $4,816) + (Compliance Attorney at $334/hour x 6 hours = $2,004) = $6,820 x 4 CMSPs equals
$27,280.
432 See CCA Standards Adopting Release, supra note 404, at 70899.
227
Commission estimates that the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would
impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent CMSPs of 140 hours,
433 and an aggregate cost
of $58,900.
434 The total industry cost is estimated to be $84,592.

C. Request for Comment
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits comments to:
154. Evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the
proper performance of the Commission’s functions, including whether the information
shall have practical utility;
155. Evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimates of the burdens of the
proposed collections of information;
 433 This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 25 hours + Computer
Operations Manager for 10 hours) = 34 hours x 4 respondent CMSPs = 136 hours. As discussed
previously, supra note 407, the Commission estimates that the Inline XBRL requirement would
require respondent CMSPs to incur one additional ongoing burden hour to apply and review
Inline XBRL tags, as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 1 hour) x 4 CMSPs = 4 hours. Taken
together, the total ongoing burden is 140 hours (136 hours + 4 hours = 140 hours).
434 This figure was calculated as follows: [(Compliance Attorney at $397/hour x 24 hours =
$9,528) + (Computer Operations Manager at $480/hour x 10 hours = $4,800)] = $14,328 x 4
CMSPs = $57,312. The Commission also estimates the costs associated with the one burden
hour associated with applying and review Inline XBRL tags as follows: (Compliance Attorney at
$397/hour x 1 hour = $397) x 4 CMSPs = $1,588. Taken together, the total amount is $58,900
($57,312 + $1,588 = $58,900).
435 This figure was calculated as follows: $27,280 (industry one-time burden) + $58,900
(industry ongoing burden) = $84,592.
228
156. Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected;
157. Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of collection of
information on those who are to respond, including through the use of automated
collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and
158. Evaluate whether the proposed rules and rule amendments would have any effects
on any other collection of information not previously identified in this section.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct
them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and should also send a copy of their comments to Secretary, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File Number S7-[
]-22. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to this collection
of information should be in writing, with reference to File Number S7-[ ]-22 and be submitted to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA/PA Services, 100 F Street NE,
Washington, DC 20549-2736. As OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collection
of information between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to OMB is best assured of
having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
VII. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996,436 a rule is
“major” if it has resulted, or is likely to result in: an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or
 436 Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).
229
significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation. The Commission requests
comment on whether the proposed rules and rule amendments would be a “major” rule for
purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. In addition, the
Commission solicits comment and empirical data on: the potential effect on the U.S. economy on
annual basis; any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and
any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.
VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires the Commission, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities.437 Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act,438 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules to determine the impact of such rulemaking
on “small entities.”439 Section 605(b) of the RFA states that this requirement shall not apply to
any proposed rule which, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities.440 The Commission has prepared the following initial
regulatory flexibility analysis in accordance with Section 603(a) of the RFA.
 437 See 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
438 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
439 Section 601(b) of the RFA permits agencies to formulate their own definitions of “small
entities.” See 5 U.S.C. 601(b). The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
entity” for the purposes of rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. These definitions, as
relevant to this rulemaking, are set forth in 17 CFR 240.0-10.

A. Proposed Rules and Amendments for Rules 15c6-1, 15c6-2, and 204-2
1. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Actions
The Commission is proposing to amend Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 to shorten the
standard settlement cycle for securities transactions (other than those excluded by the rule) from
T+2 to T+1. The Commission believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 15c6-1 to shorten
the standard settlement cycle from two days to one day would offer market participants benefits
by reducing exposure to credit, market, and liquidity risk, as well as related reductions to overall
systemic risk.
The Commission is also proposing new Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2 to prohibit brokerdealers from entering into contracts with their institutional customers unless those contracts
require that the parties complete allocations, confirmations, and affirmations by the end of the
trade date. The Commission believes that new Rule 15c6-2 would help facilitate settlement of
these institutional trades in a T+1 or shorter standard settlement cycle by promoting the timely
transmission of trade data necessary to achieve settlement. Furthermore, the Commission
believes that proposed Rule 15c6-2 would foster continued improvements in institutional trade
processing, which should in turn also further improve accuracy and efficiency, reduce fails, and
in turn, collectively reduce operational risk.
The Commission is proposing a related amendment to investment adviser recordkeeping
rule under the Advisers Act designed to ensure that advisers that are parties to contracts under
proposed Rule 15c6-2 retain records of confirmations received, and of the allocations and
affirmations sent to a broker or dealer, with a date and time stamp that indicates when the
allocation or affirmation was sent to the broker or dealer.
231
2. Legal Basis
The Commission proposes amendments to Rule 15c6-1 and new Rule 15c6-2 pursuant to
authority set forth in the Exchange Act, particularly Sections 15(c)(6),441 17A,442 and 23(a).
443
The Commission proposes an amendment to Rule 204-2 pursuant to authority set forth in
Sections 204 and 211 of the Advisers Act.
444
3. Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rule and Proposed Rule
Amendments
Paragraph (c) of Exchange Act Rule 0-10 provides that, for purposes of Commission
rulemaking in accordance with the provisions of the RFA, when used with reference to a broker
or dealer, the Commission has defined the term “small entity” to mean a broker or dealer: (1)
with total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the
prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a5(d) under the Exchange Act,445 or if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with
total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business
day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and (2) is
 441 15 U.S.C. 78o(c)(6).
442 15 U.S.C. 78q-1.
443 15 U.S.C. 78w(a).
444 15 U.S.C. 80b-4 and 80b-11.
445 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c).
232
not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization.446
Under Commission rules, for the purposes of the Advisers Act and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, an investment adviser generally is a small entity if it: (i) has assets under
management having a total value of less than $25 million; (ii) did not have total assets of $5
million or more on the last day of the most recent fiscal year; and (iii) does not control, is not
controlled by, and is not under common control with another investment adviser that has assets
under management of $25 million or more, or any person (other than a natural person) that had
total assets of $5 million or more on the last day of its most recent fiscal year.447
The proposed amendments to Rule 15c6-1 would prohibit broker-dealers, including those
that are small entities, from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a
security (other than an exempted security, government security, municipal security, commercial
paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and
delivery of securities no later than the first business day after the date of the contract unless
otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction. Proposed Rule 15c6-2
would prohibit broker-dealers, where the broker-dealer has agreed with its customer to engage in
an allocation, confirmation, or affirmation process, from effecting or entering into a contract for
the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted security, a government security, a
municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) on behalf of a
customer unless such broker or dealer has entered into a written agreement with the customer
that requires the allocation, confirmation, affirmation, or any combination thereof, be completed
 446 17 CFR 240.0-10(d).
447 See 17 CFR 275.0-7.
233
no later than the end of the day on trade date in such form as may be necessary to achieve
settlement in compliance with Rule 15c6-1(a). Based on FOCUS Report data, the Commission
estimates that, as of June 30, 2021, approximately 1,439 of broker-dealers might be deemed
small entities for purposes of this analysis.
The proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 would require that advisers that are parties to
contracts under proposed Rule 15c6-2 retain records of confirmations received, and of the
allocations and affirmations sent to a broker or dealer, with a date and time stamp for each
allocation (as applicable) and each affirmation that indicates when the allocation or affirmation
was sent to the broker or dealer. As discussed in Part VI above, the Commission estimates that
based on IARD data as of December 30, 2020, approximately 11,283 investment advisers would
be subject to the proposed amendment to rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act. Our proposed
amendment would not affect most investment advisers that are small entities (“small advisers”)
because they are generally registered with one or more state securities authorities and not with
the Commission. Under Section 203A of the Advisers Act, most small advisers are prohibited
from registering with the Commission and are regulated by state regulators.448 Based on IARD
data, the Commission estimates that as of December 2020, approximately 431 advisers registered
with the Commission are small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.449 Of these, the
 448 15 U.S.C. 80b-3a.
449 Based on responses from registered investment adviser to Items 5.F. and 12 of Form
ADV.
234
Commission anticipates that 199, or 46% of small advisers registered with the Commission,
would be subject to the proposed amendment under the Advisers Act.450
4. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements
The proposed amendments to Rule 15c6-1 would not impose any new reporting or
recordkeeping requirements on broker-dealers that are small entities. However, the proposed
amendments to Rule 15c6-1 may impact certain broker-dealers, including those that are small
entities, to the extent that broker-dealers may need to make changes to their business operations
and incur certain costs in order to operate in a T+1 environment.
For example, conversion to a T+1 standard settlement cycle may require broker-dealers,
including those that are small entities, to make changes to their business practices, as well as to
their computer systems, and/or to deploy new technology solutions. Implementation of these
changes may require broker-dealers to incur new or increased costs, which may vary based on
the business model of individual broker-dealers as well as other factors.
Additionally, conversion to a T+1 standard settlement cycle may also result in an increase
in costs to certain broker-dealers who finance the purchase of customer securities until the
broker-dealer receives payment from its customers. To pay for securities purchases, many
customers liquidate other securities or money fund balances held for them by their broker-dealers
in consolidated accounts such as cash management accounts. However, some broker-dealers
may elect to finance the purchase of customer securities until the broker-dealer receives payment
 450 Based on data from Form ADV as of December 2020, this figure represents registered
investment advisers that: (i) report clients that are registered investment companies in response
to Item 5.D, (ii) report any institutional separately managed accounts in Item 5.D., or have
particular separately managed account exposures in Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, or (iii) advise
reported hedge funds as per Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D.
235
from its customers for those customers that do not choose to liquidate other securities or have a
sufficient money fund balance prior to trade execution to pay for securities purchases. Brokerdealers that elect to finance the purchase of customer securities may incur an increase in costs in
a T+1 environment resulting from settlement occurring one day earlier unless the broker-dealer
can expedite customer payments.
Proposed Rule 15c6-2 would not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping
requirements on broker-dealers that are small entities. However, the proposed rule may impact
certain broker-dealers, including those that are small entities, to the extent that broker-dealers
may need to make changes to their business operations and incur certain costs in order to achieve
trade date completion of institutional trade allocations, confirmations, and affirmations. For
example, completion of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations on trade date may require
broker-dealers, including those that are small entities, to make changes to their business
practices, as well as to their computer systems, and/or to deploy new technology solutions.
Implementation of these changes may require broker-dealers to incur new or increased costs,
which may vary based on the business model of individual broker-dealers as well as other
factors.
The proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 imposes certain reporting and compliance
requirements on certain investment advisers, including those that are small entities. It would
require them to retain records of each confirmation received, and any allocation and each
affirmation sent given to a broker or dealer, with a date and time stamp for each allocation (if
applicable) and affirmation that indicates when the allocation or affirmation was sent to the
broker or dealer. The reasons for and objectives of, the proposed amendment to the books and
records rule are discussed in more detail in Part III.C. These requirements as well as the costs
236
and burdens on investment advisers, including those that are small entities, are discussed in Parts
V and VI and below. As discussed above, there are approximately 431 small advisers, and
approximately 199 small advisers would be subject to amendments to the books and records rule.
As discussed in Part VI.A, the proposed amendments to Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act
would increase the annual burden by approximately 0.4 blended hours per adviser per year, or an
increased burden of 172.4 blended hours in the aggregate for small advisers.451 The Commission
therefore believes the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our
proposed amendments would be approximately $11,957.66.
452
5. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules
The Commission believes that no federal rules duplicate, overlap or conflict with the
proposed amendments to Rule 15c6-1, proposed Rule 15c6-2, or the proposed amendment to
Rule 204-2.
6. Significant Alternatives
The RFA requires that the Commission include in its regulatory flexibility analysis a
description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which would accomplish the
stated objectives of applicable statutes and which would minimize any significant economic
impact of the proposed rule on small entities.453 Pursuant to Section 3(a) of the RFA, the
Commission’s initial regulatory flexibility analysis must consider certain types of alternatives,
 451 0.4 hour x 431 small advisers = 172.4 blended hours in the aggregate for small advisers.
452 172.4 blended hours x $69.36 per hour = $11,957.66. See Part VI.A for a discussion of
the monetized cost of the hour burden per adviser.
453 5 U.S.C. 603(c).
237
including: (a) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables
that take into account the resources available to small entities; (b) the clarification, consolidation,
or simplification of the compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities;
(c) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (d) an exemption from coverage of
the rule, or any part of thereof, for such small entities.454
The Commission considered alternatives to the proposed amendments to Rule 15c6-1 that
would accomplish the stated objectives of the amendment without disproportionately burdening
broker-dealers that are small entities, including: differing compliance requirements or timetables;
clarifying, consolidating or simplifying the compliance requirements; using performance rather
than design standards; or providing an exemption for certain or all broker-dealers that are small
entities. The purpose of Rule 15c6-1 is to establish a standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer
transactions. Alternatives, such as different compliance requirements or timetables, or
exemptions, for Rule 15c6-1, or any part thereof, for small entities would prevent the
establishment of a standard settlement cycle and create substantial confusion over when
transactions will settle. Allowing small entities to settle at a time later than T+1 could create a
two-tiered market in which order flow for small entities would not coincide with that of other
firms operating on a T+1 settlement cycle. Additionally, the Commission believes that
establishing a single timetable (i.e., compliance date) for all broker-dealers, including small
entities, to comply with the amendment is necessary to ensure that the transition to a T+1
standard settlement cycle takes place in an orderly manner that minimizes undue disruptions in
the securities markets. In particular, because broker-dealers do not always know the identity of
their counterparty when they enter a transaction, providing broker-dealers that are small entities
 454 Id.
238
with an exemption from the standard settlement cycle would likely create substantial confusion
over when a transaction will settle. With respect to using performance rather than design
standards, the Commission used performance standards to the extent appropriate under the
statute. For example, broker-dealers have the flexibility to settle transactions under a standard
settlement cycle shorter than T+1. For firm commitment offerings, small entities do retain the
option under paragraph (d) to agree with their counterparty in advance of the transaction to use a
settlement cycle other than T+1. In addition, under the proposed rule amendment, broker-dealers
retain flexibility to tailor their contracts, systems and processes to choose how to comply with
the rule most effectively. In Part V.C.5.b)(3), the Commission preliminarily estimates the costs
likely to be incurred by broker-dealers to implement a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
The Commission also considered alternatives to proposed Rule 15c6-2 that would
accomplish the stated objectives of the new rule without disproportionately burdening brokerdealers that are small entities, including: differing compliance requirements or timetables;
clarifying, consolidating or simplifying the compliance requirements; using performance rather
than design standards; or providing an exemption for certain or all broker-dealers that are small
entities. The purpose of proposed Rule 15c6-2 is to achieve trade date completion of
institutional trade allocations, confirmations, and affirmations to facilitate a T+1 standard
settlement cycle. Alternatives, such as different compliance requirements or timetables, or
exemptions, for Rule 15c6-2, or any part thereof, for small entities would undermine the purpose
of establishing a standard settlement cycle. For example, allowing small entities to complete the
allocation, confirmation, and affirmation processes at a time later than trade date could create a
two-tiered market that could work to the detriment of small entities whose post-trade processing
would not coincide with that of other firms operating on a T+1 settlement cycle. Additionally,
239
the Commission believes that establishing a single timetable (i.e., compliance date) for all
broker-dealers, including small entities, to comply with the new rule is necessary to ensure that
the transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle takes place in an orderly manner that minimizes
undue disruptions in the securities markets. With respect to using performance rather than
design standards, the Commission used performance standards to the extent appropriate under
the statute. Under the proposed rule, broker-dealers have the flexibility to tailor their systems
and processes, and generally to choose how, to comply with the new rule.
The Commission considered alternatives to the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 that
would accomplish the stated objectives of the amendment without disproportionately burdening
investment advisers that are small entities, including: differing compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities;
clarifying, consolidating or simplifying the compliance and reporting requirements; using
performance rather than design standards; or providing an exemption from coverage of all or part
of the proposed rule for investment advisers that are small entities. Regarding the first and
fourth alternatives, the Commission believes that establishing different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables for small advisers, or exempting small advisers from the proposed
rule, or any part thereof, would be inappropriate under these circumstances. Because the
protections of the Advisers Act are intended to apply equally to clients of both large and small
firms, it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Advisers Act to specify differences for
small entities under the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2. While it is the staff’s experience
that some small and mid-size advisers do not currently retain these records – whereas most larger
advisers already retain them – the Commission believes that the initial burden on small advisers
240
of retaining the proposed records would not be large.455 As discussed above, the Commission
believes these advisers would need to update their policies and procedures and instruct personnel
to retain these records in their electronic recordkeeping systems, including any confirmations
that they may have retained in paper format. However, because the Commission believes these
advisers already have recordkeeping systems to accommodate these records (which would
include, at a minimum, existing spreadsheet formats and email retention systems), the
Commission does not believe the two hour additional burden of complying with this proposed
amendment would warrant establishing a different timetable for compliance for small advisers.
In addition, as discussed above, our staff would use the information that advisers would maintain
to help prepare for examinations of investment advisers and verify that an adviser has completed
the steps necessary to complete settlement in a timely manner in accordance with proposed rule
15c6-1(a). Establishing different conditions for large and small advisers would negate these
benefits. Regarding the second alternative, we believe the current proposal is clear and that
further clarification, consolidation, or simplification of the compliance requirements is not
necessary. Our proposal states the types of communications – confirmations, any allocations,
and affirmations – that advisers must retain in their records, and that allocations (if applicable)
and affirmations must be date and time stamped. We believe that by proposing to clearly list
these types of communications as required records, advisers will not need to parse whether, and
if so which, current requirement under Rule 204-2 captures these post-trade communications.
Further, the proposed requirement to date and time stamp the allocations (if applicable) and
 455 See supra Part III.C.
241
affirmations sent to a broker or dealer is clear and consistent with many advisers’ current
practices of date and time stamping these records, as discussed in Part VI.A, above.
456
Regarding the third alternative, the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2 is narrowly tailored to
correspond to the proposed rules and rule amendments under the Exchange Act, and using
performance rather than design standards would be inconsistent with our statutory mandate to
protect investors, as advisers must maintain books and records in a uniform and quantifiable
manner that it is useful to our regulatory and examination program.
7. Request for Comment
The Commission encourages written comments on matters discussed in the initial RFA.
In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the number of small entities that would be
affected by the proposed amendments to Rule 15c6-1, proposed Rule 15c6-2, and the proposed
amendment to Rule 204-2, and whether the effect(s) on small entities would be economically
significant. Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any effect(s) the proposed
amendments to Rule 15c6-1, proposed Rule 15c6-2, and the proposed amendment to Rule 204-2
may have on small entities, and to provide empirical data to support their views.
B. Proposed Rule 17Ad-27
Proposed Rule 17Ad-27 would apply to clearing agencies that are CMSPs. For the
purposes of Commission rulemaking, a small entity includes, when used with reference to a
clearing agency, a clearing agency that (i) compared, cleared, and settled less than $500 million
 456 As noted above, however, we estimate that 50% of small and mid-sized advisers that
have institutional clients do not currently maintain these records, and 1% of advisers that have
institutional clients, do not send allocations or affirmations electronically to brokers or dealers.
242
in securities transactions during the preceding fiscal year, (ii) had less than $200 million of funds
and securities in its custody or control at all times during the preceding fiscal year (or at any time
that it has been in business, if shorter), and (iii) is not affiliated with any person (other than a
natural person) that is not a small business or small organization.457
Based on the Commission’s existing information about the CMSPs that would be subject
to Rule 17Ad-27, the Commission believes that all such CMSPs would not fall within the
definition of a small entity described above.458 While other CMSPs may emerge and seek to
register as clearing agencies or obtain exemptions from registration as a clearing agency with the
Commission, the Commission does not believe that any such entities would be “small entities” as
defined in 17 CFR 240.0-10(d). Accordingly, the Commission believes that any such CMSP
would exceed the thresholds for “small entities” set forth in in 17 CFR 240.0-10.
For the reasons described above, the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed
Rule 17Ad–27 would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities and requests comment on this analysis.
Statutory Authority and Text of the Proposed Rules and Rule Amendments
The Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 15c6-1, new Rule 15c6-2, and new
Rule 17Ad-27 under the Commission’s rulemaking authority set forth in Sections 15(c)(6), 17A

5. Amend § 240.15c6-1 by reserving paragraph (c) and revising paragraphs (a), (b), and
(d) to read as follows:
§ 240.15c6-1 Settlement cycle.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, a broker or dealer shall
not effect or enter into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted
security, a government security, a municipal security, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or
commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the first
business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at
the time of the transaction.
245
(b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to contracts:
(1) For the purchase or sale of limited partnership interests that are not listed on an
exchange or for which quotations are not disseminated through an automated quotation system of
a registered securities association;
(2) For the purchase or sale of securities that the Commission may from time to time,
taking into account then existing market practices, exempt by order from the requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the
Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the
protection of investors.
(c) Reserved.
(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the parties to a contract shall be deemed
to have expressly agreed to an alternate date for payment of funds and delivery of securities at
the time of the transaction for a contract for the sale for cash of securities pursuant to a firm
commitment offering if the managing underwriter and the issuer have agreed to such date for all
securities sold pursuant to such offering and the parties to the contract have not expressly agreed

affirmation process, no broker or dealer shall effect or enter into a contract for the purchase or
sale of a security (other than an exempted security, a government security, a municipal security,
commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) on behalf of a customer unless
such broker or dealer has entered into a written agreement with the customer that requires the
246
allocation, confirmation, affirmation, or any combination thereof, be completed as soon as
technologically practicable and no later than the end of the day on trade date in such form as may
be necessary to achieve settlement in compliance with paragraph (a) of § 240.15c6-1.
7. Add § 240.17Ad-27 to read as follows:
§ 240.17Ad-27 Straight-through processing by central matching service providers.
