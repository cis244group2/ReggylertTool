SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is proposing the following new
rules under the Exchange Act: (1) 17 CFR 3a5-4 (Rule 3a5-4) and (2) 17 CFR 3a44-2 (Rule
3a44-2) (collectively, the “Proposed Rules”).
I. Introduction
Advancements in electronic trading across securities markets have led to the emergence
of certain market participants that play an increasingly significant liquidity providing role in
overall trading and market activity—a role that has traditionally been performed by entities
regulated as dealers.
1 However, these market participants—despite engaging in liquidity
providing activities similar to those traditionally performed by either “dealers” or “government
securities dealers” as defined under Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the Exchange Act,
respectively, and despite their significant share of market volume2
—may not be registered with

Treasury Market Structure, 81 FR 3928 (Jan. 22, 2016) (“Treasury Request for
Comment”). See also Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014
(July 13, 2015) (“2015 Joint Staff Report”), prepared by staff of the U.S. Department of

of New York, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, available at https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/specialstudies/treasury-market-volatility-10-14-2014-joint-report.pdf. The 2015 Joint Staff

from “a market structure with primarily manual trading to a market structure with
primarily automated trading”).
2 FEDS Notes, “Principal Trading Firm Activity in Treasury Cash Markets,” James Collin
Harkrader and Michael Puglia (Aug. 4, 2020) (“[Principal trading firms] dominate
activity on the electronic [interdealer broker] platforms (61 [percent].”). For purposes of
4
the Commission as either dealers or government securities dealers under Sections 15 and 15C of
the Exchange Act, respectively.
3
 Because of this, investors and the markets lack the important
protections that result from an entity’s registration and regulation under the Exchange Act. In
addition, obligations and regulatory oversight that promote market stability and investor
protection are not being consistently applied to entities engaged in similar activities.
The Commission believes that the identification and registration of these market
participants as dealers, including those that are not currently regulated as dealers, would provide
regulators with a more comprehensive view of the markets through regulatory oversight and
would enhance market stability and investor protection.
4
 Accordingly, the Commission is
proposing to further define what it means to be buying and selling securities “as a part of a
regular business” within the definitions of “dealer” and “government securities dealer” under
Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44), respectively.
Evolution of the Market
Advancements in technology have affected securities trading across markets and asset
classes; however, regulation has not always kept pace. This is especially true in the U.S.
Treasury market in view of the increasingly significant role played by market intermediaries that
are not registered as dealers. The U.S. Treasury market has evolved significantly over recent
decades in at least two important ways. First, the amount of U.S. Treasury securities outstanding

this release, the terms “principal trading firms” and “proprietary trading firms”
(collectively, “PTFs”) will be used interchangeably.
3 As used in this release, the term “dealer” refers to both dealers and government securities
dealers unless explicitly noted or the context indicates otherwise.
4 As discussed in Section V below, the Commission believes that the Proposed Rules
would support orderly markets and protect investors by addressing negative externalities
that may arise in relation to market participants’ financial and operational risks.
5
has increased substantially.
5 At the end of 2007, Treasury debt held by the public totaled $5.1
trillion, or 35 percent of that year’s gross domestic product (“GDP”).
6 That number rose to
$23.1 trillion, or 96.5 percent of GDP, by the end of 2021.
7

Second, a significant rise in electronic trading in the interdealer market8 for U.S.
Treasury securities has contributed to a dramatic change in the overall structure of the market. In
particular, technological advances have increasingly enabled certain market participants that are
not registered as dealers to perform critical market functions, including liquidity provision, that
once were primarily performed by regulated dealers.9
 Since the mid-2000s, electronic trading

8 The U.S. Treasury market is comprised of the cash market (purchases and sales of
securities), the repo market, and the futures market. The U.S. Treasury cash market has
been traditionally bifurcated between the interdealer market (whereby dealers trade with
other dealers or with proprietary trading firms) and the dealer-to-customer market
(whereby dealers trade with clients). Trading in electronic interdealer markets occurs
anonymously on electronic trading platforms known as interdealer broker platforms
(“IDBs”). Trading on the IDB platforms is similar to trading on other highly liquid
markets and where certain market participants account for a significant trading volume.
See Treasury Request for Comment at 3928. For purposes of this release, when
discussing the U.S. Treasury market, we will be primarily focused on trading activities
occurring in the interdealer market.

register with the Commission as a dealer. See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(5)(C)(i)(II)
(providing an exception from dealer status when a bank buys or sells exempted securities,
which are defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(12)(A) to include government
securities); see also Exchange Act Section 3(a)(6) (definition of “bank”). As discussed

has come to dominate the interdealer market for U.S. Treasury securities, gradually supplanting
manual transactions made via the telephone.
10 The proliferation of fully electronic trading
venues has been accompanied by the rise of certain market participants who are not registered as
dealers and who today account for a majority of trading in the Treasury interdealer market.
11 In
particular, PTFs—businesses that often employ automated, algorithmic trading strategies
(including passive market making, arbitrage, and structural and directional trading)12 that rely on

register under Section 15C. As such, it would not register with the Commission but
instead would provide written notice of its government securities dealer status with the
appropriate Federal banking regulator, and comply with rules adopted by the Treasury
and the applicable Federal banking regulator.

Comment (“Trading on these platforms [in the Treasury cash market] has become
increasingly automated, with transactions conducted using algorithmic and other trading
strategies involving little or no human intervention . . . bear[ing] some resemblance to

PTFs and dealers transact in automated fashion, sometimes in large volumes and at high
speed.”); FEDS Notes, “Principal Trading Firm Activity in Treasury Cash Markets,”
James Collin Harkrader and Michael Puglia (Aug. 4, 2020); G30 Report at 1. The
Commission separately has proposed, among other things, amendments to Exchange Act
Rule 3b-16 to include within the definition of “exchange” systems that offer the use of
non-firm trading interest and communication protocols to bring together buyers and
sellers of securities. See Amendments regarding the Definition of “Exchange” and
Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) that Trade U.S. Treasury and Agency Securities,
National Market System (NMS) Stocks, and Other Securities, Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 94062 (Jan. 26, 2022), 87 FR 15496 (Mar. 18, 2022) (“2022 ATS Proposing
Release”).
12 See Staff Report on Algorithmic Trading in U.S. Capital Markets As Required by
Section 502 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of
2018 (Aug. 5, 2020) (“Algorithmic Trading Staff Report”), at pp. 39-41 (“Passive
market-making involves submitting non-marketable orders on both sides (buy or ‘bid,’
and sell or ‘offer’) of the marketplace”; “structural strategies attempt to exploit structural

speed, which allows them to quickly execute trades, or cancel or modify quotes in response to
perceived market events13—account for about half of the daily volume in the interdealer
market.
14
These new market participants have established themselves as significant market
intermediaries—and critical sources of liquidity—in the U.S. Treasury market. For example, by
2014, unregistered market participants trading U.S. Treasury securities, including PTFs,
accounted for a majority of trading activity in the electronic interdealer market.15 The 2015 Joint
Staff Report on the U.S. Treasury market found that more than 50 percent of trading volume in
benchmark U.S. Treasury securities on the major trading platforms is attributable to PTFs.
16 In
2020, staff at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve published a paper estimating that
PTFs account for 61 percent of the trading activity on interdealer broker platforms.17 The
significant presence of market participants that are not registered as dealers or government
securities dealers in the U.S. Treasury market, the volume of their trading, the magnitude of their

vulnerabilities in the market or in certain market participants”; and “directional strategies
generally involve establishing a short-term long or short position in anticipation of a price
move up or down”); see also 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release.

impact on the market, the regularity of their participation, and in many cases the nature of their
electronic trading strategies have all contributed to the increasingly central role of these market
participants as liquidity providers.18
The rise of electronic trading has similarly impacted the market structure of the securities
markets generally. In the equity markets, for example, trading in exchange-listed equities, once
concentrated on exchange floors, now largely occurs in an electronic, highly decentralized but
interconnected market that is accessed by brokers, dealers, and other market participants using a
large number and great variety of trading venues.19 In the equity markets, too, technological
advances have enabled significant market participants to take on an increasingly central role as
liquidity providers, largely replacing more traditional types of traditional liquidity providers,
such as exchange specialists on manual trading floors and over-the-counter (“OTC”) market
makers.
20 Technological advancements have prompted changes to trading practices, particularly
with regard to the way in which orders are generated, routed, and executed. Developments in
securities regulation also have contributed to the evolution of market structure and the rise of
electronic trading.21 These technological and regulatory changes have resulted in the
 18 2015 Joint Staff Report; Enhancing Liquidity at 6.
19 See 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release at 3594.
20 See 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release at 3607 (stating that liquidity
providers historically have been viewed as dealers, and that “[a]lthough [PTFs] that
employ passive market making strategies are a new type of market participant, the
liquidity providing function they perform is not new.”).
21 In 2005, the Commission adopted 17 CFR 242.600 through 242.614 (Regulation NMS), a
series of initiatives designed to modernize and strengthen the national market system for
equity securities through improved fairness in price execution, displaying of quotes, and
access to market data. Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005), 70 FR 37495
(“Regulation NMS Release”). As these initiatives were implemented, regulations that
had protected the manual quotes of floor exchanges from trade-throughs were rescinded.
Id. In 2006, after decades of trading predominantly on the exchange floor, the New York

development of highly automated exchange systems and trading tools that have facilitated a
business model for certain market participants, including PTFs, that perform functions similar to
registered dealers.
22
As discussed below, the Commission has long identified liquidity provision, including
acting as a “market maker” or “a de facto market maker whereby market professionals or the
public look to the firm for liquidity,” as a factor that indicates “dealer” status.23 Analysis
indicates a number of market participants that, despite their significant share of market volume
and their central role as liquidity providing intermediaries in the U.S. Treasury market, are not
registered with the Commission either as “government securities dealers” under Section 15C of
the Exchange Act or “dealers” under Section 15 of the Exchange Act.
24 This has resulted in an

Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) introduced a hybrid market structure that incorporated an
ability to transact electronically. See 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release.
Today, electronic trading dominates transactions in equity securities.
22 A significant portion of trading activity in the equity markets—once estimated at 40-50
percent of the daily trading volume in exchange-listed equities—is conducted by PTFs.

(Nov. 5, 2002) (“2002 Release”) (stating that a person generally may satisfy the
definition, and therefore, be acting as a dealer in the securities markets by conducting
various activities, including “acting as a market maker or specialist on an organized
exchange or trading system”).
24 See Section V.B.2.a, Table 1. Section 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act defines the term
10
uneven playing field in which some participants are subject to regulation (and its attendant costs
and benefits), and some are not. This uneven application of regulatory oversight of significant
liquidity providers makes it difficult for regulators and market observers to detect, investigate,
understand, or address market events, such as the “flash rally” in October 2014.
As discussed below, the regulatory regime applicable to dealers is a cornerstone of the
U.S. Federal securities laws, and helps to promote the Commission’s long-standing mission to
protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and promote capital formation.
As discussed in Sections II.D, and V.C, the registration of market participants who engage in
significant dealer-like activities—but who are not currently registered as dealers—would provide
regulators with a more comprehensive view of the markets through regulatory oversight, as well
as enhance market stability through compliance with dealer regulations that are designed to
support orderly markets, and protect investors by minimizing the impact of market participants’
potential financial and operational risks.
25 Accordingly, the Commission is taking steps to
ensure that these market participants are registered and regulated,
26 and is proposing for

“dealer” to mean “any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities . . .
for such person’s own account through a broker or otherwise,” but excludes “a person
that buys or sells securities . . . for such person’s own account, either individually or in a
fiduciary capacity, but not as a part of a regular business.” Similarly, Section 3(a)(44) of
the Exchange Act, provides, in relevant part, that the term “government securities dealer”
means “any person engaged in the business of buying and selling government securities
for his own account, through a broker or otherwise,” but “does not include any person
insofar as he buys or sells such securities for his own account, either individually or in
some fiduciary capacity, but not as part of a regular business.” See Section II.A.
25 Section V.C.2 describes the estimated costs associated with registering as a dealer or
government securities dealer for those persons who meet the proposed standards.
26 In addition, earlier this year, the Commission proposed to amend 17 CFR 242.300
through 242.304 (Regulation ATS) for alternative trading systems (“ATSs”) that trade
government securities (as defined under Section 3(a)(42) of the Exchange Act) or
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements on government securities (“repos”) (such
ATSs, together, “Government Securities ATSs”) to: (1) eliminate the current exemption
11
comment rules to further define the regulatory status of certain participants as “dealers” and
“government securities dealers,” within the meaning of Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the
Exchange Act, respectively.27
Specifically, the Commission is proposing standards to identify those market participants
that are providing an important liquidity provision function in today’s securities markets. Any
person28 that meets the activity-based standards identified in the Proposed Rules would be a
dealer or government securities dealer required to register, absent an otherwise available and
applicable statutory or regulatory exemption or exception (e.g., foreign broker-dealers exempted
pursuant to 17 CFR 240.15a- 6 (Exchange Act Rule 15a-6)).29

from compliance with Regulation ATS for an ATS that limits its securities activities to
government securities or repos, and registers as a broker-dealer or is a bank; (2) require
the filing of public Form ATS-N for Government Securities ATSs, which would be
subject to Commission review and ineffectiveness procedures, and would require a
Government Securities ATS to disclose information about its manner of operations and
the ATS-related activities of the registered broker-dealer or government securities broker
or government securities dealer that operates the ATS and its affiliates; and (3) apply the
fair access rule under 17 CFR 242.301(b)(5) (Rule 301(b)(5) of Regulation ATS) to
Government Securities ATSs that meet certain volume thresholds in U.S. Treasury
Securities or in a debt security issued or guaranteed by a U.S. executive agency, or
government-sponsored enterprise (“Agency Securities”). See 2022 ATS Proposing
Release. The 2022 ATS Proposing Release is also re-proposing amendments to 12 CFR
242.1000 through 242.1007 (Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (“Regulation
SCI”)) to apply it to Government Securities ATSs that meet certain volume thresholds in
U.S. Treasury Securities or Agency Securities.
27 We have consulted with the staff of the U.S. Department of the Treasury on this proposal.
28 As discussed more fully below, the standards in the Proposed Rules do not apply to a
person that has or controls total assets of less than $50 million, or an investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”)
(such company a “registered investment company”). See proposed Rule 3a5-4(a)(2) and
proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(3). Investment advisers are not required to aggregate accounts
held in the name of clients of the adviser under certain circumstances as described in
proposed Rule 3a5-4(b)(2)(ii) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(b)(2)(ii). See Section III.D.
29 There is an analogous exemption under the Treasury rules for certain foreign government
securities dealers. See 17 CFR 401.7 (Treas. Reg. § 401.7) (1987) (“Exemption for
12
As the Proposed Rules focus on activity rather than label or status, they would potentially
scope in other market participants as discussed below in Section V, thereby triggering a
registration requirement and subjecting those entities to dealer regulation and oversight. As
discussed further in Section V.B.2, the Commission’s analysis indicates that the Proposed Rules
would primarily require registration by PTFs, and potentially some private funds.
30 In addition,
it is possible that the activities of some investment advisers31 could meet the Proposed Rules32
and trigger a dealer registration requirement. The Commission believes the scope of the
Proposed Rules is appropriate in light of the important liquidity that these participants provide to
the securities markets, which is similar to that historically provided by regulated dealers.
The Commission is proposing to exclude certain smaller participants, as well as
registered investment companies, from the ambit of the Proposed Rules. As discussed in

certain foreign government securities brokers or dealers.”). The Commission is not
expressing any views concerning multilateral development banks, like the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (or the World Bank) and the International
Finance Corporation, or foreign sovereigns or foreign central banks, or any other
sovereign or international bodies as to the immunities such entities may possess under
U.S. or international law. See, e.g., Security-Based Swap Transactions Connected With a
Non-U.S. Person’s Dealing Activity That Are Arranged, Negotiated, or Executed by
Personnel Located in a U.S. Branch or Office or in a U.S. Branch or Office of an Agent;

30 A private fund, including a hedge fund, is an issuer that would be an investment company
as defined in Section 3 of the Investment Company Act if not for Section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-3.
31 “Investment adviser” is defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers
Act”) as “any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others,
either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the
advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, or who, for compensation
and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning
securities.” See 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11).
32 See Section III.D.
13
Section III.A and V.B, these smaller participants—persons that have or control less than $50
million in total assets—are unlikely to be able to engage in the significant liquidity provision that
is the focus of the Proposed Rules. As discussed below in Section III.A, in light of the
regulatory structure that governs registered investment companies, which addresses, among other
things, the types of concerns that we seek to address in the Proposed Rules, the Commission is
proposing to exclude registered investment companies from the Proposed Rules.33
Conversely, the Proposed Rules would not exclude private funds because we are
proposing to take a similar approach to regulating dealer activity across market participants and,
unlike registered investment companies, private funds are not subject to the regulatory
framework of the Investment Company Act. The Commission currently receives information
about the operations, exposures, liabilities, liquidity, and strategies of private funds through
filings of Form PF by registered private fund advisers and has recently proposed amendments to
Form PF to enhance the reporting about private funds.
34 If excluded from the Proposed Rules,
however, private funds engaged in dealer activity would not be subject to the dealer regulatory
regime, which includes not only registration obligations, but also comprehensive regulatory
requirements and oversight that broadly focus on market functionality—that is, the impact of
dealing activity on the market as a whole.
The Proposed Rules also would not exclude investment advisers registered under the
Advisers Act (“registered investment advisers”). A registered investment adviser trading for its
 33 As discussed in Section III.D, for purposes of the definition of “own account,” an account
held in the name of a person that is a registered investment company would not be
attributed to a controlling person or another person under common control.

own proprietary account, for example, could trigger the dealer registration requirements under
the Proposed Rules. And, under certain circumstances, a registered investment adviser could
trigger application of the Proposed Rules because of aggregating trading in its own account with
client accounts it controls. However, as described below in Section III.D, in determining
whether its activity would be captured by the Proposed Rules, a registered investment adviser
would not be required to aggregate its own trading activities with the trading activities of its
clients’ solely based on an adviser-client discretionary investment management relationship.
35
This exclusion is designed to attribute the dealer activity to the appropriate market actor.
II. Background
The Federal securities laws provide a comprehensive system of regulation of securities
activities, and the definition of dealer is one of the Exchange Act’s most important definitions.
As discussed below, the statutory definition of “dealer” in Section 3(a)(4) and the accompanying
registration requirements of the Exchange Act were drawn broadly by Congress in 1934 to
encompass a wide range of activities involving the securities markets and their participants.36
Registered dealers and government securities dealers are subject to a panoply of regulatory
obligations and supervisory oversight intended to protect investors and the securities markets.
Therefore, it is important that market participants whose securities activities fall within the broad
 35 Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of the Proposed Rules would not attribute to a registered
investment adviser an account held in the name of a client of the registered investment
adviser, unless the adviser controls the client as a result of the adviser’s right to vote or
direct the vote of voting securities of the client, the adviser’s right to sell or direct the sale
of voting securities of the client, or the adviser’s capital contributions to or rights to
amounts upon dissolution of the client.
36 Proposed Rule 3a5-4 would apply to securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the
Exchange Act, and proposed Rule 3a44-2 would apply to government securities as
defined by Section 3(a)(42) of the Exchange Act, including any digital asset that is a
security or a government security within the meaning of the Exchange Act.
15
definitions of “dealer” and “government securities dealer” are registered and regulated under the
Exchange Act.
A. Definitions of “Dealer” and “Government Securities Dealer”
Section 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act defines the term “dealer” to mean “any person37
engaged in the business of buying and selling securities . . . for such person’s own account
through a broker or otherwise,” but excludes “a person that buys or sells securities … for such
person’s own account, either individually or in a fiduciary capacity, but not as a part of a regular
business.”38 This statutory exclusion from the definition of “dealer” is often referred to as the
“trader” exception.39 As one commentator has described it, at the core of the “dealer/trader”
distinction is an attempt to draw a line between a dealer and “an ordinary investor who buys and
sells for his own account with some frequency.”40 Read together, these provisions identify as a
 37 Paragraph (b)(1) of the Proposed Rules provides that the term “person” has the same
meaning as prescribed in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act. Section 3(a)(9) of the
Exchange Act defines a “person” as “a natural person, company, government, or political
subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of a government.” See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(9).
38 See Sections 3(a)(5)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5)(A) and (B).
The definition of “dealer” in the Exchange Act is largely unchanged from its enactment
in 1934. Until the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) was enacted in 1999, banks were
excluded from the definition of “dealer.” The GLBA added Section 3(a)(5)(C) of the
Exchange Act to create a series of functional exemptions from the statutory definition of
dealer. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(“Dodd-Frank Act”) further amended Section 3(a)(5)(A) of the Exchange Act to exclude
from the dealer definition persons engaged in the business of buying and selling securitybased swaps, other than security-based swaps with or for persons that are not eligible
contract participants.
39 See, e.g., 2002 Release (explaining that “a person that is buying securities for its own
account may still not be a ‘dealer’ because it is not ‘engaged in the business’ of buying
and selling securities for its own account as part of a regular business,” and that “[t]his
exclusion is often referred to as the dealer/trader distinction”).
40 See Loss, Securities Regulation 722 (1st ed. 1951) (“One aspect of the ‘business’ concept
is the matter of drawing the line between a ‘dealer’ and a trader—an ordinary investor
who buys and sells for his own account with some frequency.”), cited in Further
16
“dealer” a person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account as
part of a regular business. Absent an exception or an exemption, Section 15(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act makes it unlawful for a “dealer” to effect any transactions in, or to induce or
attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security unless registered with the Commission in
accordance with Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
Similarly, Section 3(a)(44) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant part, that the term
“government securities dealer” means “any person engaged in the business of buying and selling
government securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise,” but “does not include
any person insofar as he buys or sells such securities for his own account, either individually or
in some fiduciary capacity, but not as part of a regular business.”41 Read together, these

41 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(44). Congress added the definition of “government securities dealer” to
the Exchange Act in the Government Securities Act of 1986. Pub. L. 99-571, 100 Stat.
3208 (Oct. 28, 1986). To the extent a financial institution is a government securities
dealer required to register under Section 15C, it would not register with the Commission
but instead would provide written notice of its government securities dealer status with
the appropriate Federal banking regulator, and comply with rules adopted by the Treasury
and the applicable Federal banking regulator. See Regulations under Section 15C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 17 CFR 400.1(b), available at CFR-2018-title17-vol4-
chapIV.pdf (treasurydirect.gov) (the “Treasury Rules”). The Treasury Rules address
financial responsibility, protecting customer securities and funds, recordkeeping, large
position reporting, and financial reporting and audits. Also included are rules concerning
custodial holdings of government securities by depository institutions. The Commission
retains broad antifraud authority over banks that are government securities dealers. Soon
after enactment of the Government Securities Act of 1986, the staff issued a series of noaction letters to persons seeking assurances that the staff would not recommend
enforcement action if they did not register as government securities dealers. See, e.g.,
Bankers Guarantee Title & Trust Co., SEC No-Action Letter (Jan. 22, 1991); Bank of
America, Canada, SEC No-Action Letter (May 1, 1988); Citicorp Homeowners, Inc.,
SEC No-Action Letter (Oct. 7, 1987); Fairfield Trading Corp., SEC No-Action Letter
(Dec. 10, 1987); Continental Grain Co., SEC No-Action Letter (Nov. 28, 1987); Louis

provisions identify as a “government securities dealer” a person engaged in the business of
buying and selling government securities for its own account as part of a regular business.42
Section 15C of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for a “government securities dealer” (other
than a registered broker-dealer or financial institution) to induce or attempt to induce the
purchase or sale of any government security unless such government securities dealer is
registered in accordance with Section 15C(a)(2).43
Under both the dealer and government securities dealer definitions, a person acts as a
dealer or a government securities dealer when it is engaged in the business of buying and selling
securities or government securities, respectively, for its own account as part of a “regular
business.”44

Dreyfus Corp., SEC No-Action Letter (July 23, 1987); United Savings Association of
Texas, SEC No-Action Letter (Apr. 2, 1987). Staff no-action letters, like all staff
statements, have no legal force or effect: they do not alter or amend applicable law, and
they create no new or additional obligations for any person. Upon the adoption of any
final rule, some letters and other staff statements, or portions thereof, may be moot,
superseded, or otherwise inconsistent with the final rules and, therefore, would be
withdrawn or modified.
42 The legislative history relating to the enactment of the Government Securities Act of
1986 provides that the term government securities dealer “would utilize key concepts
from the current definitions of . . . ‘dealer’ and ‘municipal securities dealer.’” H.R. Rep.
No. 258, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 24 (1985). S. Rep. No. 426, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1986).
43 A government securities dealer that is a registered dealer or a financial institution must
file notice with the appropriate regulatory agency that it is a government securities dealer.
See 15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a). Exchange Act Section 3(a)(46) defines the term “financial
institution” to include: (i) a bank (as that term is defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(6)
(15 U.S.C. 38c(a)(6)); (ii) a foreign bank (as that term is used in the International
Banking Act of 1978); and (iii) a savings association (as defined in section 3(b) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation). See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(46)(A) through(C).
44 Unless otherwise indicated, references to “dealer” activity apply both with respect to
“dealers” and “government securities dealers” under Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the
Exchange Act, respectively.

Factors Considered in Evaluating “Regular Business”
Because the Exchange Act does not define what it means to be engaged in a “regular
business,” courts and the Commission have looked to an array of factors in determining whether
someone is a “dealer” within the meaning of the statute.45 In determining whether a person is
engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account as part of a “regular
business,” courts and the Commission assess the frequency with which the person buys and sells
securities for its own account.46 The “regularity” of participation in securities transactions
 45 See, e.g., Registration Requirements for Foreign Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release
No. 27017 (July 11, 1989), 54 FR 30013, 30015 (July.. 18, 1989) (stating that the
definition of “dealer” and the registration requirements under the Exchange Act “were
broadly drawn by Congress to encompass a wide range of activities involving investors
and the securities markets”). Recognizing that the word “business” is central to the
dealer definition, courts have cited to Black’s Law Dictionary definition of business: “a
commercial enterprise carried on for profit, a particular occupation or employment
habitually engaged in for livelihood or gain.” SEC v. Justin W. Keener d/b/a JMJ
Financial, No. 20-cv-21254, pp. 14-15 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 21, 2022) (citing SEC v. Big Apple
Consulting USA, Inc., 783 F.3d 786, 809 (11th Cir. 2015) which was quoting Black’s Law
Dictionary 239 (10th ed. 2009)) (emphasis in original). The Eleventh Circuit elaborated
that “[c]entral to this definition is profit or gain.” Id. (emphasis in original). See also

Supp. 411, 415 (D. Mass.), aff’d, 545 F.2d 754 (1st Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 904
(1977) (noting that the dealer definition: “connote[s] a certain regularity of participation
in securities transactions at key points in the chain of distribution.”); see also Eastside
Church of Christ v. National Plan, Inc., 391 F.2d at 361-362 (an entity that purchased
many securities for its own account as part of its regular business and sold some of them
was deemed a dealer); SEC v. Century Inv. Transfer Corp., 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
11364, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 1971) (a limited partnership that bought and sold
securities for its own account on numerous occasions was deemed a dealer); SEC v.

28, 2003) (an unregistered stock promotion company that was operating as a broker was
also operating as a dealer because it bought securities on more than a dozen occasions
and sold those securities in hundreds of transactions through accounts it maintained or in
which it had an interest).
19
necessary to find that a person is a “dealer” has not been quantified, but involves engaging in
“more than a few isolated” securities transactions.47
In addition to frequency of activity, the nature of the trading activity is a factor in
determining whether a person is a dealer.48 Over time, the Commission has identified activities
that, in context and when engaged in with regularity, may be indicative of being a dealer.49 For
example, the Commission has identified certain factors that would be indicators of dealer
activity, including, among other things: (1) acting as a market maker or specialist on an
organized exchange or trading system; (2) acting as a de facto market maker or liquidity
provider;50 and (3) holding oneself out as buying or selling securities at a regular place of
business.51

49 See Entities Adopting Release, 77 FR 30617 (discussing application of the dealer/trader
distinction in the context of security-based swap dealers); see also 2002 Release at
67499.
50 For example, a person may be acting as a dealer if they “turned a profit not from selling
only after market prices increased (like a trader), but rather from quickly reselling at a
marked-up price.” River North, 415 F. Supp. 3d at 859; see also SEC v. Big Apple
Consulting USA, Inc., 783 F.3d 786, 809-10 (11th Cir. 2015); In re Sodorff, 50 S.E.C.
1249, 1992 WL 224082, at *5 (Sep. 2, 1992).
51 See 2002 Release. These factors were confirmed by the Commission in 2012 when it
defined certain terms, including “security-based swap dealer,” in accordance with Title
VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. See Entities Adopting Release at 30607 (distinguishing
traders from dealers by noting that a trader, among other things, does not make a market).
These indicia have been developed in a range of contexts over time as the markets and
dealer activity have evolved, and do not represent an exclusive or exhaustive list of
activities relevant for determining whether registration as a dealer is required. Further, a
person not meeting the standards in the Proposed Rules may still be a dealer under
otherwise applicable dealer precedent. Whether or not a person is a “dealer” is based on
the facts and circumstances, where various factors are “neither exclusive, nor function as
a checklist,” and meeting any one factor may be sufficient to establish dealer status. SEC
v. River North Equity LLC, 415 F. Supp. 3d 853, 858 (N.D. Ill. 2019); accord SEC v.
20
Trader Exclusion
The Exchange Act excludes from the definition of dealer any “person that buys or sells
securities . . . for such person’s own account, either individually or in a fiduciary capacity, but
not as a part of a regular business.”52 While traders and dealers engage in the same core activity
—buying and selling securities for their own account—their level of activity varies in absolute
terms and in regularity.53 The Commission has stated that dealers include those who are willing
to buy and sell contemporaneously and often quickly enter into offsetting transactions to
minimize the risk associated with a position.54 In contrast, traders are “market participants who
provide capital investment and are willing to accept the risk of ownership in listed companies for
an extended period of time,” and the Commission has stated that “it makes little sense to refer to
someone as ‘investing’ in a company for a few seconds, minutes, or hours.”55 The purpose of
the “trader” exception is to “exclude from the definition of ‘dealer’ members of the public who
buy and sell securities for their own account as ordinary traders.”56

C. Department of the Treasury Request for Comment
In 2016, Treasury published notice seeking public comment on the evolution of the U.S.
Treasury market structure and the implications for market functions, trading and risk
management practices across the U.S. Treasury market, considerations with respect to more
comprehensive official sector access to U.S. Treasury market data, and the benefits and risks of
increased public disclosure of U.S. Treasury market activity.62 In that Request for Comment,
Treasury raised the issue of registration for certain market participants, including those persons
engaging in automated trading or conducting a certain volume of trading.63 Specifically,
concerning its continued monitoring of trading and risk management practices across the U.S.
Treasury market and reviewing regulatory requirements applicable to the government securities
market and its participants, Treasury requested comment on: (1) aligning standards between U.S.
securities, commodities, and derivatives markets and the U.S. Treasury cash market; (2) the
implications of a registration requirement for certain market participants, including those persons
engaging in automated trading or conducting a certain volume of trading; and (3) whether such
firms should be subject to capital requirements, examinations and supervision, conduct rules,

and/or other standards.64 A number of comment letters were submitted directly or indirectly
responding to these questions.65 Most commenters explicitly supported consistent regulatory
standards to be applied to certain market participants, including those persons engaging in
automated trading or conducting a certain volume of trading,66 with some commenters explicitly
supporting the registration of market participants that are not currently registered as dealers.

Another commenter stated that “principal trading firms have played an increasingly larger role in
offering liquidity in these markets, and have become de facto market makers.”69
D. Need for Commission Action
While the participation of these PTFs and other significant market participants that are
not registered as dealers may have positive effects, such as through increased competition, there
are risks that accompany such market participants’ trading activities and the accompanying lack
of regulatory obligations or oversight relating to such activity.
70 Among other things, scrutiny of
the U.S. Treasury market, in light of recent market disruptions,71 has identified a regulatory gap
in terms of the registration status and regulation of significant market participants in the U.S.
Treasury market. Not only does such a regulatory gap mean inconsistent oversight of market
participants performing similar functions either in the same market or across asset classes but, as
described below, the activity of significant market participants that are not registered may pose
certain risks to the markets.
In particular, certain market participants, such as PTFs that are not registered as dealers,
play an increasingly significant role as major liquidity providers across asset classes in the U.S.
securities markets, including the U.S. Treasury market. These market participants engage in a
significant volume of trading across many trading platforms for their own accounts, generally
ending the day with a relatively small position. In the U.S. Treasury market, in particular,
 69 See Letter from Stuart Kaswell, Executive Vice President and Managing Director,
General Counsel, and Jiří Krόl, Deputy CEO, Global Head of Government Affairs,
Alternative Investment Management Association (Apr. 22, 2016) at 2 (describing the
evolution of market structure generally).
70 See Section V for discussion of competition; see also Algorithmic Trading Staff Report.
71 See 2021 IAWG Report.
25
market commenters and financial regulators have stated that the rise of electronic trading and
emergence of unregulated significant market participants over the years could be a contributing
factor to the more frequent market disruptions, specifically stating that these changes are directly
affecting liquidity provision.72
The Commission believes that, although the Proposed Rules will not by themselves
necessarily prevent future market disruptions, the operation of the rules will support
transparency; market integrity and resiliency; and investor protection; across the U.S. Treasury
and other securities markets by closing the regulatory gap that currently exists and ensuring
consistent regulatory oversight of persons engaging in the type of activities described in the
Proposed Rules.73 The requirement that dealers register has been repeatedly recognized as
being “of the utmost importance in effecting the purposes of the [Exchange] Act. It is through
the registration requirement that some discipline may be exercised over those who may engage in
the securities business and by which necessary standards may be established with respect to
training, experience, and records.”74 For example, as described below in Section V.C, dealers

Trader, and comply with continuing education requirements.
75 See Sections 15(b)(8), 15C(e)(1), and 17(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8), 15
U.S.C. 78o-5(e)(1), and 15 U.S.C. 78q(b), respectively. Section 15(b)(8) of the
Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any registered broker or dealer to effect any
transaction in securities (with certain exceptions) unless the broker or dealer is a member
of a registered securities association or effects transactions in securities solely on a
national securities exchange of which it is a member. Section 15C(e)(1) of the Exchange
Act requires that a registered government securities broker-dealer, other than certain
financial institutions, become a member of a registered national securities exchange or
registered national securities association. Because government securities are not traded
on registered national securities exchanges, a person that registers as a government
securities dealer under Section 15C to trade only government securities would need to
become a member of a registered national securities association (FINRA is the only
registered national securities association). Currently, however, a person that is engaged
in a regular business of buying and selling both government securities and other
securities for its own account, and therefore registers as a dealer under Section 15, could
potentially be exempt from Section 15(b)(8)’s national securities association membership
requirement if it is or becomes a member of a national securities exchange and satisfies
other requirements. See 17 CFR 240.15b9-1. Section 17(b) of the Exchange Act
provides, among other things, that all records of a broker-dealer are subject at any time,
or from time to time, to such reasonable, periodic, special, or other examinations by
representatives of the Commission and the appropriate regulatory agency of the brokerdealer as the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.
76 See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 (Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1) (the “Net Capital Rule”;
Financial Responsibility Rules for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 70072
(July 30, 2013), 78 FR 51823 at 51849 (Aug. 21, 2013) (“The capital standard in Rule
15c3-1 is a net liquid assets test. This standard is designed to allow a broker-dealer the
flexibility to engage in activities that are part of conducting a securities business (e.g.,
taking securities into inventory) but in a manner that places the firm in the position of
holding at all times more than one dollar of highly liquid assets for each dollar of
unsubordinated liabilities (e.g., money owed to customers, counterparties, and
creditors)”). The rule imposes a “moment to moment” net capital requirement in that
broker-dealers must maintain an amount of net capital that meets or exceeds their
minimal net capital requirement at all times.

to report among other things when the member or an associated person of the members

suspended or disciplined by a specified regulatory body. The provision at 17 CFR
240.17a-5(d)(1)(i)(A) (Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(d)(1)(i)(A)) requires broker-dealers,
subject to limited exceptions, to file annual reports, including financial statements and
supporting schedules that generally must be audited by a Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB)-registered independent public accountant in accordance with
PCAOB standards.
78 See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.15c3-5 (Exchange Act Rule 15c3-5)—Risk Management Controls

integrity by reducing risks associated with market access by requiring financial and
regulatory risk management controls reasonably designed to limit financial exposures and
ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
79 See, e.g., Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and 17 CFR 240.17a-3 and 240.17a-4 (Rules
17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder); see also, e.g., FINRA Rules 2268, 4510, 4511, 4512, 4513,

rules, as well as assess whether and how a firm’s participation in the securities markets
impacted a major market event. See Staff Study on Investment Advisers and BrokerDealers As Required by Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (Jan. 2011) at 72. See also Recordkeeping and Reporting

securities dealers are required to comply with specific anti-manipulative and other anti-fraud
rules that are promulgated pursuant to Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act, thereby contributing to
fair and orderly markets.
80 Firms that are government securities dealers (including registered
broker-dealers trading government securities) must also comply with rules adopted by Treasury,
including but not limited to rules relating to financial responsibility, recordkeeping, financial

81 Under Title I of the Government Securities Act (“GSA”), all government securities
brokers and government securities dealers are required to comply with the requirements
in Treasury’s GSA regulations that are set out in 17 CFR parts 400 through 449. For the
most part, Treasury’s GSA regulations incorporate with some modifications: (1)
Commission rules for non-financial institution government securities brokers and
government securities dealers; and (2) the appropriate regulatory agency rules for
financial institutions that are required to file notice as government securities brokers and
government securities dealers. See, e.g., 17 CFR part 400, Rules of general application;
17 CFR part 401, Exemptions; 17 CFR part 402, Financial responsibility; 17 CFR part
403, Protection of customer securities and balances; 17 CFR part 404, Recordkeeping and
preservation of records; 17 CFR part 405, Reports and audit; 17 CFR part 420, Large
position reporting; and 17 CFR part 449, Forms, Section 15C of the Exchange Act. The
GSA regulations also include requirements for custodial holdings by depository
institutions at 17 CFR part 450, which were issued under Title II of the GSA. The
Treasury GSA regulations provide in many instances that a registered dealer can comply
with a Commission rule to establish compliance with the comparable Treasury
requirement. See, e.g., 17 CFR 402.1(b) (Treas. Reg. § 402.1(b)) (“This part does not
apply to a registered broker or dealer . . . that is subject to [Exchange Act Rule 15c3-
1].”); 17 CFR 403.1 (Treas. Reg. § 403.1) (regarding application to registered brokers or
dealers); 17 CFR 404.1 and 405.1(a) (Treas. Reg. §§ 404.1 and 405.1(a)) (same).

government securities dealers are subject to Commission and SRO examination, inspection, and
enforcement for compliance with applicable Federal securities laws and SRO rules.
82
III. Overview of Proposed Rules
The operative concept in the definitions of “dealer” and “government securities dealer”—
that distinguishes the regulated entity from the unregulated trader—is that the dealer is engaged
in buying and selling securities for its own account “as part of a regular business.”83 The
Commission is proposing two rules—proposed Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2—to further define these
terms to identify certain activities that would constitute a “regular business” requiring a person
engaged in those activities to register as a “dealer” or a “government securities dealer,” absent an
exception or exemption.84 A person (as defined below) who engages in any one of the activities
identified in either proposed Rule 3a5-4 or 3a44-2 would be considered a dealer under that
rule.85
 82 See Exchange Act Section 15(b) (regarding Commission authority to sanction brokers
and dealers); Section 15C(c) (regarding Commission authority to sanction government
securities dealers that are registered with it); Section 15C(d) (authorizing the Commission
to examine books and records of government securities dealers registered with it); and
Section 17(b) (broker-dealer recordkeeping and examination). See also Section 15C(g)
(restricting the ability of the Commission with respect to government securities dealers
that are not registered with the Commission).
83 As discussed above, the definitions of “dealer” and “government securities dealer” under
the Exchange Act exclude from dealer status a person that buys or sells securities for
such person’s own account “but not as a part of a regular business.” See 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(5)(A) and (B) and 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(44)(A).
84 See Exchange Act Section 15 (regarding registration of dealers) and Section 15C
(regarding registration of government securities dealers).
85 Status as a securities “dealer” or “government securities dealer” as a result of engaging in
securities or government securities transactions “as part of a regular business” under
proposed Rules 3a5-4 or 3a44-2 is not determinative of a person’s status for purposes of
the exclusions in Section 3(c)(2) of the Investment Company Act. Although that
exclusion uses some terminology that is similar to that in the Proposed Rules,
Section 3(c)(2) includes a number of conditions in addition to the requirement that a
30
As explained above, over the years the Commission and the courts have identified a
number of qualitative factors, including acting as a market maker, de facto market maker, or
liquidity provider, that might indicate a person may be engaged in a regular business of buying
and selling securities for its own account.86 The Proposed Rules would expand upon these
statements to further define three qualitative standards designed to more specifically identify
activities of certain market participants who assume dealer-like roles, specifically, persons whose
trading activity in the market “has the effect of providing liquidity” to other market
participants.87 While all market participants who buy or sell securities in the marketplace
arguably contribute to a market’s liquidity, the Proposed Rules focus on market participants who
engage in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities for their own account that has the
effect of providing liquidity. Said differently, for market participants engaging in any of the

person regularly engage in transactions on both sides of the market, each of which an
entity would have to satisfy to be able to rely on the investment company exclusion.
86 See 2002 Release (stating that a person generally may satisfy the definition, and
therefore, be acting as a dealer in the securities markets, by conducting various activities,
including “acting as a market maker or specialist on an organized exchange or trading
system” or “acting asa de facto market maker whereby market professionals or the
public look to the firm for liquidity”).
87 As noted below, the Proposed Rules are not the exclusive means of establishing that a
person is a dealer or government securities dealer—to the extent consistent with the
Proposed Rules, existing Commission interpretations and precedent will continue to
apply. See above Section II.A. For example, facts indicating a person may be acting as a
“dealer” include underwriting, as well as buying and selling directly to securities
customers together with conducting any of an assortment of professional market activities
such as providing investment recommendations, extending credit, and lending securities
in connection with transactions in securities, and carrying a securities account. See 2002
Release. See also SEC v. Justin W. Keener d/b/a JMJ Financial, No. 20-cv-21254 (S.D.
Fla. Jan. 21, 2022). Accordingly, a person may still be acting as a dealer even if they do
not, under the Proposed Rules, engage in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities
that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants. See proposed Rule
3a5-4(c) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(c), discussed below in Section III.E.
31
activities identified by the qualitative standards of the Proposed Rules, liquidity provision is not
incidental to their trading activities. Rather, these persons are “in the business” of buying and
selling securities for their own account and providing liquidity as part of a regular business.
88
The Proposed Rules would set forth three standards that the Commission believes would
appropriately distinguish and identify such liquidity provision as a “regular business.”
In addition, proposed Rule 3a44-2, which would apply only to government securities
dealers, would include a quantitative standard.
89 This quantitative standard would establish a
bright-line test, under which a person engaging in certain specified levels of activity would be
deemed to be buying and selling government securities “as a part of a regular business,”
regardless of whether it meets any of the qualitative standards.90
A person whose activity meets the quantitative or any of the qualitative standards would
be a dealer and so subject to the Exchange Act registration requirements, regardless of whether
the liquidity provision is a chosen consequence of its activities.91
To account for variations in corporate structure and ownership, the Proposed Rules
additionally would define the terms “own account” and “control.” The Proposed Rules would
define a person’s “own account” to mean, subject to certain exceptions, any account: (i) held in
 88 PTFs engaging in passive market making, for example, earn revenue primarily from the
provision of liquidity, specifically “by buying at the bid and selling at the offer and
capturing any liquidity rebates offered by trading centers to liquidity supplying orders.”
See, e.g., 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release at 3607.
89 See Section III.C.
90 See id.
91 The Proposed Rules focus on effect regardless of a person’s intention. The fact that the
provision of liquidity is a fundamental aspect of the activities captured by the qualitative
standards does not mean that such liquidity provision need be deliberate to come within
the Proposed Rules. Intent is not required by the statutory language, nor is it relevant in
every circumstance.
32
the name of that person; (ii) held in the name of a person, over whom that person exercises
control or with whom that person is under common control;
92 or (iii) held for the benefit of those
persons identified in (i) and (ii). In addition, the Proposed Rules would give “control” the “same
meaning as prescribed in § 240.13h-l (Rule 13h-l), under the Exchange Act.”
While the Proposed Rules would establish standards that identify when a person is acting
as a dealer or government securities dealer, whether a person’s activities meet these standards
would remain a facts and circumstances determination.
93 Importantly, the Proposed Rules are
not the exclusive means of establishing that a person is a dealer or government securities
dealer—to the extent consistent with the Proposed Rules, existing Commission interpretations
and precedent will continue to apply.
94
A market participant that is not registered as a dealer that comes within the scope of the
Proposed Rules would need to register with the Commission as a dealer or government securities
 92 The Proposed Rules would exclude from aggregation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii): (A) an
account in the name of a registered broker, dealer, government securities dealer, or an
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act; (B) with respect to
an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, an account held in the name of a
client of the adviser unless the adviser controls the client as a result of the adviser’s right
to vote or direct the vote of voting securities of the client, the adviser’s right to sell or
direct the sale of voting securities of the client, or the adviser’s capital contributions to or
rights to amounts upon dissolution of the client; or (C) with respect to any person, an
account in the name of another person that is under common control with that person
solely because both persons are clients of an investment adviser registered under the
Advisers Act unless those accounts constitute a parallel account structure.
93 Cf. 2002 Release (“[T]he analysis of whether a person meets the definition of a dealer
depends upon all of the relevant facts and circumstances.”).
94 See Section II.A. For example, a person generally may satisfy the statutory definition of
“dealer” by underwriting, or buying and selling directly to securities customers together
with conducting any of an assortment of professional market activities such as providing
investment recommendations, extending credit, and lending securities in connection with
transactions in securities, and carrying a securities account. See 2002 Release.
33
dealer and become a member of an SRO. This would involve filing Form BD with the
Commission and completing the SRO’s processes for new members.95 The Commission is
proposing to provide such market participants a one-year compliance period from the effective
date of any final rules. The proposed compliance period is designed to provide adequate time for
persons captured by the Proposed Rules at the time of adoption, if adopted, to apply for dealer
registration, and for the relevant SROs to conduct their review of the new member applications,
without disrupting the markets or the participants’ market activities. The proposed compliance
period would not cover market participants whose activities following the effective date of any
final rules require registration as dealers under those rules.
A. Persons Excluded from the Proposed Rules
Under the Proposed Rules, the term “person” would have the same meaning as prescribed
in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act.96 As a threshold matter, the Proposed Rules would not

34
apply to: (i) “[a] person that has or controls total assets of less than $50 million;”97 or (ii) “[an]
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.”98
As discussed above, the Proposed Rules are intended to capture market participants not
registered as dealers that serve a critical dealer-like role in the securities and government
securities markets through their liquidity provision or significant and regular trading activity in
the market. By providing an exception for persons that have or control total assets of less than
$50 million, the Proposed Rules would parallel an established standard for distinguishing
between “retail” and “institutional” investors in other contexts.
99 The Commission believes that
this threshold is appropriate in the context of the Proposed Rules because, even though a person
that has or controls less than $50 million in assets may be engaged in the activities identified in
 97 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(a)(2)(i) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(3)(i). While a person who
has or controls less than $50 million in total assets would not be subject to the Proposed
Rules, that person’s trading volume or activities may still be aggregated with those of
another person under the Proposed Rules definitions of “own account” and “control.”
See Section III.D.
98 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(a)(2)(ii) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(3)(ii).
99 Under FINRA rules, a “retail” account is distinguished from an “institutional” account by
defining, in part, an institutional account as belonging to “a person (whether a natural
person, corporation, partnership, trust, or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50
million.” FINRA Rule 4512(c)(3); see also Business Conduct Standards for SecurityBased Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants, Exchange Act Release
No. 77617 (Apr. 14, 2016), 81 FR 29959, 29995 n.462 (May 13, 2016) (adopting a
similar threshold for purposes of 17 CFR 240.15Fh-3(f)(4) (Exchange Act Rule 15Fh3(f)(4))). The Proposed Rules do not use the definition of “retail customer” adopted as
part of Regulation Best Interest, as the policy considerations behind that definition are
different than those presented here: the focus of Regulation Best Interest is the regulatory
protections provided to customers who receive recommendations from broker-dealers,
whereas the focus of this proposed rulemaking is the regulation of persons engaging in
certain dealer-like activities. See Regulation Best Interest: The Broker-Dealer Standard
of Conduct, Exchange Act Release No. 86031 (June 5, 2019), 84 FR 33318 (July 12,
2019).
35
the Proposed Rules’ qualitative standards,100 the frequency and nature of its securities trading are
less likely to pose the types of financial and operational risks to the market that may be
associated with the significant dealer-like activity engaged in by certain PTFs and other
institutional market participants, that the Proposed Rules are designed to address.
101 This is not
an exclusion from the dealer definition for all purposes. Rather, as with other persons not within
the ambit of the Proposed Rules, the question of whether a person that has or controls less than
$50 million in total assets is acting as a dealer, as opposed to a trader, will remain a facts and
circumstances determination, and to the extent consistent with the Proposed Rules, existing
applicable interpretations and precedent will continue to apply.
102
The Commission is proposing to exclude registered investment companies from the
application of the Proposed Rules.103 Registered investment companies are subject to a
 100 As discussed in Section III.C, to meet the quantitative standard set forth in proposed Rule
3a44-2(a)(2) a person must, in each of four out of the last six calendar months, engage in
buying and selling more than $25 billion of trading volume in government securities as
defined in Section 3(a)(42)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that there
will not be any instances where a person who has or controls less than $50 million in total
assets will meet this quantitative standard.
101 Depending on the scope and nature of its activities, such a person could come within the
definition of “pattern day trader” under FINRA rules. See FINRA Rule 4210. Notably,
among other requirements, a pattern day trader must maintain a minimum amount of
equity in its margin account on any day that the customer day trades and this minimum
equity must be in the account prior to engaging in any day-trading activities. Id. If the
account falls below the minimum requirement, the pattern day trader will not be
permitted to day trade until the account is restored to the minimum equity level. Id.
102 As discussed above, dealer status involves engaging in “more than a few isolated”
securities transactions. See supra note 47 and accompanying text.
103 A registered investment company includes any issuer which is or holds itself out as being
primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or
trading in securities. 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(1)(A). The Investment Company Act generally

boards of directors, among other things.
108 Moreover, registered investment companies are
subject to statutory limits on indebtedness and rules that limit leverage risk.109 In addition,
registered investment companies must adopt, implement, and review at least annually written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Federal securities laws
by the fund.

and transfer agents. See also 15 U.S.C. 80a-47(a) (“It shall be unlawful for any person,

compliance officer.111 Registered investment companies are required to register under the
Investment Company Act and offer their shares under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities
Act”).
112 They also must report to the Commission on many aspects of their operations and their
portfolio holdings.113 Registered investment companies must maintain certain books and records
and make them available for examination by the Commission.114 As a result, the Commission
has extensive oversight of registered investment companies and broad insight into their
operations and activities. In light of the regulatory structure that governs registered investment
companies, which addresses, among other things, the types of concerns that we seek to address in
the Proposed Rules, the Commission is proposing to exclude registered investment companies
from the application of the Proposed Rules.

Investment Company Act and offer their shares under the Securities Act on Forms N-1A
(open-end management investment companies), N-2 (closed-end management investment
companies), N-3 (separate accounts organized as management companies), N-4 (separate
accounts organized as unit investment trusts), N-5 (small business investment
companies), and N-6 (separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts that offer
variable life insurance products).
113 Registered investment companies report certain census information annually to the
Commission on Form N-CEN. Registered investment companies also are required to
report monthly portfolio-wide and position-level holdings data to the Commission on
Form N-PORT. This includes information regarding repurchase agreements, securities
lending activities, and counterparty exposures, terms of derivatives contracts, and discrete
portfolio level and position level risk measures to better understand fund exposure to
changes in market conditions.

115 As discussed in Section III.D, for purposes of the definition of “own account,” an account
held in the name of a person that is a registered investment company would not be
attributed to a controlling person or another person under common control.
38
The Proposed Rules would not exclude private funds because we are taking a similar
approach to regulating dealer activity across market participants and, unlike registered
investment companies, private funds are not subject to the extensive regulatory framework of the
Investment Company Act. The Commission is mindful that registered private fund advisers are
regulated under the Advisers Act and that information on private fund activities is reported by
registered private fund advisers on Form PF.
116 The information the Commission obtains on
private funds through its regulation of registered investment advisers, however, differs from that
the Commission collects for the purposes of dealer regulation. In addition, dealer registration
enhances regulatory oversight of market participants’ trading activities and interactions with the
market overall and dealer regulatory requirements focus broadly on market functionality (along
with protecting investors under principles of fair dealing between parties).
Similarly, the Proposed Rules would not apply a blanket exclusion for registered
investment advisers. A registered investment adviser trading for its “own account” as defined in
the Proposed Rules could implicate dealer registration requirements.117 The Commission is
mindful, however, that with some clients, a registered investment adviser only exercises
investment discretion over the client’s account, while with some other clients, the adviser also
may control the client through an ownership interest. The Proposed Rules take into account a

the SEC and the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel (“FSOC”) with additional
confidential information about private funds. Information reported on Form PF has
helped establish a baseline picture of the private fund industry for use in assessing
systemic risk. These proposed amendments would apply to large hedge fund advisers,
private equity advisers, and large liquidity fund advisers and are designed to enhance
FSOC’s and the Commission’s ability to monitor systemic risk, bolster the Commission’s
regulatory oversight of private fund advisers, and enhance investor protection efforts.

registered investment adviser’s role in determining what client trading activity should be
attributed to the adviser for purpose of the rules.118
Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comment on this aspect of the Proposed Rules. In
addition, the Commission requests comment on the following specific issues:
1. Should the Proposed Rules exclude persons that have or control less than $50
million in total assets? Are there instances in which persons that have or control
less than $50 million in total assets that are buying and selling securities or
government securities for their own accounts provide liquidity to the markets or
have a significant impact on the markets that would warrant regulation as dealers
or government securities dealers? Please explain.
2. Does the proposed $50 million in total assets threshold sufficiently distinguish
persons whose activity should not be captured for purposes of the Proposed
Rules? If not, is there another amount or measurement that would better
distinguish these smaller market participants and achieve the purposes of the
Proposed Rules? Please explain.
3. Would persons that would be captured by the Proposed Rules (i.e., have or control
more than $50 million in total assets) restructure their activities or change their
corporate structures for the purpose of avoiding registration, including
withdrawing or reducing their trading activities or ceasing investment strategies
that trigger the application of the Proposed Rules? What would be the effects of
such restructuring, withdrawal, or cessation? Please explain.
 118 See infra note 185 and accompanying text.
40
4. Should the Commission exclude registered investment companies from the scope
of the Proposed Rules? Why or why not? If they are not excluded, do registered
investment companies engage in activities that would be captured by the Proposed
Rules? Could a registered investment company comply with the requirements
applicable to dealers? What would be the potential costs and/or benefits of
requiring registered investment companies to register as dealers or government
securities dealers? Could the registered investment companies restructure their
activities to avoid dealer registration? What would be the effects of such
restructuring? Please explain.
5. The Proposed Rules do not exclude private funds, that is, pooled investment
vehicles that are exempted from the definition of “investment company” under
Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Should the
Commission except or exclude private funds from the scope of the Proposed
Rules? Why or why not? Should the Commission except or exclude private
funds advised by registered investment advisers from the scope of the Proposed
Rules? Do some private funds engage in activities that would be captured by the
Proposed Rules? Could a private fund comply with the requirements applicable
to dealers? What would be the potential costs and/or benefits of requiring private
funds to register as dealers or government securities dealers? Would private
funds restructure their activities to avoid registration as a dealer? What would be
the effects of such restructuring? Would private funds cease or reduce investment
strategies captured by the Proposed Rules to avoid registration as a dealer? If so,
41
what would be the effects of removing or reducing these investment strategies
from the markets? Please explain.
6. Should registered investment advisers trading for their own accounts be excluded
partially or entirely from the Proposed Rules? Why or why not? Could some
registered investment advisers engage in activities that meet the proposed
qualitative standards and trigger the application of the Proposed Rules? Could
some registered investment advisers engage in trading volume in government
securities that could exceed the quantitative threshold in proposed Rule 3a44-2?
If registered investment advisers were captured by the Proposed Rules, how
would they comply with the requirements applicable to dealers? Would the
registered investment advisers restructure their activities to avoid registration as a
dealer, including withdrawing or reducing their trading activities or ceasing or
reducing investment strategies that trigger the application of the Proposed Rules?
What would be the effects of such restructuring, withdrawal, or cessation? Please
explain.
7. Instead of addressing investment adviser and private fund dealer concerns under
the framework of existing dealer regulation, should the Commission consider a
proposed rulemaking under the Advisers Act to address these concerns? What
elements should be included in such a rulemaking? For example, should it
include transaction reporting and/or capital requirements?
8. Should the Commission except or exclude any other categories of persons from
the scope of the Proposed Rules? If so, what persons, and why? If not, why not?
B. Qualitative Standards
42
The qualitative standards in the Proposed Rules would build on existing statements by the
Commission and the courts regarding “dealer” activity to further define certain standards for
determining when a person that is engaged in buying and selling securities for its own account is
engaged in that activity “as a part of a regular business,” as that phrase is used in Sections 3(a)(5)
and 3(a)(44)(B) of the Exchange Act. Specifically, under paragraph (a)(1) of the Proposed
Rules, a person would be engaged in buying and selling securities for its own account “as a part
of a regular business” and so a dealer or a government securities dealer, if that person engages in
a routine pattern of buying and selling securities (or government securities) that has the effect of
providing liquidity to other market participants.
The Proposed Rules further identify three types of activities that would be considered to
have the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants: (i) routinely making roughly
comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities (or government
securities) in a day; or (ii) routinely expressing trading interests that are at or near the best
available prices on both sides of the market and that are communicated and represented in a way
that makes them accessible to other market participants; or (iii) earning revenue primarily from
capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer, or from capturing any
incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests. The following
discussion of the proposed qualitative standards is applicable to both rules, and references to
“dealer” activity apply equally to both “dealers” and “government securities dealers” under
Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the Exchange Act, respectively, unless otherwise indicated.
Under the Proposed Rules, a person’s securities trading activity would form a “part of a
regular business” when that person “engages in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities
[or government securities] that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market
43
participants.”119 Under this qualitative standard, when the frequency and nature of a person’s
securities trading is such that the person assumes a role—described as either market-making, de
facto market-making, or liquidity-providing—similar to the role that historically has been
performed by a set of registered dealers, that person would be deemed to be acting as a dealer or
government securities dealer.
120 As elaborated below, the Proposed Rules identify three patterns
of buying and selling that the Commission views as having the effect of providing liquidity—any
one of which is sufficient to require a person to register as a dealer. As discussed below, no
presumption shall arise that a person is not a dealer solely because that person does not engage in
the activities described in the Proposed Rules.121 Other patterns of buying and selling may have
the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants or otherwise require a person to
register under the Proposed Rules in accordance with applicable precedent.
The Commission has long identified activities related to liquidity provision as factors that
would indicate a person is “‘engaged in the business’ of buying and selling securities.”122
Historically, persons who provide liquidity in securities markets in exchange for compensation,
earning revenue from the act of buying and selling itself, have registered as dealers.123 And,
 119 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(a)(1) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(1).
120 See, e.g., 2002 Release at 67499.
121 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(c) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(c), discussed in Section III.E.
122 2002 Release at 67498–500. In addition, the staff has stated that, while “the practical
distinction between a ‘trader’ and a ‘dealer’ is often difficult to make and depends
substantially upon the facts, . . . [a]s a general matter, a trader does not[, among other
things,] . . . furnish the services which are usually provided by dealers, such as quoting
the market in one or more securities.” National Council of Savings Inst., SEC No-Action
Letter, 1986 WL 67129 (July 27, 1986) (the staff declined to take a no-action position
with respect to national trade association’s members as “a determination of a Member’s
status under the [Exchange] Act would depend upon an analysis of all of that Member’s
securities activities, and not just” the activities described in the request).

providers that includes but is broader than market makers, encompassing, for example,
professional floor traders who trade “in and out,” effect “about half of the transactions on the
floor of the stock exchange,” and whose “profits depend upon . . . running along and playing
with the trends and not getting caught taking positions.”124 As securities markets have evolved,
and new market participants have increasingly taken on market-making and liquidity-providing
roles, the Commission has stated that dealer activity includes not only “acting as a market
maker” but also “acting as a de facto market maker whereby market professionals or the public
look to the firm for liquidity.”125 Traders, by contrast, the Commission indicated, do “not
mak[e] a market in securities.”126

of block positioner, and any dealer who, with respect to a security, holds himself out (by
entering quotations in an inter-dealer communications system or otherwise) as being
willing to buy and sell such security for his own account on a regular or continuous
basis.”) (emphasis added). See also Stock Exchange Regulation: Hearing on H.R. 7852
and H.R. 8720 Before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73rd Congr.

include . . . the floor trader . . . [whose] profits depend upon his running along and

In the context of the Proposed Rules, and as discussed further below, a “pattern” of
trading means buying and selling repetitively. For a pattern to come within the Proposed Rules,
both purchases and sales would have to be “routine” and have “the effect of providing liquidity”
to other market participants. Further, as discussed below, the Proposed Rules would set forth
three standards that the Commission believes would appropriately distinguish and identify such
liquidity provision as a “regular business” as opposed to non-dealer, or trader, activity.
In this respect, the Proposed Rules focus on activity rather than label or status. The
Proposed Rules by their terms would cover any person (as defined above) who “engages in a
routine pattern of buying and selling securities [or government securities] that has the effect of
providing liquidity to other market participants,” regardless of whether the person labels itself, or
is commonly known as, a PTF.
The liquidity-providing activity captured by the Proposed Rules would include not only
passive liquidity-providing activity127 but also aggressive trading strategies, including structural
or directional trading128 that similarly permit a person to earn revenue from the act of buying and
 127 See Algorithmic Trading Staff Report at 39 (“Passive market-making involves submitting
non-marketable orders on both sides (buy or ‘bid,’ and sell or ‘offer’) of the
marketplace.”).
128 See id. at 39-41 (citing 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release and SEC Staff of
the Division of Trading and Markets, Equities Market Structure Literature Review Part
II: High Frequency Trading (Mar. 18, 2014)) (describing broad types of short-term high
frequency trading strategies). Market participants of the kind that this release addresses,
including PTFs, may carry out passive market making strategies. They may also engage
in a range of trading strategies that involve submitting aggressive orders, or a
combination of passive and aggressive orders, “sometimes rapidly demanding liquidity,
in order to quickly liquidate positions accumulated through providing liquidity.” See
Algorithmic Trading Staff Report at 39-40; see also “Making,” “taking” and the material

selling itself. In this regard, the Proposed Rules would cover persons who trade, as part of a
regular business,129 “in and out” and whose “profits depend upon . . . running along and playing
with the trends and not getting caught taking positions”—activity understood from the enactment
of the Exchange Act to be a form of dealer activity—as well as more traditional forms of
liquidity provision, such as market making.
130
The Proposed Rules further define three patterns of buying and selling that the
Commission views as having the effect of providing liquidity, which are discussed in turn below.
i. Routinely making roughly comparable purchases and sales of
the same or substantially similar securities in a day
Under the first enumerated pattern, in proposed Rules 3a44-2(a)(1)(i) and 3a5-4(a)(1)(i)
respectively, a person that, trading for its own account, “routinely mak[es] roughly comparable
purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day” would be engaged in
a pattern of trading that “has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,” and
therefore be a dealer or government securities dealer.

Based Approach, Yibing Xiong, Takashi Yamada, Takao Terano (2015); SEC Staff of
the Division of Trading and Markets, Equities Market Structure Literature Review Part
II: High Frequency Trading (Mar. 18, 2014). These passive and aggressive strategies are
often referred to as “liquidity providing” and “liquidity demanding” or “liquidity taking”
strategies respectively. See, e.g., Algorithmic Trading Staff Report. Under the Proposed
Rules, both passive and aggressive trading strategies would be considered forms of
liquidity provision.
129 See supra note 39.
130 Stock Exchange Regulation: Hearing on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720 Before the Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73rd Congr. 117 (1934) (statement of Thomas
Corcoran). For a discussion of “liquidity providing” versus “liquidity demanding”
trading strategies, see supra note 128.
131 See, e.g., Amendments to Regulation SHO, Exchange Act Release No. 58775, 73 FR
61690, 61699 (Oct. 17, 2008) (“Regulation SHO Amendments”), in which the
Commission stated that “[a] pattern of trading that includes both purchases and sales in
roughly comparable amounts to provide liquidity to customers or other broker-dealers”
47
“Routinely” as used in this standard relates to the frequency with which a person engages
in making roughly comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities
in a day. Here, “routinely” means more frequent than occasional but not necessarily
continuous,
132 such that a person’s transactions in roughly comparable positions, throughout the
day and routinely over time, constitute “[engaging] in a routine pattern of buying and selling
securities that has the effect of providing liquidity for market participants” under the Proposed
Rules. The Commission believes that this interpretation of “routinely” will separate persons

would be one indicia of bona-fide market-making activity for purposes of the exceptions
in 17 CFR 242.200 through 242.204 (Regulation SHO) to the locate and close-out
requirements. The determination of eligibility for the bona-fide market-making
exceptions is distinct from the determination of whether a person’s trading activity
indicates that such person is acting as a dealer under the Proposed Rule. Under the
Regulation SHO exception, for instance, the broker-dealer must also be providing widely
disseminated quotations near or at the market and put itself at market risk. As the
Commission has stated on numerous occasions, the determination of whether a particular
short sale qualifies for the bona-fide market-making exception depends on the particular
facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction(s). See infra note 157. Importantly,
under the Proposed Rules, a person’s intent is irrelevant; the Proposed Rules focus on the
“effect” of a person’s activity, and where a person’s activity “has the effect of providing
liquidity,” whether or not that effect is intended, the person would fall within the scope of
the Proposed Rules.
132 As discussed below in Section III.A.ii, the Commission believes it is appropriate to
use “routine,” rather than “regular” or “continuous,” as these standards may fail to
capture a number of significant firms, due to the unique characteristics of certain
liquidity providers in today’s markets. Unlike many traditional types of liquidity
providers, there are liquidity providers in today’s markets, such as PTFs, that despite
routine participation in the market, may at times interrupt their market activity so that it is
not always “continuous.” The Commission adopted a similar approach in connection
with its joint rulemaking with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding,
among other things, the definitions of “swap dealer” and “security-based swap dealer.”
See Entities Adopting Release at 30609 (“making a market in swaps is appropriately
described as routinely standing ready to enter into swaps at the request or demand of a
counterparty. In this regard, ‘routinely’ means that the person must do so more
frequently than occasionally, but there is no requirement that the person do so
continuously.”).
48
engaging in isolated or sporadic securities transactions from persons whose regularity of
participation in securities transactions demonstrates that they are acting as dealers.
As discussed above, the frequency with which a person buys and sells securities for its
own account is a common component of the dealer analysis: more frequent buying and selling is
indicative of dealer activity.
133 The first qualitative standard of the Proposed Rules describes a
regularity of participation far beyond the isolated transactions of non-dealers,
134 and focuses on a
pattern of trading because the consistency and regularity of their participation indicates that their
liquidity provision forms a part of a regular business.
Under the Proposed Rules, “roughly comparable” would generally capture purchases and
sales similar enough, in terms of dollar volume, number of shares, or risk profile, to permit
liquidity providers to maintain near market-neutral positions by netting one transaction against
another transaction. To be “roughly comparable,” the dollar volume or number of shares of, or
risk offset by, the purchases and sales need not be exactly the same, as requiring a full netting
of positions may fail to capture a number of significant firms, due to the unique
characteristics of certain liquidity providers in today’s markets.
135 Instead, “roughly
comparable” purchases and sales would fall within a reasonable range that generally would have
the effect of offsetting one transaction against the other. Generally speaking, although the
 133 See Section II.A.
134 See SEC v. Justin W. Keener d/b/a JMJ Financial, No. 1:20-CV-21254 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 21,
2022) (“Case law has established that the primary indicia in determining that a person has
‘engaged in the business’ within the meaning of the term ‘dealer’ is that the level of
participation in purchasing and selling securities involves more than a few isolated
transactions.” (emphasis added) (quoting Sodorff, 1992 WL 224082, at *4)).
135 See, e.g., 2002 Release (focusing, among other things, on a “regular turnover of
inventory” rather than requiring completely neutral positions).
49
Proposed Rules do not provide a bright-line test in connection with the qualitative factors, the
Commission believes that a person that closes or offsets, in the same day, the overwhelming
majority of the positions it has opened, has likely made “roughly comparable purchases and
sales.”136 This proposed standard would capture a fundamental aspect of both the traditional
dealer—who “buys securities . . . with a view to disposing them elsewhere” and “receives no
brokerage commission but relies for his compensation upon a favorable difference or spread
between the price at which he buys and the amount for which he sells”137—and the liquidity
provider whose trading strategies generally involve frequent turnover of positions on a shortterm basis, with overnight holdings of unhedged positions that are a fraction of their overall
intraday positions.
138
The Proposed Rules reflect the statutory distinction between “dealers” and “traders.” The
Commission has long distinguished dealer activity from trader activity by focusing on, among
other things, a dealer’s frequent turnover of positions—stating, for example, that the dealer “sells
securities . . . he has purchased or intends to purchase elsewhere or buys securities . . . with a
 136 The Proposed Rules do not provide a bright-line test to determine “roughly comparable”
purchases and sales. However, for purposes of the Economic Analysis of the Proposed
Rules, the Commission assumes a daily buy-sell imbalance between two identical or
substantially similar securities, in terms of dollar volume, below 10 percent or,
alternatively, 20 percent may be indicative of purchases and sales that are “roughly
comparable,” as described below in Section V.B.2.c. The Commission has requested
comment on whether this approach is appropriate and whether this standard should
include a trading threshold.
137 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Report on the Feasibility and
Advisability of the Complete Segregation of the Functions of Dealer and Broker XIV
(1936).

Report.
50
view to disposing of them elsewhere”139—as well as the frequency with which a person buys and
sells.
140 By targeting persons who routinely make roughly comparable purchases and sales of
the same or substantially similar securities, the Proposed Rules identify persons whose trading
has the effect of providing liquidity that requires dealer registration, and so distinguish those
persons who are acting as traders.
141
The Proposed Rules take into account the speed at which technology permits liquidity
providers today to turn over their positions and the fact that high-speed, anonymous trading
platforms allow liquidity providers to act as intermediaries without customers and without
holding an inventory of securities.
142 In addition, the Proposed Rules take into consideration the
frequency with which a person buys and sells securities, which is a factor historically considered
as part of the dealer analysis.
143 Because they are based on activity, the Proposed Rules would
cover not only PTFs, but also any other persons engaging in the identified activities.
Paragraph (a)(1)(i) of the Proposed Rules would also provide that the securities bought
and sold must be “the same or substantially similar” in order to further distinguish liquidity
 139 See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Report on the Feasibility and
Advisability of the Complete Segregation of the Functions of Dealer and Broker XIV
(1936).
140 See Section II.A.
141 See Section I.
142 See, e.g., Stock Exchange Regulation: Hearing on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720 Before the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73rd Congr. 117 (1934) (statement of
Thomas Corcoran) (discussing floor traders, which have long been viewed as dealers).
As the markets have evolved, the role of floor traders has largely been replaced by PTFs,
which play a role—albeit, electronically and through the use of algorithmic trading
strategies—similar to that of the floor traders that traditionally have been regulated as
dealers. See 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release at 3607-08.
143 See Section II.A.
51
providing dealer activity from non-dealer trader activity. As discussed above, routinely making
roughly comparable purchases and sales of securities keeps a liquidity provider’s market
positions near neutral only to the extent that a sale or another trade offsets the risk taken on
through a purchase. For purposes of the rule, “the same” securities means that the securities
bought and sold are securities of the same class and having the same terms, conditions, and
rights.144 Securities bearing the same Committee on Uniform Securities Identification
Procedures (“CUSIP”) number, for example, would be considered “the same.” In addition, the
determination of what would constitute “substantially similar” securities for purposes of the rule
would be based on the facts and circumstances analysis that would take into account factors such
as, for example, whether: (1) the fair market value of each security primarily reflects the
performance of a single firm or enterprise or the same economic factor or factors, such as interest
rates; and (2) changes in the fair market value of one security are reasonably expected to
approximate, directly or inversely, changes in, or a fraction or a multiple of, the fair market value
of the second security. A person routinely making roughly comparable purchases and sales of
the same or substantially similar securities, such that the sale or purchase of one security offsets
the risk associated with the sale or purchase of the other, permitting that person to maintain a
near market-neutral position, would meet this aspect of this standard.
Applying these principles, the Commission believes that the following are nonexclusive
examples of purchases and sales of “substantially similar” securities:
 144 See 17 CFR 227.300(b)(2) (Rule 300(b)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding) (permitting an
intermediary to have a financial interest in an issuer if, among other things, the financial
interest consists of securities of the same class and having the same terms, conditions and
rights as the securities being offered and sold on the intermediary’s platform.).

145 For
example, selling a 4.5-year Treasury security and buying a 5-year Treasury security, or a 9.5 year
Treasury security versus a 10-year Treasury security.
• Buying an exchange traded fund and selling the underlying securities that make up the
basket of securities held by the exchange traded fund that was purchased.
• Buying a European call option on a stock and selling a European put option on the same
stock with the same strike and maturity.
• Buying an OTC call option on a stock and selling a listed option on the same stock with
the same strike and maturity.
Conversely, the Commission believes that the following are examples of purchases and
sales of securities that are not “substantially similar”:
• Buying stock in one company (e.g., Ford) and selling stock in another company in the
same industry (e.g., Chrysler).
• Buying stock and selling bonds issued by the same company.
• Buying cash Treasury securities and selling Treasury futures.
Finally, the standard under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of the Proposed Rules would apply with
respect to purchases and sales made “in a day.” As discussed above, dealer liquidity providers
are distinguishable, in part, from traders and other market participants by the frequent turnover of
their positions. Traditional dealers often hold an inventory to enable them to buy from one
market participant and sell to another. Technological advancements have increased the speed at
 145 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “FAQs: Treasury Purchases,”
https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-reinvestments-purchases-faq.
53
which this process happens, eliminating in some cases the need to carry a traditional inventory at
all, as liquidity providers are able to source and unload securities extremely rapidly. The
Commission believes that a temporal component is necessary in paragraph (a)(1)(i) to distinguish
dealer liquidity providers from other market participants who may contribute liquidity to the
market periodically but not in the repeated, routine—and often relied upon—manner of liquidity
providers. The Commission believes that “in a day” is a period of sufficient duration to capture
the trading activity typical of dealer liquidity providers that are the focus of the Proposed Rules,
and still brief enough to exclude non-dealers pursuing longer-term investment strategies. In
addition, because PTFs tend to turn over their positions over the course of a day, “end[ing] the
day with little net directional exposure,”146 market practices support drawing the temporal line at
the end of the day.
ii. Routinely expressing trading interests that are at or near the
best available prices on both sides of the market and that are
communicated and represented in a way that makes them
accessible to other market participants
Proposed Rules 3a44-2(a)(1)(ii) and 3a5-4(a)(1)(ii) set forth the second pattern of trading
activity that “has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants.” Specifically,
under paragraph (a)(1)(ii), a person buying and selling for its own account that “routinely
express[es] trading interests that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the
market and that are communicated and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other
market participants” would be engaged in a pattern of trading in securities or government
securities that “has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,” and therefore
would be a dealer or government securities dealer under the Proposed Rules. As discussed
 146 See 2021 IAWG Joint Staff Report at 5.
54
below, the Proposed Rules would update the longstanding understanding that regular or
continuous quotation is a hallmark of market making or de facto market making (and, hence,
dealer) activity,
147 to reflect technological changes to the ways in which buyers and sellers of
securities are brought together.
The Proposed Rules would apply when a person “routinely” expresses trading interests.
Here, as well as in paragraph (a)(1)(i), “routinely” means that the person must express trading
interests more frequently than occasionally, but not necessarily continuously.148 As discussed
above in connection with paragraph (a)(1)(i), “routinely” relates to the frequency of the activity
both intraday and across time, and means both repeatedly within a day and on a regular basis
over time. The Commission believes it is appropriate to use “routinely,” rather than
“regular” or “continuous,” as the latter standards may fail to capture a number of significant
firms, due to the unique characteristics of certain liquidity providers in today’s markets.
Specifically, by using “routinely,” the Proposed Rules are intended to reflect market evolution to
capture significant liquidity providers who express trading interests at a high enough frequency
to play a significant role in price discovery and the provision of market liquidity, even if their
liquidity provision may not be continuous like that of some traditional dealers. At the same time,
 147 The term “market maker” includes, among other things, “any dealer who, with respect to
a security, holds itself out (by entering quotations in an inter-dealer quotation system or
otherwise) as being willing to buy and sell such security for its own account on a regular
or continuous basis.” See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(38). Moreover, the Commission has stated
previously that a market maker engaged in bona-fide market making is a “broker-dealer
that deals on a regular basis with other broker-dealers, actively buying and selling the
subject security as well as regularly and continuously placing quotations in a quotation
medium on both the bid and ask side of the market.” See, e.g., Exchange Act Release
No. 32632 (July 14, 1993), 58 FR 39072, 39074 (July 21, 1993).
148 See, e.g., Entities Adopting Release at 30609 (“In this regard, ‘routinely’ means that the
person must do so more frequently than occasionally, but there is no requirement that the
person do so continuously.”).
55
they are very active in the markets—their participation is very routine—as demonstrated by the
“key role” they play “in price discovery and the provision of market liquidity” in both the
interdealer U.S. Treasury market149 and the equity markets.
150
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) would also use the term “trading interest” rather than “quotations.”
The Commission has recently proposed to define “trading interest” to mean “an order, as defined
in paragraph (e) of [Rule 300 of Regulation ATS],
151 or any non-firm indication of a willingness
to buy or sell a security that identifies at least the security and either quantity, direction (buy or
sell), or price.”152 Technological advancements have proliferated methods by which market
participants hold themselves out as willing to buy or sell securities, or otherwise communicate
their willingness to trade. The broader term “trading interest” would reflect the prevalence of
non-firm trading interest offered by market places today,
153 and account for the varied ways in
which developing technologies permit market participants to effectively make markets. The
broader term appropriately captures the traditional quoting engaged in by dealer liquidity
 149 2021 IAWG Joint Staff Report at 5, 13.
150 See, e.g., Algorithmic Trading Staff Report; 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept
Release.
151 17 CFR 242.300(e) defines an “order” to mean “any firm indication of a willingness to
buy or sell a security, as either principal or agent, including any bid or offer quotation,
market order, limit order, or other priced order.”
152 See 2022 ATS Proposing Release, proposed Rule 300(q). In proposing this new term, the
Commission noted the incidence of “non-firm trading interest that includes the symbol
and one of the following: quantity, direction, or price. . . . The Commission believes that
. . . the use of a message that identifies the security and either the quantity, direction, or
price would provide sufficient information to bring together buyers and sellers of
securities because it allows a market participant to communicate its intent to trade and a
reasonable person receiving the information to decide whether to trade or engage in
further communications with the sender.” Id. at 15505.
153 See 2022 ATS Proposing Release at 15500-15502.
56
providers, new and developing quoting equivalents, and the orders that actually result in the
provision of liquidity that the Commission intends the Proposed Rules to address. Using
“trading interest,” as defined above, rather than “quotation” will allow for clear and consistent
application of the definition of dealer and government securities dealer.
Further, the Commission is proposing that the rules encompass trading interests
expressed “at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market.”154 The phrase “best
available prices on both sides of the market” more specifically and clearly describes the activity
of liquidity-providing dealers, which help determine the spread between the best available bid
price and the best available ask price for a given security. Among other market benefits, by
competing to both buy and sell at the best available prices, liquidity providers help to narrow
bid-ask spreads.155 The Commission further believes that the proposed formulation helps
emphasize that a liquidity provider, to come within the rule, must both buy and sell securities.
156
Finally, the Proposed Rules would apply only when these trading interests that are at or
near the best available prices on both sides of the market are “communicated and represented in a
way that makes them accessible to other market participants.” Under the Proposed Rules, a
 154 See, e.g., Regulation SHO Amendments, in which the Commission stated that quotations
near or at the market for a short sale in a security may provide an indication of bona-fide
market making for purposes of Regulation SHO, depending on the facts and
circumstances surrounding the activity. See also supra note 131.
155 See, e.g., Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading, Release No. BHCA-1;
File No. S7-41-11 (Dec. 10, 2013), 79 FR 5535, 5585-86 (Jan. 31, 2014), available at
https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2013/bhca-1.pdf (setting forth, among other things, the
circumstances in which a banking entity may engage market making-related activities)
(“Volcker Rule Adopting Release”) at 177.
156 See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5) (“The term ‘dealer’ means any person engaged in the
business of buying and selling securities” (emphasis added)); see also 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(44).
57
market participant that routinely makes these trading interests available to other market
participants would be considered to have engaged in a routine pattern of trading that has the
effect of providing liquidity to other market participants.157
iii. Earning revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by
buying at the bid and selling at the offer, or from capturing
any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying
trading interests
Proposed Rules 3a44-2(a)(1)(iii) and 3a5-4(a)(1)(iii) set forth the final enumerated
pattern of activity that “has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants.” Under
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of each rule, a person that, trading for its own account, “earn[s] revenue
primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer, or from
capturing any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests,”
would be engaging in a routine pattern of trading that has the effect of providing liquidity to
other market participants, and as a result, would be a dealer under the Proposed Rules.
 157 See, e.g., Regulation SHO Amendments (“Continuous quotations that are at or near the
market on both sides and that are communicated and represented in a way that makes
them widely accessible to investors and other broker-dealers are also an indication that a
market maker is engaged in bona-fide market making activity.”). But see supra note 131
(explaining that the determination of eligibility for Regulation SHO’s bona-fide
market-making exceptions is distinct from the determination of whether a person’s
trading activity indicates that such person is acting as a dealer under the Proposed
Rule). The Commission further notes that the bona-fide market-making exceptions under
Regulation SHO are only available to registered broker-dealers that publish continuous
quotations for a specific security in a manner that puts the broker-dealer at economic risk.
Broker-dealers that do not publish continuous quotations, or publish quotations that do
not subject the broker-dealer to such risk (e.g., quotations that are not publicly accessible,
are not near or at the market, or are skewed directionally towards one side of the market),
would not be eligible for the bona-fide market-maker exceptions under Regulation SHO.
In addition, broker-dealers that publish quotations but fill orders at different prices than
those quoted would not be engaged in bona-fide market making for purposes of
Regulation SHO.
58
As with other aspects of the Proposed Rules, this standard focuses on activity rather than
label or status. The Proposed Rules would apply to any person regardless of whether the person
labels itself, or is commonly known as, a PTF.
As discussed above, one fundamental characteristic typical of market makers and
liquidity providers—and one that has historically been viewed as dealer activity—is trading in a
manner designed to profit from spreads or liquidity incentives, rather than with a view toward
appreciation in value.158 The Commission has previously identified a person’s seeking, through
its presence in the market, compensation through spreads or fees, or other compensation not
attributable to changes in the value of the security traded, as a factor indicating dealer activity.
159
Dealer liquidity providers frequently are distinguishable from other market participants whose
 158 See, e.g., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Report on the Feasibility and
Advisability of the Complete Segregation of the Functions of Dealer and Broker XIV
(1936) (“The dealer . . . receives no brokerage commission but relies for his
compensation upon a favorable difference or spread between the price at which he buys
and the amount for which he sells.”). See also Entities Adopting Release at 30609
(“seeking to profit by providing liquidity to the market is an indication of dealer [as
opposed to trader] activity”).
159 See Entities Adopting Release at 30617 (identifying as an indication of dealer activity
which is consistent with the definition’s ‘‘regular business’’ requirement, “seeking
compensation in connection with providing liquidity . . . by seeking a spread, fees or
other compensation not attributable to changes in the value of the [security itself]”).
With respect to bid-ask spreads, the connection between liquidity provision and bid-ask
spreads is evident in the relationship among high volume, liquidity, and bid-ask spreads:
Because high volume can reduce a dealer’s overhead, high volume tends to make
liquidity provision more profitable; as liquidity provision becomes more profitable, more
persons compete to provide liquidity, and this increased competition tightens bid-ask
spreads, as the more competitive liquidity providers are willing to be compensated less
for the liquidity they provide in order to compete. See Section V.C.3.c. See also Volcker
Rule Adopting Release at 177 (“[L]iquidity provides important benefits to the financial
system, as more liquid markets are characterized by competitive market makers, narrow
bid-ask spreads, and frequent trading.”). Notably, a person may be acting as a dealer by
profiting from a spread even if they are not profiting from “bid-ask spreads” under the
Proposed Rules. See, e.g., River North, 415 F. Supp. at 859 (discussing Sodorff, 1992
WL 224082, at *5).
59
trades arguably “provide liquidity” inasmuch as dealers seek to be compensated for the service of
contributing to a market’s liquidity, whether by bid-ask spreads or liquidity incentives. They are
“in the business” of providing liquidity because they routinely supply it and the revenue they
earn as a result through bid-ask spreads or liquidity incentives is their primary source of revenue.
Both forms of revenue are accounted for in the Proposed Rules. The first—capturing
bid-ask spreads—is done by buying at the bid and selling at the offer, which would include
buying at a lower price than, and selling at a higher price than, the midpoint of the bid-ask
spread. The spread between these prices compensates them for providing the service of
liquidity—that is, of generally standing ready to buy or sell and enabling other market
participants to reliably make purchases and sales. When a liquidity provider routinely buys and
sells securities in a manner designed to capture a spread with such frequency and consistency
that its revenue is made up primarily of this form of compensation, it will be considered to be
engaged in a routine pattern of providing liquidity as a service and will fall within the scope of
the rules.
The second major source of revenue for market makers and other liquidity providers is
explicit liquidity-compensation arrangements. For example, many exchanges in the equities
markets have adopted a “maker-taker” pricing model to compensate (and thereby attract)
liquidity providers.160 Under this model, non-marketable, resting orders that offer (make)
liquidity at a particular price receive a liquidity rebate if they are executed, while incoming
orders that execute against (take) the liquidity of resting orders are charged an access fee.
161
 160 See 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release at 3599.
161 See 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release at 3599. Highly automated exchange
systems and liquidity rebates have contributed to the rise of PTFs that focus on liquidity
provision. Id.
60
When a liquidity provider, as a result of its routine purchases and sales of securities, captures
“incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests” with such
frequency and consistency that its revenue is made up primarily of this form of compensation, it
will be considered to be engaged in a routine pattern of providing liquidity as a service and
generally standing ready to buy or sell securities, so would fall within the scope of the Proposed
Rules.
To come within this paragraph of the Proposed Rules, a liquidity provider would have to
earn its revenue primarily from bid-ask spreads or trading incentives. The Proposed Rules use
the phrase “earn revenue”—rather than, for example, “profit from”—to make clear that a
person’s trading strategies would not need to be profitable to bring them within the rule because
a market participant can provide liquidity without being profitable. Furthermore, under the
Proposed Rules, a person whose revenue is derived “primarily” from capturing bid-ask spreads
or liquidity incentives, or a combination of the two, would be a liquidity provider that is engaged
in the regular business of buying and selling securities for its own account and, as a result, a
dealer or government securities dealer. Generally speaking, although the Proposed Rules do not
provide a bright-line test in connection with the qualitative factors, the Commission believes that
if a person derives the majority of its revenue from the sources described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii),
it would likely be in a regular business of buying and selling securities or government securities
for its own account.
Finally, the paragraph would apply with respect to activity on “trading venues.” The
Commission has recently proposed to define the term “trading venue” to mean “a national
securities exchange or national securities association that operates an SRO trading facility, an
ATS, an exchange market maker, an OTC market maker, a futures or options market, or any
61
other broker- or dealer-operated platform for executing trading interest internally by trading as
principal or crossing orders as agent.”162
Market evolution has given rise to a variety of venues in which liquidity providers can
express trading interests, and the definition is designed to capture the breadth of these different
venues. For example, Communication Protocol Systems, which are electronic systems that offer
the use of non-firm trading interest and make available communication protocols to bring
together buyers and sellers of securities but do not fall within the current definition of an
“exchange” under Federal securities laws, have come to perform the function of a market place
and become a preferred method for market participants to discover prices, find counterparties,
and execute trades.163 The Proposed Rules are designed to capture dealer activity wherever that
activity occurs, whether on a national securities exchange, an ATS, a Communication Protocol
System, or another form of trading venue. For purposes of the Proposed Rules, the particular
trading venue matters less than the fact that a market participant provides liquidity on it. Using
the broad term “trading venue,” as defined above, will allow for clear and consistent application
of the definitions of dealer and government securities dealer.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on these provisions of the Proposed Rules.
In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
9. Is there sufficient specificity provided for the terms used in the qualitative
standards? Are there any terms that should be defined in rule text or addressed in
the release?
 162 2022 ATS Proposing Release at 15540.
163 See 2022 ATS Proposing Release at 15496 n.5 and 15501. This is particularly true for
government securities and other fixed income securities. Id.
62
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “pattern”? If not, what
additional specificity should the Commission provide and please provide
specific examples on the types of specificity. Should the rule text define what
is meant by “pattern”? Why or why not? Is the Proposed Rules’ use of
“pattern” appropriate? Would “manner” or another word be more
appropriate? Why or why not?
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “effect of providing
liquidity”? If not, what additional specificity should the Commission provide
and please provide specific examples on the types of specificity. Should the
rule text define what is meant by “effect of providing liquidity”? Why or why
not? Is the Proposed Rules’ use of “effect of providing liquidity” appropriate?
Would replacing “effect of providing liquidity” with “market making” be
more appropriate? Are there other words that would more appropriate? Why
or why not?
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “primarily”? Should the
rule text define what is meant by “primarily”? Why or why not? Is the
Proposed Rules’ use of “primarily” appropriate? Would “mostly” or another
word be more appropriate? Why or why not?
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “trading venue”? If not,
what additional specificity should the Commission provide and please provide
specific examples on the types of specificity. Should the rule text define what
is meant by “trading venue”? Why or why not? Is the Proposed Rules’ use of
63
“trading venue” appropriate? Are there other words that would be more
appropriate? Why or why not?
10. Is liquidity provision an appropriate factor to use in defining which buying and
selling activity for one’s own account qualifies as “regular business”? Are there
other factors the Commission should include? If so, which factors and why? Are
there trading activities or investment strategies that should not be considered
providing liquidity? If so, please describe why.
11. Are the three qualitative factors identified in the Proposed Rules as having the
“effect of providing liquidity to other market participants” that would qualify as
“regular business” appropriate? Are there any other forms of liquidity provision,
or any other factors, that the Commission should include or exclude instead or in
addition to those proposed? Are the factors over or under-inclusive? If so, please
provide specific examples of any alternative suggestions.
• For example, should the Commission include as an example of a “liquid
market,” “a market in which participants have the ability to readily trade at a
predictable price and in a desired size without materially moving the market”?
Why or why not?
• In addition to passive “liquidity providing” trading strategies, the Proposed
Rules would capture certain aggressive “liquidity demanding” strategies as
having the “effect of providing liquidity to other market participants”? Is this
appropriate? Why or why not?
12. Under the Proposed Rules, a person routinely making roughly comparable
purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day would
64
have the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants, and therefore
would be a dealer. Is this an appropriate measure or illustration of liquidity
provision? Why or why not? Would the provision capture persons that should
not be dealers? If so, who and why?
• For example, would the Proposed Rules capture private funds and other
persons pursing investment strategies such as relative value fixed income
arbitrage or share class arbitrage? If so, should such strategies be included or
excluded? Why or why not?
• Is there sufficient specificity to determine which securities would be
considered “same” or “substantially similar”? Why or why not? If not, what
additional specificity should the Commission provide and please provide
specific examples on the types of specificity. Should additional or different
factors be considered? Are there other words that would be more appropriate?
Why or why not?
• Should the rule text define what is meant by “same” or “substantially
similar”? Why or why not?
• Are there other types of purchase and sale transactions that would be
examples of purchases and sales of securities that are “substantially similar”
(i.e., other types of roughly comparable purchases and sales of substantially
similar securities, such that the sale or purchase of one security offsets the risk
associated with the sale or purchase of the other, permitting a person to
maintain a near market-neutral position)? Are there examples of types of
purchase and sale transactions involving derivatives, or other products that
65
represent the economic equivalent of another security, that would be
purchases and sales of securities that are “substantially similar”? Please
explain.
13. Although the Proposed Rules do not provide a bright-line test to determine
“roughly comparable” purchases and sales, depending on the facts and
circumstances, the Commission believes a daily buy-sell imbalance, as described
below in Section V.B.2.c., between two identical or substantially similar
securities, in terms of dollar volume below 20 percent may be indicative of
purchases and sales that are “roughly comparable.” Is this an appropriate
measurement of “roughly comparable”? Why or why not? Would another
measurement be more appropriate? Should there be a minimum trading volume
or dollar amount threshold as part of the qualitative standard under paragraph
(a)(1)(i), daily buy-sell imbalance, or other measurement?
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “roughly comparable”?
Why or why not? If not, what additional specificity should the Commission
provide and please provide specific examples on the types of specificity. Is
the Proposed Rules’ use of “roughly comparable” appropriate? Are there
other words that would be more appropriate? Why or why not?
• Should the rule text define, as opposed to the release addressing, what is
meant by “roughly comparable”? Why or why not?
• Does there need to be more specificity provided as to how many transactions
must be executed (or positions opened and/or closed) in a day to be “roughly
comparable”?
66
• Is “in a day” an appropriate period of time during which to measure whether
a person has made roughly comparable purchases and sales of the same or
substantially similar securities? If not, what is an appropriate time period?
• If an institutional investor seeks to rebalance its portfolio, would the
institutional investor typically “routinely make roughly comparable purchases
and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day,” or otherwise
trigger the Proposed Rules?
14. Under the Proposed Rules, a person that “routinely express[es] trading interests
that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market and that are
communicated and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other
market participants” would have the effect of providing liquidity to other market
participants, and thus would be a dealer. Is this an appropriate measure or
illustration of liquidity provision? Why or why not? Would the provision capture
persons that should not be dealers? If so, who and why?
• Is the Proposed Rules’ use of “routinely” appropriate? Would “regularly” or
“continuously” or another word be more appropriate? Why or why not?
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “routinely”? If not, what
additional specificity should the Commission provide and please provide
specific examples on the types of specificity. Should the rule text define what
is meant by “routinely”? Why or why not?
• Is the Proposed Rules’ use of “trading interest” appropriate? Would
“quotations” or another term be more appropriate? Why or why not?
67
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “trading interest”?
Should the rule text define what is meant by “trading interest”? Why or why
not? If not, what additional specificity should the Commission provide and
please provide specific examples on the types of specificity.
• The Proposed Rules would require that trading interests be communicated
and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other market
participants in order to come within the rule. Should the Commission require
that the trading interests be communicated “widely”? Why or why not?
15. Under the Proposed Rules, a person that “earn[s] revenue primarily from
capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer, or from
capturing any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading
interest,” would have the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants.
Is this an appropriate measure or illustration of liquidity provision? Why or why
not? Would the provision capture persons that should not be dealers? If so, who
and why?
• Is there sufficient specificity provided for the term “earn revenue”? If not,
what additional specificity should the Commission provide and please provide
specific examples on the types of specificity. Is the Proposed Rules’ use of
“earn revenue” appropriate? Are there other words that would be more
appropriate? Why or why not? Should the rule text define what is meant by
“earn revenue”? Why or why not?
• Should the Proposed Rules include additional or other forms of revenue?
68
• Should the Proposed Rules include other measures of liquidity provision? If
so, what measures and why?
• As explained above, buying at the bid and selling at the offer would include
buying at lower than, and selling at higher than, the midpoint of the bid-ask
spread. Should the rule text define “capturing bid-ask spread” to expressly
include buying at lower than, and selling at higher than, the midpoint of the
bid-ask spread?
16. Do the Proposed Rules provide sufficient specificity to permit market participants
to distinguish between revenue derived from capturing bid-ask spreads and
revenue derived from realization of appreciation of the underlying asset?
C. Quantitative Standard
In addition to the qualitative standards described above, proposed Rule 3a44-2 would
also include a quantitative standard that would establish a bright-line test under which persons
engaging in certain specified levels of activity in the U.S. Treasury market would be defined to
be buying and selling securities “as a part of a regular business,” regardless of whether they meet
any of the qualitative standards. Specifically, proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(2) would provide that a
person164 that is engaged buying and selling government securities for its own account is
engaged in such activity “as a part of a regular business” if that person in each of four out of the
 164 In light of the statutory definition of “person,” in conjunction with the proposed
definitions of “own account” and “control,” as discussed in Section III.D, trading volume
would be determined by aggregating volume at the firm or legal-entity level (rather than
market participant identifier (“MPID”) or global firm level). See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(9).
69
last six calendar months, engaged in buying and selling more than $25 billion of trading volume
in government securities as defined in Section 3(a)(42)(A) of the Exchange Act.165
The Commission believes that four out of the last six calendar months is an appropriate
range of time to evaluate the trading volume of a market participant and should help to ensure
the proposed quantitative standard does not capture market participants with relatively low
trading volume that may have had an anomalous increase in trading. The proposed time
measurement period would smooth monthly variations by reducing the effect of trading
fluctuations in a particular month that could misrepresent or distort a market participant’s overall
trading pattern.166 A shorter period of time could potentially cause a market participant to fall
within the scope of the quantitative standard solely as a result of an atypical, short-term increase
in trading, which potentially could discourage participation in the U.S. Treasury market by a new
market participant that has not had as long of a time period to develop its business prior to
 165 Proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(2) only applies to government securities as defined in
Section 3(a)(42)(A) of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the trading volume threshold set
forth in the proposed rule does not apply to all government securities as defined by
Section 3(a)(42); but rather, it is limited to “securities which are direct obligations of, or
obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States” (“U.S. Treasury
Securities”). See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42)(A). For purposes of determining whether the
trading volume threshold is met, a person would include transactions in U.S. Treasury
Securities – that is, Treasury bills, notes, floating rate notes, bonds, inflation-protected
securities (“TIPS”), and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities
(“STRIPS”) – and would exclude auction awards and repurchase or reverse repurchase
transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities. See 2022 ATS Proposing Release at 15542 nn.
512-517 (describing U.S. Treasury Securities). Additionally, for purposes of determining
whether the trading volume threshold is met, Treasury when-issued transactions would be
included.
166 This Commission has adopted regulations that use the four out of the last six calendar
months metric in Regulation ATS, Rules 301(b)(5) and (6), and Regulation SCI Rule
1000. See 17 CFR 242.301(b)(5)-(6) (definition of an SCI alternative trading system or
SCI ATS); see also Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, Exchange Act No.
73639 (Nov. 19, 2014), 79 FR 72251 (Dec. 5, 2014) (noting that time measurement
period of four of the preceding six months is consistent with the current standard under
Regulation ATS).

having to incur compliance costs associated with being subject to dealer registration. In addition,
the Commission does not believe that a longer period of time is necessary to identify those
market participants that play a significant role, and regularly transact, in U.S. Treasury
Securities. The Commission believes that the proposed time measurement period provides
sufficient trading history data so as to indicate a market participant’s significance to the market,
and that the structure of the measurement (i.e., requiring a market participant to meet the
threshold for four out of the last six calendar months) identifies regularity of such significant
trading levels.
As discussed below, the Commission’s analysis of market participants that are not
members of FINRA in the U.S. Treasury market found that these participants accounted for
approximately 19 percent of the aggregate Treasury trading volume in July 2021, with PTFs
representing the highest volumes of trading among these participants.
167 In addition, PTFs
dominate the interdealer U.S. Treasury market, representing 61 percent of the trading activity on
the electronic IDB platforms and 48 percent of the total interdealer market.168
Although, as noted previously, the Proposed Rules alone will not necessarily prevent
future market disruptions, the operation of proposed Rule 3a44-2 will support transparency;
market integrity and resiliency; and investor protection across the U.S. Treasury market by
 167 See Section V.B.2. Specifically, the analysis identified 174 market participants who were
active in the U.S. Treasury market in July 2021 and that were not members of FINRA.
Although FINRA membership is not synonymous with dealer registration status, the
Commission believes that many of the market participants who are not FINRA members
are also likely not registered as government securities dealers. These 174 identified nonFINRA member market participants accounted for approximately 19 percent of aggregate
Treasury trading volume in July 2021. PTFs had the highest volumes among these
identified non-FINRA member U.S. Treasury market participants. See Section V.B.2.

helping to close the regulatory gap that currently exists and by ensuring consistent regulatory
oversight.
169 The lack of consistent visibility across the market today constrains the ability of
regulators to understand and respond to significant market events. The proposed quantitative
standard is intended to capture the most significant market participants that are regularly buying
and selling U.S. Treasury Securities, and subject these participants that are not already registered
as dealers or government securities dealers to a regulatory regime designed to minimize the risks
they may pose to the U.S. Treasury market and provide regulators with appropriate oversight of
their activities.
As described below in Section V, the proposed trading volume threshold was derived
from analysis of historical U.S. Treasury Securities transactions reported to TRACE.
170 Based
on this analysis, the Commission is proposing a trading volume amount of $25 billion; this
quantitative standard would likely capture mostly unregistered PTFs, but also may capture
certain other significant market participants not currently registered as government securities
 169 For example, regulators do not have the same insight into the trading activities of
unregistered PTFs because, unlike registered dealers, they do not report their U.S.
Treasury Securities transactions to FINRA’s Trading Reporting and Compliance Engine
(“TRACE”), do not file annual reports with the Commission, and are not subject to
Commission examinations. See Section V.B.3. Market participants that are private funds
are generally managed by registered investment advisers that file regular financial reports
with the Commission on Form PF, and are subject to examination concerning their
private fund clients, but private funds do not report securities transactions such as those
required by the rules governing registered dealers. See id. Transactions in fixed income
securities, such as U.S. Treasury Securities, are not currently reported to the Consolidated
Audit Trail (“CAT”). See Section V.B.2 (explaining the type of transactions reported to
CAT).
170 TRACE reporting requirements apply to all marketable U.S. Treasury Securities,
including Treasury bills, notes, floating rate notes, bonds, TIPS, and STRIPS. See
FINRA Rule 6700 series. Under FINRA Rules, “Bona fide repurchase and reverse
repurchase transactions involving TRACE-Eligible Securities” and “Auction
Transactions” are not reported to TRACE. See FINRA Rule 6730(e).
72
dealers.171 In determining whether the trading volume threshold is met, a market participant
would include transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities that are currently reported to TRACE—
that is, Treasury bills, notes, floating rate notes, bonds, TIPS, and STRIPS—and would exclude
auction awards and repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities.172
The proposed quantitative standard is intended to be a straightforward threshold identifying those
market participants that, as a result of their regularly high trading volume in government
securities, serve dealer-like roles significantly impacting the U.S. Treasury market. In this
regard, the Commission believes that setting forth a trading volume threshold would provide an
easily measurable and observable standard.
As discussed above, the market structure for U.S. Treasury securities has evolved, with
PTFs accounting for a large percent of trading volume.173 In some ways, PTFs have displaced
the role of traditional dealers in the interdealer U.S. Treasury market, and the Commission
believes that PTFs, and other market participants that similarly have a significantly large, and
regular, amount of trading volume and have a significant impact on the U.S. Treasury market,
should register as government securities dealers.174 Proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(2) is designed to
make clear the Commission’s view that a person engaging in this regular volume of buying and
 171 As described in Section V.B.2, the analysis found 46 non-FINRA member firms with
trading volumes of at least $25 billion in July 2021. Based on classifications (further
explained infra note 218), of these 46 non-FINRA member firms, 22 are classified as
PTFs and 20 are classified as dealers. See Section V.B.2, Table 1. To the extent a nonFINRA member firm is a financial institution, it would not register with the Commission
but instead would provide written notice of its government securities dealer status with
the appropriate Federal banking regulator. See Section II; 17 CFR 400.1. Additionally, a
non-FINRA member firm may be operating in reliance on an exception or exemption.
See supra note 29 and accompanying text.

73
selling activity is engaged in the buying and selling of government securities for its own account
as a part of a regular business, and therefore, should be subject to the same regulatory
requirements as other dealers.
The Commission believes the need for a quantitative rule is most acute in the U.S.
Treasury market. Thus, while proposed Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2 share common qualitative
standards, the Commission is proposing a quantitative standard only with respect to the U.S.
Treasury market at this time. As explained more fully in Section V, the quantitative standard is
derived from trading data related to the U.S. Treasury market, and is intended to identify
significant market participants not registered as dealers that are performing dealer-like activities
in the U.S. Treasury market.175
The recent disruptions in the U.S. Treasury market referenced above, together with the
significant role played by market participants not registered as dealers, distinguishes that market
from other markets where these types of participants are more typically registered as dealers.
Indeed, it is the Commission’s understanding that in the equity markets, because PTF trading
strategies typically depend on latency and cost advantages made possible by trading directly (via
membership) on a national securities exchange, and the Exchange Act limits exchange
membership to registered broker-dealers, there is incentive for many PTFs to register as broker-
 175 The Commission believes that due to the varying characteristics of the other securities
markets, setting a quantitative standard would be more complicated and each market
would need to be separately assessed before a quantitative threshold is set. Accordingly,
the Proposed Rules do not set forth a comparable quantitative standard for proposed Rule
3a5-4. The Commission is seeking comment, however, on whether proposed Rule 3a5-4
should include a quantitative standard, and if so, how it should be established. See
Question 26.
74
dealers to gain these advantages.176 In the U.S. Treasury market, however, where trading occurs
on ATSs and other non-exchange venues, PTFs lack this incentive to register.
Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comment on this aspect of proposed Rule 3a44-2. In
addition, the Commission requests comment on the following specific issues:
17. Is there sufficient specificity provided for the terms used in the quantitative
standard? Are there any terms that should be defined in rule text or addressed in
the release?
18. Is the threshold of more than $25 billion of trading volume in each of four out of
the last six calendar months an appropriate proxy for determining whether a
person is engaged in buying and selling U.S. Treasury Securities for its own
account is engaged in such activity as a part of a regular business? Why or why
not? If not, what thresholds would be appropriate? For example, should the
quantitative standard include a separate trading volume threshold for: (1) buying;
(2) selling; and (3) both buying and selling U.S. Treasury Securities, all three of
which would be required to be satisfied in order to meet the quantitative standard?
Commenters should provide data to support their views.
19. Should the Commission apply a different look-back period for applying the
quantitative threshold from four out of the preceding six months to something
different? Is the time period measurement of four out of the last six calendar
months an appropriate metric to evaluate a market participant’s trading volume?
 176 See 15 U.S.C. 78f(c)(1) (“A national securities exchange shall deny membership to (A)
any person, other than a natural person, which is not a registered broker or dealer or (B)
any natural person who is not, or is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.”).
75
Should the time period be a weekly measurement or is there another measurement
that would better determine whether a person is engaged in buying and selling
U.S. Treasury Securities for its own account is engaged in such activity as a part
of a regular business?
20. Should the look-back period for the quantitative standard take into consideration
the general auction schedule for U.S. Treasury securities? Should the look-back
period correspond with the schedule of any particular U.S. Treasury
security? Why or why not? For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note
auctions are usually announced in the first half of February, May, August, and
November and generally auctioned during the second week of these months and
are issued on the 15th of the same month.177 Should the look-back period take
into consideration these particular months for purposes of the quantitative
standard? Why or why not? How could the look-back period incorporate the
auction schedule? Please explain.
21. Are there persons that would meet the quantitative standard under the proposed
rule but that should not be classified as government securities dealers (i.e., is the
quantitative standard over-inclusive?). If so, who are they and why should the
Commission not classify them as government securities dealers?
22. Are there persons that would not meet the quantitative standard under the
proposed rule—and would not be otherwise captured by the qualitative factors—
but that should be classified as government securities dealers based on their
 177 See TreasuryDirect, General Auction Timing, available at
https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/auctfund/work/auctime/auctime.htm.
76
trading volume (i.e., is the quantitative standard under-inclusive)? If so, who are
they and why should they be classified as government securities dealers?
23. Should the quantitative standard include an additional standard related to
routinely expressing trading interests? For example, activity related to resting
orders on a central-limit order book, or expressing trading interest on
Communication Protocol Systems? If so, what measure of activity, including
sources of data and calculation methodology, would appropriately identify market
participants as government securities dealers?
24. Are there other ways of calculating a quantitative standard, such as using a
measurement based on turnover (e.g., a turnover ratio) rather than volume, or
other measurements of significance (e.g., a trading volume ratio, net/gross ratio)
that would appropriately identify market participants as government securities
dealers? If so, what are they, and why are they relevant in the context of
analyzing dealer status? Commenters should provide any data or information to
support their views.
25. Should the quantitative standard be a dynamic trading volume threshold that
changes with the market over time, such as percentage of transactions reported to
TRACE, a percentage of U.S. Treasury Securities outstanding or issued, or other
inflation-adjusted threshold? Why or why not?
26. Should a quantitative standard be included in proposed Rule 3a5-4? To the extent
a quantitative standard should be included, are there ways of calculating the
standard for other securities markets? Is a trading volume threshold suitable for
other types of securities markets?
77
27. In determining whether the trading volume threshold is met, the Commission has
indicated that market participants should exclude auction awards and repurchase
or reverse repurchase transactions. Is this exclusion appropriate? Should some or
all of these transactions be included? Are there other transactions that should be
excluded (e.g., Treasury when-issued transactions)? Please explain. Should any
excluded transactions be specifically addressed in rule text? Should there be a
similar exclusion of these types of transactions for purposes of evaluating whether
a market participant has met the qualitative standards? Are there any types of
transactions that should be included in calculating the trading volume amount?
28. Are there market participants that would fluctuate between meeting or not
meeting the quantitative standard (or qualitative standard) (e.g., initially meet the
standard, a few months later no longer meet the standard, and later meet the
standard again)? Would this pattern be associated with a particular type of
trading such that there may be periods in which the participant meets neither the
quantitative standard nor any qualitative standard?
29. Are there circumstances in which a person triggering the quantitative threshold
would not also trigger the proposed qualitative standards? Please describe those
circumstances in detail. In such case, would firms implement compliance systems
to monitor trading volumes? Do firms have systems in place that already or could
easily be programmed to monitor for the proposed quantitative threshold? What
are the costs of implementing such systems or updating existing systems? Would
firms be incentivized to trade below the proposed quantitative standard to avoid
registration?

D. Definitions of “Own Account” and “Control”
The Exchange Act defines a “dealer” or “government securities dealer” as a person
engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for its “own account.”178 The Proposed
Rules define a person’s “own account” in a way that recognizes that corporate families and
entities may be organized in various structures. The proposed definitions of “own account” and
“control” are designed to focus on the trading activity occurring at the firm or legal-entity level
or the trading activity that is being employed on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the entity, and
limit the registration burden to those entities engaged in dealer activity. In addition, the
proposed definitions are intended to avoid incentivizing market participants to change their
corporate structures for the purpose of avoiding registration.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of the Proposed Rules, a person’s “own account” means any
account that is: “held in the name of that person”; or “held in the name of a person over whom
that person exercises control or with whom that person is under common control, provided that
this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) does not include [the accounts described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)-
(C)]”; or “held for the benefit of those persons identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii).”179
Paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)-(C) excludes an account in the name of a registered broker, dealer, or
government securities dealer, or an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940; with respect to an investment adviser registered under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, an account held in the name of a client of the adviser unless the adviser
 178 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5) (“The term ‘dealer’ means any person engaged in the business of
buying and selling securities . . . for such person’s own account through a broker or
otherwise.”) (emphasis added); 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(44) (“The term ‘government securities
dealer’ means any person engaged in the business of buying and selling government
securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise. . .”) (emphasis added).
179 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(b)(2) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(b)(2).
79
controls the client as a result of the adviser’s right to vote or direct the vote of voting securities
of the client, the adviser’s right to sell or direct the sale of voting securities of the client, or the
adviser’s capital contributions to or rights to amounts upon dissolution of the client; and with
respect to any person, an account in the name of another person that is under common control
with that person solely because both persons are clients of an investment adviser registered under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 unless those accounts constitute a parallel account
structure.
180
With respect to which accounts should be aggregated for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii),
the Proposed Rules would incorporate the definition of “control” under Exchange Act Rule 13hl.
181 The Commission believes that incorporating the established definition of “control” under
Exchange Act Rule 13h-l into the Proposed Rules would promote consistency and assist persons
in applying the definition. The Commission further believes that the proposed definition of
“control” is sufficiently limited to capture only those market participants with a significant
enough controlling interest to warrant registration as a dealer.182 The proposed definition of
 180 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(b)(2)(ii)(A)-(C) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(b)(2)(ii)(A)-(C).
181 Exchange Act Rule 13h-l(a)(3) provides that control (including the terms controlling,
controlled by and under common control with) means the possession, direct or indirect,
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person,
whether through the ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise. For purposes of
Rule 13h-l only, any person that directly or indirectly has the right to vote or direct the
vote of 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities of an entity or has the power to
sell or direct the sale of 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities of such entity,
or in the case of a partnership, has the right to receive, upon dissolution, or has
contributed, 25 percent or more of the capital, is presumed to control that entity. 17 CFR
240.13h-l(a)(3). The definition of “control” in Rule 13h-l is based on the definition of
“control” in Form 1 (Application for the Registration or Exemption from Registration as
a National Securities Exchange) and Form BD (Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer
Registration).
182 As noted above, the Commission has applied this standard in other contexts. See Large
Trader Reporting, Exchange Act Release No. 61908 (Apr. 14, 2010), 75 FR 21456,
80
“control” used in Rule 13h-l is appropriate because it is less burdensome than other Commission
rules defining control, but still achieves the goal of identifying persons who exert direct or
indirect control over significant market participants.183 In addition, the Commission believes
that this definition of control would appropriately deter the structuring of corporate relationships
or establishment of multiple legal entities to avoid the Proposed Rules.
The Proposed Rules exclude three types of accounts from being aggregated with another
account for purposes of the definition of “own account.” First, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A),
where an account is held in the name of a person who is a registered broker, dealer, government
securities dealer, or registered investment company (collectively, “registered person”), the
Commission believes that it would be inappropriate to attribute the registered person’s accounts
to controlling persons or persons under common control, because the registered person is already
subject to the broker-dealer regulatory regime or the investment company regulatory
regime.184 Thus, the definition of “own account” would not include those types of accounts.

21461 (Apr. 23, 2010) (“The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
definition of control is sufficiently limited to capture only those persons with a significant
enough controlling interest to warrant identification as a large trader.”). The definition of
“control” in Rules 13h-l and on Forms 1 and BD is less expansive than the definition of
control as used in 17 CFR 240.19h-1 (Rule 19h-1), for example. In Rule 19h-1(f)(2), the
definition of “control” features a 10 percent threshold with respect to the right to vote 10
percent or more of the voting securities or receive 10 percent or more of the net profits.
183 The Commission is not incorporating the provision contained in the Form 1 and Form BD
relating to directors, general partners, or officers that exercise executive responsibility.
Instead, the proposed definition of “control” focuses on the existence of a corporate
control relationship over significant market participants.
184 As discussed in Section II.A, the Proposed Rules would exclude registered investment
companies in light of the regulatory framework that applies under the Investment
Company Act and rules thereunder.
81
Second under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B), the Proposed Rules would not attribute to a
registered investment adviser an account held in the name of a client of the adviser, unless the
adviser controls the client as a result of the adviser’s right to vote or direct the vote of voting
securities of the client, the adviser’s right to sell or direct the sale of voting securities of the
client, or the adviser’s capital contributions to or rights to amounts upon dissolution of the
client.
185
Under the aggregation provisions of the Proposed Rules, a registered investment adviser
that has an investment advisory relationship and is determined to control the client would be
required to aggregate its trading activities with those of the client.186 The Proposed Rules’
aggregation provisions are designed to account for trading activity within a corporate family in
which trading activity at a firm or legal-entity level is employed on behalf of or for the benefit of
another legal entity. In the case of registered investment advisers that have no controlling
ownership interest in an entity for which they are solely managing client assets, the trading
activities of the adviser and each client are independent of each other and are not for the benefit
of the adviser or any other client. Nevertheless, the Commission recognizes, in the absence of
 185 Registered investment advisers typically have investment discretion over the assets of the
accounts of their clients, including private funds and other client accounts that are
managed separately (“separately managed accounts”). Each of these clients has its own
independent investment objectives and strategies, which the registered investment adviser
implements as agent for the client. Moreover, investors in different private funds
typically differ in their investment objectives and strategies, as do owners of the assets in
separately managed accounts. A registered investment adviser has a duty to provide
investment advice in the best interest of its client, based on the client’s investment
objectives, see Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5248 (June 5, 2019), 84 FR 33669,
33671 (July 12, 2019), and so the Proposed Rules would not require aggregation solely
because a registered investment adviser exercises discretion.
186 For purposes of the Proposed Rules “control” is defined to include “the possession, direct
or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies
whether through the ownership of securities, by contract or otherwise.” See supra note
181; 17 CFR 240.13h-l(a)(3).
82
the proposed exclusion for such accounts, questions could arise whether the Proposed Rules
could require the aggregation of client trading activities with those of the registered investment
adviser. Because some clients may have similar trading strategies, their trading activities in the
aggregate could meet the proposed qualitative or quantitative standards. This would result in the
application of the Proposed Rules to the activities of a registered investment adviser and those of
its clients even when none of the entities is engaged in dealer activity for the economic benefit of
another. To reduce the potential for capturing registered investment advisers and their clients in
these circumstances, we are proposing to exclude registered investment advisers from
aggregating their trading activities with those of their clients when the adviser and client only
have a discretionary investment management relationship (i.e., where the registered investment
adviser does not control the client as a result of the adviser’s right to vote or direct the vote of
voting securities of the client, the adviser’s right to sell or direct the sale of voting securities of
the client, or the adviser’s capital contributions to or rights to amounts upon dissolution of the
client).
187
The Proposed Rules, however, are designed to address situations in which a registered
investment adviser might use the proposed exclusion to avoid the application of the Proposed
Rules. For example, a registered investment adviser that has a controlling ownership interest in a
client could attempt to divide trading activities among several clients it controls to avoid dealer
registration by any individual client whose trading activities would meet either of the Proposed
Rules. In those circumstances, the aggregate trading activities of each client could be designed
to economically benefit the registered investment adviser and, if aggregated, the activities would
fall within the intended scope of the Proposed Rules. To prevent such potentially evasive
 187 See text in 3a5-4(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 3a44-2(b)(2)(ii)(B) of the Proposed Rules.
83
structures, the proposed exclusion from aggregation does not apply to any registered investment
adviser that controls the client as a result of the registered investment adviser’s right to vote or
direct the vote of voting securities of the client, the registered investment adviser’s right to sell or
direct the sale of voting securities of the client, or the adviser’s capital contributions to or rights
to amounts upon dissolution of the client.
188
Third, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C), a person under common control with another person
solely because both persons are clients of a registered investment adviser would not aggregate
their trading activities and volume to determine if each meet the Proposed Rules, unless those
accounts constitute a parallel account structure. The Proposed Rules would define parallel
account structure to mean “a structure in which one or more private funds (each a ‘parallel
fund’), accounts, or other pools of assets (each a ‘parallel managed account’) managed by the
same investment adviser pursue substantially the same investment objective and strategy and
invest side by side in substantially the same positions as another parallel fund or parallel
managed account.”189 The aggregation provisions would require clients of a registered
investment adviser that are determined to be under “common control” of the registered
investment adviser to aggregate their trading activities under certain circumstances. As noted
above, in many instances, a registered investment adviser’s clients are engaged in independent
investment objectives and strategies and no individual client is engaged in trading activities for
the benefit of any other client. As a result, in the absence of the proposed exclusion, questions
 188 Id. Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) reflects the definition of control under Exchange Act Rule
13h-l. See 17 CFR 240.13h-l(a)(3).
189 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(b)(4) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(b)(4). The proposed definition
of “parallel account structure” corresponds to definitions of “parallel fund structure” and
“parallel managed account” under Form PF. See Form PF Glossary of Terms, available
at https://www.sec.gov/files/formpf.pdf.
84
could arise whether clients who would not otherwise be scoped into the Proposed Rules either
because of their individual trading activities or their trading activities for the economic benefit of
any other client, could nevertheless be captured by the Proposed Rules as a result of having to
aggregate their trading activities with those of other clients. To reduce the potential for capturing
these registered investment adviser clients in these circumstances, we are proposing to exclude
from the proposed requirement to aggregate trading activities of clients of a registered
investment adviser that are under common control solely because both are clients of the same
registered investment adviser.190
At the same time, however, the Proposed Rules are designed to prevent a registered
investment adviser from dividing trading activities among multiple clients to avoid the
application of the Proposed Rules. A registered investment adviser could, for example, create a
parallel fund structure in which one or more private funds pursue substantially the same
investment objective and strategy and invest side by side in substantially the same positions as
another private fund. The registered investment adviser could limit the trading activity of each
“parallel fund” so that individually it does not meet the qualitative or quantitative standards, even
though the funds’ trading activities in the aggregate are part of a single trading strategy. To
prevent such potential structuring of funds to avoid dealer registration, the proposed exclusion
would not apply to client accounts that constitute a parallel account structure.
191
Finally, it is important to note that, as discussed above, while a person that meets the
qualitative or quantitative standards in paragraph (a) is not subject to the Proposed Rules if that
 190 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(b)(2)(ii)(C) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(b)(2)(ii)(C).
191 Id.
85
person has or controls total assets less than $50 million,192 the accounts of such under-$50-
million persons must be considered for purposes of determining whether another person’s trading
activities or volume falls within the qualitative or quantitative standards set forth in paragraph
(a). In particular, a person must consider for aggregation purposes any accounts (including those
under $50 million) that are controlled by, or under common control with, that person. The
Commission believes that requiring aggregation of accounts of those persons that have or control
less than $50 million in total assets would prevent the organizing of corporate structures for the
purpose of avoiding dealer registration.
The following examples illustrate the application of the Proposed Rules’ definition of
“own account” as discussed above. In these examples, whether any of the firms’ relationship
and activities meet the definition of “control” would remain a facts and circumstances
determination. Additionally, as discussed in Section III.E, although a firm may not meet the
Proposed Rule’s definition of dealer or government securities dealer in the examples, the firm
may be a dealer or government securities dealer pursuant to existing Commission interpretations
and precedent to the extent consistent with the Proposed Rules.
Example 1
• A, B, and C are under common control; all are controlled by D. A, B, C, and D are all
limited liability companies. None of the firms are registered brokers, dealers, government
securities dealers, or registered investment companies.
Aggregation by Parent D
◦ D would aggregate the trading activities and volume of A, B, C, and D to determine if D
would be captured by paragraph (a) of the Proposed Rules. If as a result of this aggregation, D

192 See Section III.A; proposed Rule 3a5-4(a)(2)(i) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(3)(i).
86
meets the quantitative or qualitative standards of paragraph (a), and it has or controls more than
$50 million in total assets, it would be captured by the Proposed Rules.
Aggregation by D’s Subsidiaries
◦ A, B, and C would also need to aggregate each other’s trading activities and volume to
determine if they would individually be captured by the qualitative or quantitative standards of
paragraph (a) of the Proposed Rules. If, as a result of aggregation A, B, and C each meet the
qualitative or quantitative standards of paragraph (a), but A has or owns less than $50 million in
total assets, A would be excluded from the Proposed Rules under paragraph (a). A’s activities
and volume, however, would still be considered for purposes of B, C, and D.
◦ If B registers as a dealer, its trading activities and volume would no longer be
considered by A, C, or D.
Example 2
• A is a registered investment adviser with clients B, C, D, E, F, and G. A has an
investment advisory contract with each of B and C under which A exercises investment
discretion with respect to B’s and C’s assets each in an account separately managed by A. D and
E are hedge funds. A is the general partner of both D and E, and controls D and E as a result of
its capital contributions to and rights to amounts upon dissolution of each fund. F and G are also
hedge funds. A has an investment advisory contract with each of F and G under which A
exercises investment discretion with respect to F’s and G’s assets. F and G pursue substantially
the same investment objective and strategy and invest side by side in substantially the same
positions. Neither A nor any of its clients is a registered broker, dealer, government securities
dealer, or registered investment company.
Aggregation by A
87
◦ A would not need to aggregate its trading activities with the trading activities of B, C, F,
or G unless A controls B, C, F, or G as a result of the right to vote or direct the vote of the voting
securities issued by these clients, the right to sell or direct the sale of the voting securities issued
by these clients, or the amount of capital contributions to or rights to amounts upon these clients’
dissolution.
◦ A would need to aggregate its trading activities with the trading activities of both D and
E because A has control over each fund as a result of its capital contributions to and rights to
amounts upon dissolution of each fund.
Aggregation by A’s Clients
◦ B and C would not need to aggregate their trading activities even if B and C were
determined to be under common control (which would be a facts and circumstances
determination), because common control would be solely because both are clients of A.
◦ D and E would need to aggregate their trading activities because they are under
common control of A, which has the right to direct the vote of the voting securities of each fund
and the right to capital contributions upon dissolution of the fund and not solely because each
fund is a client of A.
◦ Each of F and G would need to aggregate the trading activities of the other fund. F and
G’s activities would constitute a parallel account structure (even if they are under common
control solely because both F and G are clients of A) because F and G are managed by the same
investment adviser, pursue substantially the same investment objective and strategy and invest
side by side in substantially the same positions as another parallel fund or parallel managed
account.
88
The Commission believes that the definitions of own account and control are appropriate
and will help to ensure that there is no circumvention of the Proposed Rules through, for
example, the establishment of multiple legal entities whose activities may not separately rise to a
level of engagement that qualifies for dealer or government dealer status, but, when aggregated,
does demonstrate that the entities are selling and buying securities or government securities as a
part of a regular business.
Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comment on this aspect of the Proposed Rules. In
addition, the Commission requests comment on the following specific issues:
30. Does the proposed definition of “own account” appropriately reflect complexities
and differences in corporate structures and business models of proprietary trading
firms, investment advisers, private funds, and other market participants, and the
ownership structures of their trading accounts? Why or why not? Commenters
should provide descriptions to support their responses.
31. Except as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii), are there instances when an account of
a controlled person, or person under common control, should not be considered a
person’s “own account” for purposes of the Proposed Rules? For example,
should an account held in the name of a bank be excluded from the definition of
“own account”? Commenters should provide descriptions of any such instances.
32. Is the proposed definition of “control” appropriate? What is the effect of using
the Exchange Act definition of “control”, as opposed to the Investment Company
Act definition? Please describe potential alternative definitions and why they are
more appropriate.
89
33. Are there instances where two entities may meet the proposed definition of
“control” and where these entities are in different lines of business and/or
unaware of the other’s trading strategies? Are there any situations where two
entities may meet the proposed definition of “control” but communications
between two entities would be prohibited?
34. Under the Proposed Rules, a registered investment adviser would aggregate its
account with its client accounts (private funds and separately managed accounts),
except as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
• Should registered investment advisers be included only with respect to their
own proprietary trading activities (i.e., not with respect to activities that could
be attributed to them by the aggregation contemplated by the definitions of
“own account” and “control”)? Why or why not?
• How would such aggregated accounts comply with the requirements for
dealer registration?
• In these cases, would the investment adviser registering itself avoid
registering a private fund or separately managed account client? If not, are
there other actions these accounts would seek to take to avoid all such
accounts either registering as dealers or ceasing investment strategies that
trigger the Proposed Rules application? Would any of such accounts avoid
certain investment strategies to prevent application of the Proposed Rules? If
so, which investment strategies and at which types of accounts?
• Would the registered investment adviser restructure its activities or those of
its private fund or separately managed account clients to avoid registering a
90
private fund or separately managed account client as a dealer? For example,
would a registered investment adviser create an affiliated broker-dealer to
avoid registering itself and/or any clients as dealers? What would be the
effects of any restructuring? Please explain.
35. Should the Proposed Rules require registered investment advisers to aggregate
client accounts when the adviser controls a person other than through an
ownership interest? Why or why not? We understand that, for tax and other
purposes, hedge fund offshore companies are often controlled by boards of
directors or legal entities that are separate from the hedge fund’s adviser. Should
the aggregation provisions of the Proposed Rules cover those arrangements? Will
the exclusion in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) have different impacts on registered
investment adviser client funds that are organized domestically as general
partnerships and funds that are organized offshore as companies with independent
directors? If so, could registered investment advisers restructure certain funds to
avoid application of the Proposed Rules? What would be the effects of any
restructuring? Would a registered investment adviser’s use of an omnibus
account to trade client securities on an aggregate basis present particular
interpretative questions or raise operational issues for these purposes?
36. Should registered investment adviser clients that are under common control solely
because they are clients of the same registered investment adviser be required to
aggregate accounts? Why or why not? Does the definition of “parallel control
structure” adequately capture ways in which a registered investment adviser could
seek to separate trading activities among accounts to avoid registration by their
91
clients? Would the aggregation provisions of the Proposed Rules appropriately
capture activity that would raise the concerns that the Proposed Rules are
designed to address? Would the aggregation provisions of the Proposed Rules
capture activity that it should not? If so, please explain.
37. Are there any incentives created by the aggregation provisions that may cause
market participants to reevaluate or restructure their corporate structures? What
costs and benefits are there associated with restructuring?
38. Would market participants exit certain strategies or exit the market to avoid
registration? If so, what would be the effects?
E. No Presumption
The Proposed Rules would further define the phrase “as a part of a regular business” by
identifying certain activities that would cause persons engaging in such activities to be “dealers”
or “government securities dealers” within the meaning of Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the
Exchange Act.193 They would not seek to address all persons that may be acting as dealers or
government securities dealers under otherwise applicable interpretations and precedent.
194 A
person that does not meet the conditions set forth in the Proposed Rules may nonetheless be a
 193 As discussed above, each qualitative standard in proposed Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2 is a
separate definition that further defines when a person is acting as a dealer or government
securities dealer. See Section III.B. Accordingly, a person would register with the
Commission if it satisfied any one of the three qualitative standards. Id. Similarly, the
quantitative standard in proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(2) is a discrete definition and a person
would register as a government securities dealer upon meeting this standard even if it did
not satisfy any of the qualitative standards in proposed Rule 3a44-2(a)(1). See Section
III.C.
194 See supra note 87; see, e.g., 2002 Release at 67499 (stating that “[a]s developed over the
years, the dealer/trader distinction recognizes that dealers normally . . . hold themselves
our as buying and selling securities at a regular place of business”).
92
dealer if it is otherwise engaged in a regular business of buying and selling securities for its own
account by, for example, acting as an underwriter.195
To emphasize this point, the Proposed Rules would state that no presumption shall arise
that a person is not a dealer or government securities dealer as defined by the Exchange Act
solely because that person does not satisfy paragraph (a) of the Proposed Rules. Proposed Rules
3a5-4(c) and 3a44-2(c) thus would provide that a person may still meet the statutory definition of
dealer and government securities dealer even absent the activity identified in paragraph (a) of the
Proposed Rules if the person is otherwise engaged in buying and selling securities or government
securities for its own account as a part of a regular business.
196
IV. General Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comment on all aspects of the Proposed Rules. In
addition, the Commission requests comment on the following specific issues:
39. Are there standards of activity other than the standards under the Proposed Rules
that the Commission should apply in the context of analyzing dealer status? If so,
which standards and why?
40. Would the Proposed Rules capture persons that should not be regulated as
dealers? If so, who? Why would they be captured under the Proposed Rules, and
why is that not appropriate?
41. Are there any categories of persons that would not meet the Proposed Rules, yet
should be registered as dealers? Commenters should identify any such categories
 195 See 2002 Release at 67499.
196 See proposed Rule 3a5-4(c) and proposed Rule 3a44-2(c).
93
of persons and describe why they should be registered despite not meeting the
proposed thresholds.
42. Would the Proposed Rules cause market participants to reevaluate or restructure
their activities to avoid registration as a dealer or cease investment strategies that
trigger the application of the Proposed Rules? What would be the effects of such
restructuring, withdrawal, or cessation? Please explain.
43. For purposes of determining whether a person is a dealer, are there significant
differences between equity securities, government securities, or other securities
that should be addressed by the Proposed Rules? Commenters should identify
and discuss any such differences.
44. Would the Proposed Rules appropriately apply the requirements applicable to
dealers (e.g., capital, margin, and business conduct requirements) to the entities
that would be subject to those requirements? Is the scope of the Proposed Rules
appropriate in light of the costs and benefits associated with those substantive
rules?
45. How are each of PTFs, hedge funds, and investment advisers typically
capitalized? Would the requirement of the Net Capital Rule (Exchange Act Rule
15c3-1) deter any of these entities from registering? Would the Net Capital Rule
cause these entities to alter trading activity that would trigger the rules’
application?
46. Would a pension plan or other institutional investor that rebalances its portfolio be
captured by the Proposed Rules? Please explain how. If so, should the rule
94
specifically exclude periodic portfolio rebalancing (e.g., on a monthly or quarterly
basis) from the concept of “as a part of a regular business?” Why or why not?
47. Should the Commission view rebalancing differently if it occurs only at a certain
frequency or by certain institutional investors? Why or why not?
48. Are there any other terms used in the Proposed Rules that the Commission should
define? Why or why not? Please identify what term(s) and how the term(s)
should be defined.
49. Should the Proposed Rules include an anti-evasion provision similar to Rule 13hl(c)(2), and why?
50. Will the Proposed Rules appropriately account for trading activity occurring
through sponsored access arrangements? Is there anything more that the
Commission should address regarding how such Proposed Rules will interrelate
with such arrangements?
51. If the Proposed Rules are adopted, which staff letters, if any, should or should not
be withdrawn, and why?
52. Are there additional standards, consistent with the Commission’s objectives, that
should be incorporated into the Proposed Rules? Commenters should identify and
discuss any such standards.
53. Are there any additional factors that the Commission should address in relation to
the Proposed Rules?
54. Are there any alternative approaches to the Proposed Rules that the Commission
should propose? Commenters should identify any such alternative approach and
describe the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative approach.
95
55. Other than what is discussed herein, are there any costs of compliance with the
Proposed Rules that the Commission has not addressed? Commenters should
describe any additional costs of compliance with the proposed rule and include
any empirical data, to the extent available.
56. The Commission is proposing a one-year compliance period from the effective
date of any final rules if adopted. Would the proposed compliance period provide
sufficient time for market participants to comply with the Proposed Rules? Why
or why not?
V. Economic Analysis
A. Introduction
The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects of its rules, including the costs and
benefits and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Section 3(f) of the
Exchange Act requires the Commission, whenever it engages in rulemaking pursuant to the
Exchange Act and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether
the action would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.197 In addition,
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when making rules under the
Exchange Act, to consider the effect such rules would have on competition.198 Exchange Act
Section 23(a)(2) prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden
 197 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
198 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
96
on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act.199
The Commission believes the Proposed Rules will support orderly markets and protect
investors by addressing negative externalities that may arise in relation to market participants’
financial and operational risks. The Proposed Rules would also improve transparency in
markets. Specifically, the Commission believes the Proposed Rules would promote the financial
and operational resilience of individual liquidity providers in securities markets and would
improve the Commission’s ability to monitor market activity, conduct research, and detect
manipulation and fraud. The Proposed Rules would have uncertain impacts on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation, due to the likelihood of offsetting effects. As discussed
further below, the Proposed Rules may create a more level competitive landscape by applying
similar rules to all activities that meet the proposed standards, and they may also promote market
efficiency and capital formation by strengthening market stability and investor protection.
However, offsetting effects could arise due to costs that the Proposed Rules would impose on
activities that provide liquidity.
Any person whose activities satisfy the qualitative or quantitative standards would be
affected by the Proposed Rules. The list of affected parties would primarily include PTFs, but
private funds may also be affected. Registered investment advisers may be affected if their own
proprietary trading activity triggers the application of the Proposed Rules or if they have certain
control over client accounts (including private funds and separately managed accounts) that,
individually or collectively, engage in activities that satisfy the Proposed Rules. However, the
Proposed Rules’ aggregation provisions exclude an account held in the name of a client of the

199 Id.
97
registered investment adviser unless the adviser controls the client as a result of the adviser’s
right to vote or direct the vote of voting securities of the client, the adviser’s right to sell or direct
the sale of voting securities of the client, or the adviser’s capital contributions to or rights to
amounts upon dissolution of the client.
200 Registered investment companies would be excluded
from the Proposed Rules, along with all persons that have or control assets of less than $50
million, as described below. Other parties who may be indirectly affected include the
competitors, customers or clients (if any), and creditors (if any) of the above-mentioned affected
parties.
B. Baseline
Dealers perform an important market function, absorbing order imbalances and providing
liquidity to buyers and sellers who may not arrive at the same time, and a regulatory regime
exists to govern their activities. However, market participants that do not register as dealers—
and so are not required to comply with the dealer regulatory regime—increasingly perform
similar economic functions as dealers. This difference in regulatory treatment creates the
potential for negative externalities, as described below. Furthermore, the unevenness of
regulation potentially places a greater burden on registered dealers than on other market
participants that engage in similar activities, which may allow market participants not registered
as dealers to gain market share from registered dealers.
1. Regulatory Baseline
Dealers, unless excepted or exempted, are required to register with the Commission,
201
join an SRO, and adhere to a comprehensive regulatory regime. As discussed above in
 200 See supra note 185 and associated text.
201 As of August 2, 2021, 3,559 firms were registered with the Commission as broker-
98
Section II, this regime includes provisions that limit risk (e.g., the Net Capital Rule and rules
promoting operational integrity), books and records requirements,
202 various reporting and
disclosure requirements,
203 and dealer-specific anti-manipulative and other anti-fraud rules.204
The Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) requires registered dealers to maintain minimum amounts of
net liquid assets at all times, even intraday, thus constraining dealer leverage.205 In addition to
the financial and regulatory risk management controls required by the Market Access Rule,
broker-dealers with market access must comply with a number of underlying regulatory
requirements when conducting their business.206 Registered dealers are also subject to the
Commission’s authority to conduct examinations and impose sanctions,
207 and to the
examination and enforcement authority of the relevant SRO.208 Government securities dealers

dealers. See Data: Company Information About Active Broker-Dealers, SEC (updated
Feb. 1, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/help/foiadocsbdfoiahtm.html.
202 See supra note 79.
203 See supra note 77.
204 See supra note 80.
205 See supra note 76. Rule 15c3-1 requires dealers to maintain, at all times, net capital
above the greater of: a percentage of debt (6.25 percent, or 11.1 percent for 12 months
after commencing business as a broker or dealer), or a fixed minimum amount based on
the types of business in which the dealer engages (the general amount for dealers without
customers is $100,000).
206 These regulatory requirements include, for example, pre-trade requirements such as
exchange-trading rules relating to special order types, trading halts, odd-lot orders, and
SEC rules under Regulation SHO and Regulation NMS, as well as post-trade obligations
to monitor for manipulation and other illegal activity. Also see supra note 78 on the
Market Access Rule (15c3-5).
207 See supra note 82 and Section II.D.
208 Exchange Act Section 17(b) subjects broker-dealers to inspections and examinations by
Commission staff and by the relevant SRO. In addition, 17 CFR 240.15b2-2 (Exchange
Act Rule 15b2-2) generally requires the SRO that has responsibility for examining a
dealer member to inspect a newly registered dealer for compliance with applicable
financial responsibility rules within six months of registration, and for compliance with
99
are further subject to rules issued by the Treasury that concern financial responsibility, capital
requirements, recordkeeping, reports and audits, and large position reporting.209 Finally, since
registered dealers must join an SRO, they are bound by additional rules set by the SROs.210
Among other things, these rules help to ensure that dealers are financially responsible,
including adequately capitalized, that they maintain internal controls, and that the Commission
and the SROs have tools to help them detect manipulation or fraud by analyzing transaction
reports and examining other records kept by the dealer.
2. Other Market Participants
Market participants who are not registered as dealers also conduct significant activity in
securities markets,211 and the Commission believes that some of these entities nevertheless
perform the economic function of dealers. Because the Proposed Rules would apply to activities

all other regulatory requirements within 12 months of registration. See also 17 CFR
240.17d-1 (Exchange Act Rule 17d-1), Examination for compliance with applicable
financial responsibility rules. Thereafter, FINRA or another SRO, as applicable,
continues to inspect each firm periodically, based on the firm’s risk profile.
209 See supra note 81.
210 For example, see FINRA Rule 2010 (Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of
Trade); FINRA Rule 2020 (Use of Manipulative, Deceptive, or Other Fraudulent
Devices); and FINRA Rule 4510 Series (Books and Records Requirements). Other SROs
have comparable and sometimes equivalent rules. See, e.g., NYSE Rules, NYSE,
available at https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules, Rulebook – The Nasdaq Stock Market,
Nasdaq, available at https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules.
211 For fixed income securities, where TRACE data allow us to observe some of the activity
of non-dealers, we estimate that in July 2021 the combined volume of non-FINRA firms
accounted for approximately 45 percent of the volume of U.S. Treasury securities,
approximately 44 percent of the total corporate bond volume, and approximately 42
percent of the volume of agency pass-through mortgage backed securities (including
securities traded in specified pool transactions and securities traded to be announced).
While FINRA membership is not synonymous with dealer registration status, the
Commission believes that many non-FINRA entities are also not registered as dealers.
100
rather to persons’ legal descriptions or other characteristics, they could potentially capture a wide
array of persons.
212
The list of affected parties would not include persons who have or control assets less than
$50 million, and we estimate that this provision would exclude the majority of investors.213
Established FINRA rules distinguish retail investors from institutional investors, in part, based
on a threshold of $50 million in assets, and we follow that standard to exclude small investors
who are unlikely to conduct a significant degree of dealer-like activity.214 Certain financial
institutions may also be exempt from the Proposed Rules.215
The first two subsections below explain why we preliminarily believe that PTFs and
private funds, particularly hedge funds, are the most likely firms other than registered dealers to
be engaged in activities that would satisfy the Proposed Rules. As discussed above, the activities
of clients would not be attributed to a registered investment adviser for purposes of determining
whether the adviser would fall under the Proposed Rules, except in cases where (i) the adviser
controls the clients as a result of voting rights, capital contributions, or the rights to amounts
upon dissolution and (ii) the clients over which the registered adviser has such control
 212 Upon the adoption of any final rule, some letters and other staff statements, or portions
thereof, may be moot, superseded, or otherwise inconsistent with the final rules and,
therefore, would be withdrawn or modified. See supra note 41.
213 Most U.S. investors are households, and most household investors have less than $50
million in assets. The 2019 Survey of Consumer Finance, sponsored by the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors and the U.S. Treasury, shows that 68 million U.S. families
owned stocks and bonds, either directly or indirectly, and that 93 percent own less than
$1 million. The survey also showed that the mean (median) U.S. household had total
assets of $858,000 ($227,000). This number of household investors is much larger than
the number of institutional investors. For example, there are currently 16,127 registered
investment companies and 14,874 registered investment advisers.
214 See supra note 99.
215 See supra notes 9 and 29.
101
collectively engage in activities that satisfy the Proposed Rules. Therefore, registered investment
advisers would not fall under the Proposed Rules solely due to client activities over which the
adviser has investment discretion. Advisers may still fall under the Proposed Rules on the basis
of their own proprietary trading. The third subsection below discusses evidence regarding the
number of persons whose activities may satisfy the Proposed Rules. The final subsection covers
the Proposed Rules’ exclusion for registered investment companies.
a. Proprietary Trading Firms
PTFs have emerged as consequential players in securities markets. While some PTFs
have registered with the Commission, many others have not. Some studies of high-frequency
trading—a primary feature of PTF activity, according to the 2015 Joint Staff Report—show that
this activity may have positive effects on transaction costs and competition, while other studies
show that the net effects may be negative.
216 PTFs that are not registered with the Commission
are subject to the anti-manipulation and anti-fraud provisions under Securities Act Section 17(a)
and to Exchange Act Section 10(b), but they are not subject to the more targeted provisions
under Exchange Act Section 15(c), to examinations, to net capital requirements, or to various
reporting requirements that apply to dealers.
Because regulatory TRACE data pertaining to Treasury securities reported by certain
ATSs contains the identity of non-FINRA member trading parties, we are able to analyze PTFs’
importance in the U.S. Treasury market during July 2021217 and summarize the number and type
 216 For a survey of the literature, see, Albert J., 2016, The Economics of High-Frequency
Trading: Taking Stock, Annual Review of Financial Economics (8), 1-24. See also Baron,
Matthew, Jonathan Brogaard, Björn Hagströmer, and Andrei Kirilenko, 2019, Risk and
Return in High-Frequency Trading, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
54(3), 993-1024.
217 The analysis is limited to a subsection of TRACE data where the identity of trading
102
of market participants by monthly trading volume in Table 1 below.218 The analysis included
626 firms219 who were active in the U.S. Treasury market in July 2021, of which 452 were
FINRA members and 174 were not. While FINRA membership is not synonymous with dealer
registration status, we believe that many of the large participants in the U.S. Treasury market
who are not FINRA members are also not registered as dealers. The 174 identified non-FINRA
member firms in Table 1 accounted for approximately 19 percent of aggregate Treasury trading
volume in July 2021. PTFs had by far the highest volumes among identified non-FINRA
member participants in the U.S. Treasury market, and the largest PTFs had trading volumes that
were roughly comparable to the volumes of the largest dealers. A Federal Reserve staff analysis
found that PTFs were particularly active in the interdealer segment of the U.S. Treasury market
in 2019, accounting for 61 percent of the volume on automated interdealer broker platforms and
48 percent of the interdealer broker volume overall.220 Figure 1 also shows that non-FINRA
member firms in the U.S. Treasury market (most of which we believe are not dealers) have a
volume distribution that is comparable to the volume distribution of FINRA-members (most of

counterparties is known. In July 2021, approximately 58 percent of the non-FINRA
member volume in TRACE belonged to anonymous market participants. Non-FINRA
member participants generally appear anonymously when they trade with FINRA
members, who report their activity to TRACE but maintain the anonymity of the nonFINRA member counterparties. When non-FINRA member participants trade on an ATS
that is covered by FINRA Rule 6730.07, the ATS reports the transaction to TRACE along
with a unique, non-anonymous MPID for each counterparty.
218 TRACE identifies counterparties by MPIDs, of which an individual firm may have many.
The firm classification is based on an understanding of the individual firms’ businesses
(see also the 2015 Joint Staff Report at 50).
219 The analysis does not aggregate affiliated firms, but counts them separately, even though
they may be controlled by a common corporate parent. For example, if a firm were to
have a FINRA-member broker-dealer affiliate and a non-FINRA hedge fund affiliate, the
analysis would consider the broker-dealer and the hedge fund as separate firms.

TRACE” (Sept. 28, 2018).

whom are dealers). Based on PTFs’ high trading volumes, and on the Federal Reserve staff
finding that PTFs are particularly active in the interdealer segment of the U.S. Treasury market,
we believe that PTFs have emerged as de facto liquidity providers in the U.S. Treasury market.

Figure 1. Treasury Trading Volume Distributions of FINRA Members and non-FINRA
Members, July 2021
This figure plots the number and percentage of identifiable firms in TRACE data for July
2021, by size category. The plots are truncated on the right by grouping together all firms
with monthly volume of $100 billion or greater.
104
Since the analysis behind Table 1 is limited to the subset of TRACE data where we can
identify the individual firms,
221 the numbers of firms with trading volume above the various
thresholds may be greater than shown in the table. This is also to say that, were the data to
include all market participants, we would need higher thresholds to be able to report numbers of
firms similar to what are shown in the table. We make this adjustment as follows. In July 2021,
the analysis was able to determine the firm identity and FINRA membership status of 42 percent
of the non-FINRA member volume; the remaining 58 percent of non-FINRA member volume
was anonymous.222 Under the assumption that all non-FINRA member market participants are
equally represented in both the anonymous and identified subsets of TRACE, the analysis
equally undercounts the volume of all firms—i.e., we assume that our analysis only contains 42
percent of identified non-FINRA member firms’ volume. We acknowledge considerable
uncertainty regarding this assumption. The assumption of equal representation in the observed
and non-observed data suggests dividing the thresholds shown in Table 1 by 0.42 (or multiplying
them by approximately 2.5). For example, Table 1 shows that our analysis counted 46 nonFINRA member firms with trading volumes of at least $10 billion in July 2021; the adjustment
would suggest that those 46 firms actually had trading volumes of above $25 billion. However,
firms in the various categories may not be equally represented in the identified and anonymous
data. If, for example, PTFs are overrepresented in the identified data, then the actual number of
PTFs with volumes over $25 billion will be closer to 18 than to 22. We preliminarily estimate
 221 See supra note 217.
222 For each transaction, we consider each counterparty to be responsible for half of the
volume. Therefore, for a transactions where we observe the identity of only one
counterparty, we consider that we have only determined the firm identity and FINRA
membership for half of the transaction’s volume. We observe the identity of at least one
counterparty for all transactions in TRACE, since trades between non-FINRA member
firms are not reported to TRACE.
105
that approximately 46 non-FINRA member firms would surpass the $25 billion volume threshold
given in the quantitative standard of the Proposed Rules. Although the analysis behind Table 1
only uses data from July 2021, we find that the number of firms that would have surpassed the
$25 billion volume threshold in four out of the last six calendar months remained relatively
steady between 39 and 50 from September 2019 to July 2021, or the entire period for which data
was available. Non-FINRA member counterparties are first identified in TRACE beginning in
April 2019, so September 2019 is the first month in which we can count how many non-FINRA
member firms would surpass the quantitative threshold in four out of the last six calendar
months.
b. Private Funds
Private funds223 are prominent participants in U.S. securities markets. As of the second
quarter of 2021, the Commission observed the following types of private funds reported on Form
PF:
224
Table 2. Private Fund Statistics as of 2021Q2
Fund Type Count Gross Asset Value Net Asset Value
Total ($B) Avg ($mm) Total ($B) Avg ($mm)
Hedge Fund 9,613 9,584 997 5,132 534
Private Equity Fund 15,861 4,825 304 4,270 269
Venture Capital Fund 1,424 222 156 214 150
Liquidity Fund 76 330 4,342 319 4,197
Other Private Fund 10,557 3,041 288 2,167 205
Note: These statistics rely on Form PF. Only SEC-registered advisers with at least $150
million in private fund assets under management must report to the Commission on Form PF;
SEC-registered investment advisers with less than $150 million in private fund assets under
 223 See supra note 30.
224 See Division of Investment Management Analytics Office, SEC, Private Fund Statistics:
Second Calendar Quarter 2021 (Jan. 14, 2022), available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/private-funds-statistics/private-funds-statistics2021-q2.pdf
106
management, SEC exempt reporting advisers, and state-registered investment advisers are not
required to file Form PF.
Of the 9,613 hedge funds reported on Form PF, there were 1,968 qualifying hedge funds
that reported information on their positions, and these held $3.2 trillion in listed equities and $1.7
trillion in U.S. Government securities. Of the 76 liquidity funds, 56 liquidity funds reported
information on their positions, and these held $94.8 billion in U.S. Government securities and
$21.7 billion in asset-backed securities.
Among private funds, hedge funds are the most likely to be engaged in activities that
meet the Proposed Rules. As reported on Form PF, hedge funds and private equity funds are the
largest by count and aggregate assets, and hedge funds and liquidity funds are the largest by
average fund assets. However, the business models of private equity funds225 and liquidity
funds226 are unlikely to fall under the Proposed Rules’ qualitative factors, since they are
generally long-only investors that are not likely to routinely make roughly comparable purchases
and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day or to routinely quote markets to
capture bid-ask spreads. As described above, “routinely” in the Proposed Rules means both
repeatedly within a day (multiple times in a single day) and repeatedly over time (on the majority
of days in a calendar month). Regarding the quantitative volume standard, liquidity funds may
trade large volumes of U.S. Treasury securities, but the average reporting liquidity fund, as of the
second quarter of 2021, held only $1.7 billion of Treasury securities and held the average
 225 See Investor.gov, Private Equity Funds, available at
https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investmentproducts/private-investment-funds/private-equity.
226 See D. Hiltgen, “Private Liquidity Funds: Characteristics and Risk Indicators,” DERA
White Paper (Jan. 2017).
107
positions for 40-50 days.227 Such a fund is unlikely to regularly trade $25 billion in U.S.
Treasury securities in a month.
An important similarity between private funds and PTFs is the incentives involved for
those making trading and investment decisions. PTFs, as the name implies, invest money for the
principals, who then benefit directly from the trading gains. This is similar to many registered
dealers. Similarly, private fund advisers, including their affiliates that operate as general partners
of private funds, typically have a compensation arrangement by which they receive a significant
portion of gains (often 20 percent). In both cases, these compensation arrangements may
incentivize aggressive trading.
Certain hedge funds, on the other hand, may satisfy either the qualitative or the
quantitative standards of the Proposed Rules, or both. The remainder of this section discusses
whether current hedge fund activity may meet the standards, and describes regulations that
currently apply to registered hedge fund advisers. The qualitative standards could potentially
capture certain hedge fund trading strategies, such as those that may involve automated or highfrequency buying and selling of substantially similar securities in the same day. It is also
possible that a large hedge fund could trade sufficient volumes of U.S. Treasury securities to
satisfy the quantitative standard. The extent to which hedge funds may satisfy these standards is
uncertain. Hedge funds do not report their transactions, so they are not currently identifiable in
CAT data or in TRACE data (beyond the subset of U.S. Treasury TRACE discussed
previously).228 Structured data are not available that would indicate how many hedge funds
 227 See supra note 224, figures 18–19.
228 See supra note 169. Regarding CAT data availability, hedge funds are currently not
identifiable because CAT Firm Designated ID (“FDID”) numbers do not map to brokerdealers’ customers. Starting in July 2022, CAT data will identify broker-dealers’
customers, including hedge funds.
108
would satisfy the qualitative standards, but some hedge fund strategies would likely do so. We
observe at least one hedge fund (number suppressed in Table 1 above) that surpassed the
quantitative standard’s threshold of $25 billion in U.S. Treasuries in July 2021. Additional hedge
funds may meet the quantitative threshold beyond those we observe—for instance, hedge funds
who trade outside of covered ATSs and so only appear in TRACE anonymously, or hedge funds
that trade with other non-FINRA members (such as banks) and so do not appear in TRACE at
all.
One hedge fund strategy that stands out is the Treasury basis trade,229 as one study
estimated that approximately 65 percent of hedge funds’ total Treasury exposure was tied to the
basis trade before March, 2020.230 A hedge fund’s basis trade is not likely to satisfy the
qualitative standards of the Proposed Rules, because a futures contract and a Treasury of similar
maturity would not qualify as substantially similar securities since the futures contract is not a
security. Also, since transactions associated with repurchase agreements would not count toward
the Proposed Rules’ quantitative standard, most hedge funds’ basis trading would likely not
satisfy that standard. A large-volume basis trading hedge fund could hypothetically be captured
by the quantitative standard, but a recent study suggests that few, if any, basis trades involve
enough Treasury trading volume to meet the threshold of $25 billion per month in four out of the
past six calendar months.231 In 2019, when the basis trade was more attractive than at present,
 229 In a long Treasury basis trade, participants take a long position in Treasury securities and
a short position in Treasury futures, and then profit from the eventual convergence of
cash and futures prices toward the delivery date. Hedge funds typically post the Treasury
securities as collateral for repo funding.
230 See Barth, Daniel, and R. Jay Kahn, “Hedge Funds and the Treasury Cash-Futures
Disconnect,” OFR Working Paper 21-01 (Apr. 1, 2021).
231 See id.
109
the study reported that the aggregate basis trade of the 44 largest participants held a long
Treasury position of about $400–$500 billion (an average of only about $9–$11 billion per large
basis trader). Furthermore, the basic strategy of the basis trade involves holding Treasury
securities to the earlier of: (i) maturity; or (ii) a time when the basis trade is no longer attractive.
As described above in Section III.A, the Commission is mindful that registered private
fund advisers are currently regulated under the Advisers Act, and that advisers’ requirements
under the Advisers Act affect the activities of private funds. This regulatory regime includes
anti-fraud measures applicable to all advisers and requires that many private fund advisers
register with the Commission. The Advisers Act establishes reporting and recordkeeping
requirements for registered advisers to private funds for investment protection and systemic risk
purposes. Specifically, Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act requires registered investment
advisers to keep certain books and records (records of the advised private funds are considered
records of the adviser for these purposes), and Section 206 subjects registered investment
advisers to several anti-fraud provisions, including antifraud liability with respect to current and
prospective clients. Registered investment advisers also have fiduciary duties, which comprise a
duty of care and a duty of loyalty.232 Certain registered investment advisers must also submit
annual and, for certain large advisers to certain large hedge funds, quarterly reports to the
Commission,233 and they are subject to Commission examinations.
 232 See Commission Interpretation Regarding Standard of Conduct for Investment Advisers,
Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5248 (June 5, 2019) 84 FR 33669 (July 12, 2019),
at 24-25.
233 These reports are submitted through Form PF, which was adopted in 2011 as required by
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Pub. L. 111-
203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). See Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and
Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF,

I.
110
Differences between the regulatory regime that applies to registered advisers to private
funds and the one that applies to securities dealers include leverage constraints, and reporting.
Registered dealers’ leverage is limited by net capital requirements, which must be maintained at
all times, even intraday, while private funds have no formal leverage constraints. Private funds
also do not report their securities transactions. Their fixed-income transactions do not appear in
TRACE, or may appear anonymously as part of the reporting obligation of broker-dealers.
Transactions in fixed-income securities other than municipal securities and U.S. Treasury
securities are reported to TRACE and publicly disseminated (transactions in U.S. Treasury
securities are reported to regulatory TRACE but not publicly disseminated), so markets have
more post-trade transparency with regards to registered dealers than with regards to private
funds. Private funds’ transactions in national market system (“NMS”) stocks, OTC equities, and
listed options already appear in CAT, but some additional information is only available for firms
that report directly to CAT. For example, currently, when a PTF sends orders to a broker-dealer,
CAT will include the timestamp indicating when the order was received by the broker-dealer, but
not the timestamps indicating when the order was originated or routed by the PTF. Additionally,
if the PTF originates a larger order and splits it into smaller orders for routing to the brokerdealer, CAT will only include the smaller orders as they are received by the broker-dealer, but
CAT will not include the larger order as originated. Regulators may be able to obtain more
complete data on private funds’ pre- and post-trade securities trading activity through
examinations, but such information is more readily available for registered dealers.
c. Number of Affected Parties
The precise number of affected parties is uncertain, since existing data does not provide a
clear picture of all market participants’ activities. For instance, we do not know how many PTFs
111
routinely express trading interests that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the
market. Nevertheless, the discussion in this section seeks to provide some idea, based on
available data, of the Proposed Rules’ scope. First, we provide data on the number of entities that
may satisfy the first qualitative factor by “routinely making roughly comparable purchases and
sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day.” The analysis requires us to assume
a particular functional form for this qualitative standard, but we do not mean to imply that the
standard would be defined this way in practice. For the highest-volume U.S. Treasury security in
July 2021 (the 10-year on-the-run note, with 15 percent of total U.S. Treasury volume), we
compute a buy-sell volume imbalance for each firm and for each trading day as |B-S|/(B+S),
where B is the firm’s daily buy volume and S is the firm’s daily sell volume. A low buy-sell
imbalance indicates purchases and sales in more similar dollar amounts. We then repeat the
analysis for the highest-volume security in equity markets in October 2021 (the SPDR S&P 500
ETF, or “SPY”, with 6.1 percent of the total volume of NMS stocks234).
For the U.S. Treasury market, Table 3 shows the number of non-FINRA member firms,
by firm type, that had a “low” buy-sell volume imbalance—below 10 percent or, alternatively,
below 20 percent—for at least 14 of the 21 trading days in July 2021. Twenty non-FINRA
member firms had a buy-sell volume imbalance of less than 20 percent in at least 14 of 21
trading days and 15 non-FINRA member firms had a buy-sell volume imbalance of less than 10
percent in at least 14 of 21 trading days. All of these firms were PTFs.235
 234 For SPY volume, we use data from Intraday Indicators Aggregate Market Liquidity -
WRDS. We rely on CBOE statistics for the total dollar volume of NMS stocks. See U.S.
Equities Market Volume Summary, CBOE, available at
https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/.
235 See supra note 218.

Notes: 1. Buy-sell volume imbalance = |B-S|/B+S, where B is firm’s daily
buy volume and S is firm’s daily sell volume. 2. The Treasury CUSIP with
the highest volume in July 2021 is for 10-year on-the-run Treasury note. In
July 2021, the total volume for this CUSIP was about 15 percent of the total
volume for all Treasury securities. 3. * Suppressed; at least 1 firm of each
type exists in the data (all suppressed numbers in the first column are
greater than zero).
A comparison of these 15 or 20 firms with the list of 46 firms (see Table 1) that had total
monthly Treasury-trading volume of more than $10 billion236 in July 2021 revealed considerable
overlap between first qualitative standard and the qualitative standard: 17 of the 20 non-FINRA
member PTFs with frequent buy-sell volume imbalance of less than 20 percent in Table 3 also
had monthly volume greater than $10 billion in Table 1; 14 of the 15 non-FINRA member PTFs
with frequent buy-sell volume imbalance of less than 10 percent in Table 3 also had monthly
volume greater than $10 billion in Table 1.
 236 As discussed above, we believe that the $10 billion threshold in our analysis, which is
limited to the subsection of TRACE where we can verify traders’ identities, corresponds
to the Proposed Rules’ quantitative threshold of $25 billion.
113
The analysis for the equity market relied on CAT data. While PTFs and private funds do
not directly report to CAT, their trades in NMS stocks, OTC equity securities, and listed options
are reported to CAT by registered broker-dealers with whom they interact as customers (e.g., by
trading through a registered broker-dealer or with a registered broker-dealer, including with an
ATS). Specifically, for the original receipt or origination of an order, registered broker-dealers
report to CAT the Firm Designated ID (“FDID”), which is then assigned to various other CAT
order events in the order lifecycle. These CAT FDIDs uniquely identify trading accounts of
registered broker-dealers and can represent firm or customer accounts. Firm trading accounts
include market-making accounts and other proprietary accounts of the registered broker-dealer.
Customer accounts include mainly institutional customer accounts and individual customer
accounts, but they also include customer average-price accounts and employee accounts where
an employee of the registered broker-dealer is exercising discretion over multiple customer
accounts.
Because the activity of all market participants is captured in CAT FDID customer
accounts and because the Proposed Rules do not cover persons with total assets of less than $50
million, in our analysis of SPY we focused on CAT FDID institutional customer accounts.
Specifically, we computed buy-sell dollar volume imbalance for each CAT FDID institutional
customer account and each trading day in October 2021. As in our analysis of Treasuries, we
defined buy-sell volume imbalance as |B-S|/(B+S), where B is the firm’s daily buy volume and S
is the firm’s daily sell volume. We also computed the total (i.e., buy plus sell) dollar volume in
SPY for each CAT FDID institutional customer account and each trading day in October 2021.
Table 4 shows the number of CAT FDID institutional customer accounts that had both (i)
a “low” buy-sell dollar volume imbalance in SPY and (ii) total buy plus sell dollar volume in
114
SPY above a de minimis threshold, in at least 14 of 21 trading days in October 2021. We again
define “low” to mean less than 10 percent or less than 20 percent. We include the de minimis
threshold to remove small entities that are the most likely to be excluded from the Proposed
Rules for having less than $50 million in assets.237 Table 4 shows results for two alternate de
minimis thresholds: $10,000 per day or $100,000 per day. In addition to the number of CAT
FDID institutional customer accounts that satisfied these criteria, Table 4 also shows the
combined dollar volume of these accounts as percent of total SPY dollar volume in October
2021.

Notes: 1. Buy-sell volume imbalance = |B-S|/B+S, where B is firm’s daily buy volume and S
is firm’s daily sell volume. 2. There were a total of 21,115 CAT FDID institutional customer
accounts that traded SPY in October 2021. A CAT FDID “institutional customer account” is
an institutional account as defined in FINRA rule 4512I. See supra note [26] for further
details.
 237 We did not discuss a de minimis threshold in the previous analysis for the U.S. Treasury
market (see supra Table 3), because imposing a volume threshold even as high as $1
million did not affect the count of firms that had low-imbalance and above de minimis
trading on each of 14 out of 21 days.
115
The results in Table 4 indicate that between 41 and 61 CAT FDID institutional customer
accounts (depending on the thresholds used) had both low buy-sell dollar volume imbalance in
SPY and above de minimis total dollar volume in SPY in at least 14 of 21 trading days in
October 2021, and the combined dollar volume of these accounts represented between 3.3
percent and 6.3 percent of total SPY dollar volume in October 2021. If the entities behind these
accounts are not excluded or otherwise exempted, such trading activity could satisfy the
qualitative standard of “routinely making roughly comparable purchases and sales of the same or
substantially similar securities in a day.”
The precise number of affected parties is highly uncertain, due to several shortcomings.
The U.S. Treasury market analysis has the following caveats. First, we only analyze the buy-sell
imbalance within a single CUSIP, though firms could potentially satisfy the standard based on
other CUSIPs or on a combination of CUSIPs (the qualitative standard includes trading in either
the “same” or “substantially similar” securities). Second, we do not observe the universe of U.S.
Treasury trading. Third, this analysis imposes quantitative cutoffs in place of the qualitative
standard, which is “roughly comparable purchases and sales.” Due to the first two shortcomings,
the actual number of parties affected by this qualitative standard may be higher than the 15 or 20
firms we estimate here. The third shortcoming introduces additional uncertainty, since we do not
know whether the cutoffs assumed in the analysis—buy-sell imbalance less than 10 percent or 20
percent in at least 14 of 21 trading days—would align with the qualitative standard in all cases.
There are also caveats to the equity market analysis, as follows. First, there is currently
no one-to-one correspondence between CAT FDID accounts and firms (although such
information will be available starting in July 2022). Some market participants may have several
CAT FDID institutional customer accounts, and some CAT FDID institutional customer
116
accounts may represent more than one customer. Therefore, the number of CAT FDID
institutional customer accounts that satisfy various thresholds in Table 4 does not necessarily
equal the number of market participants that would satisfy the qualitative standard of “routinely
making roughly comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in
a day.” Furthermore, some of the CAT FDID institutional customer accounts that satisfy various
thresholds in Table 4 may represent investments companies registered under the Investment Act,
which are excluded from the Proposed Rules.
Despite these caveats, we believe that the results in Tables 3 and 4 provide useful
indications about the scope of the Proposed Rules in the markets for U.S. Treasury securities and
NMS stocks.
3. Externalities
When market participants who effectively provide liquidity do not comply with existing
dealer regulations, including rules specifically designed to limit risk-taking and to deter
manipulative or fraudulent behavior, the probability of behaviors that are financially risky,
manipulative, or fraudulent increases. As described below, such behavior on the part of one firm
may create negatively externalities on other firms. Although all liquidity providers are subject to
Exchange Act Section 17(a), Section 10(b), and 17 CFR 240.10b-10 (Rule 10b-10 thereunder),
liquidity providers that are not registered as dealers currently have more regulatory allowance to
accept operational or financial risk. For example, net capital requirements limit the leverage that
dealers are allowed to take on, while PTFs and private funds have no regulatory leverage
constraints. We estimate that qualifying hedge funds are more leveraged than registered dealers.
As of the second quarter of 2021, registered investment advisers reported that qualifying hedge
funds had $1.4 trillion in assets that could be liquidated within a day, $3.4 trillion in assets that
117
could be liquidated within a year, and $3.6 trillion in secured debts, so that qualifying hedge
funds’ aggregate secured debt obligations appear much higher than their aggregate liquid
assets.238 In contrast, the Net Capital Rule requires dealers to have highly liquid assets in excess
of unsubordinated debt.239 We are unable to estimate PTFs’ leverage due to data limitations.
PTFs and private funds also may not have the same obligations as dealers to implement
operational risk controls.240 In addition, PTFs are not subject to any examination or reporting
requirements, and neither PTFs nor private funds are required to report securities transactions.
Even though all market participants face incentives to remain solvent and profitable,
certain market participants may not bear all the costs of their failure. Therefore, they may not
have sufficient incentive to ensure their ability to weather adverse shocks. When entities have
leverage, for example, creditors may bear some of the costs of failure. As another example,
entities that perform a significant share of liquidity provision may disrupt market trading if they
fail, thus imposing costs on other entities.
These incentives, or lack of incentives, create externalities that market forces alone
cannot resolve. A market participant who is unable to meet its obligations may harm its
creditors, other financial institutions related to its creditors, its trading counterparties, and other
participants in securities markets including investors. Although creditors can seek to estimate a
borrower’s probability of failure and price the credit extension accordingly, large losses can
 238 Using data from “Private Fund Statistics” (see supra note 228), we estimate qualifying
hedge funds’ net capitalization as highly liquid assets minus secured debt. Dollar values
of liquid assets are from Table 49 (portfolio liquidity for qualifying hedge funds as a
percent of aggregate net asset value) and Table 4 (net asset value), and the value of
secured debt is from Table 51 (borrowings of qualifying hedge funds).

potentially propagate through the financial system—especially when indirect exposures are not
well understood and financial firms misread their total exposure. Instability in securities markets
may appear when a failed liquidity provider exits the market or when a stressed liquidity
provider temporarily reduces its activity, thereby reducing market liquidity for all traders until
other liquidity providers can fill the gap. During the U.S. Treasury market volatility in March
2020, PTFs (most of whom are not registered as dealers) appeared to especially pull back from
market-making activity, possibly because “their lower capitalization relative to dealers may
[have left] them with less capacity to absorb adverse shocks.”241 Other research also shows that,
in equity markets, the presence of high-frequency traders can further reduce market liquidity
during periods of extreme volatility (high frequency is one of the primary features of PTF
activity, according to the 2015 Joint Staff Report).
242 Instability may also appear when a
struggling market participant rapidly exits a large position in one or more securities, leading to
volume and price spikes that can quickly push market prices away from fundamental values and
can overwhelm exchanges and clearing houses. The associated volatility may heighten the
inventory and operational risks of market participants throughout the securities markets. The
failure of a large market participant can potentially propagate instability across securities markets
if the failed entity actively trades many different asset classes simultaneously.
 241 See 2021 IAWG Joint Staff Report at 13. Initially, PTFs increased trading activity, but
they pulled back from market making several days later when volatility reached very high
levels. (“In the first week of March, a large share of the increased trading volume came
from PTFs, and on March 9, PTFs’ share of trading on electronic IDB platforms was just
over 60 percent, a typical level. But as heavy net investor sales continued, the balance of
activity in the interdealer market shifted…PTFs’ total share of activity fell to a low of 45
percent on March 16. Dealers’ total volumes on electronic IDB platforms also declined,
but less sharply than PTFs’ volumes.”)

As discussed above, the Commission and the SROs have established rules designed to
address the externalities related to financial stress, by promoting registered dealers’ financially
responsibility and operational capability. Specifically, the rules seek to minimize the disruptions
that can occur from losses related to operational risk. One risk is that a firm may not be able to
find offsetting trades, and so accumulates an unexpectedly large position that must be rapidly
liquidated at a loss. Another risk is that errors in trading algorithms or other systems (including
human errors) lead to an unexpectedly large position that must be rapidly liquidated at a loss.243
Since, as discussed above, losses on the part of one market participant can harm others, dealer
regulations are designed to mitigate the magnitude of these externalities and to reduce the
probability that they occur at all. However, these regulations do not currently apply to market
participants that are not registered as dealers. We do not have sufficient oversight to understand
what risk-management controls PTFs may have in place, how much leverage they use, or how
liquid their assets are. Private funds’ risk-taking may be constrained by their advisers’ fiduciary
duties, but, as described above, we believe that the average hedge fund is more leveraged than
the Net Capital Rule would allow (although we acknowledge the uncertainty around our
estimate).
The potential for market manipulation or fraud constitutes other negative externalities,
since such behavior may distort market prices or give the perpetrator unfair advantages over
 243 In 2012, an algorithm error at a single trader temporarily affected the prices of 150 stock
tickers, causing some to increase or decrease more than 30 percent versus the day’s
opening. See Knight Capital Americas LLC, Exchange Act Release No. 70694 (Oct. 16,
2013) (settled matter). Another firm, after a change in code and in routing logic,
erroneously allowed millions of orders with a notional value of approximately $116
billion to be sent between 2010 and 2014. Latour Trading LLC, Exchange Act Release

120
other market participants. Several elements of the dealer regulatory regime address these risks,
but some important elements do not currently apply to market participants that are not registered
as dealers, including financial reporting, examinations, and other regulations that facilitate
examinations. Financial statement reporting, transaction reporting (to TRACE244 or CAT245),
and examinations help the Commission detect manipulation or fraud and determine whether
firms are in compliance with applicable regulations. Books and records requirements facilitate
examinations by ensuring that data entries are defined, recorded, and preserved in a consistent
manger across all dealers. PTFs do not submit financial reports to regulators or report their
transactions, are not subject to examinations, and have no regulatory books and records
guidelines. Private funds also do not report transactions to TRACE or directly to CAT, but
registered private fund advisers are subject to regular reporting requirements246 and to books and
records rules. In addition, the Commission has examination authority with respect to registered
private fund advisers.
Private information that market participants who are not registered as dealers do not
report to regulators also creates an impediment to regulators’ ability to study markets in a
structured way, to detect and respond to market events, or to inform investors. For regulators,
the gap between what information registered dealers report and what information other market
 244 Registered dealers report their transactions in fixed-income securities (other than
municipal bonds) to TRACE. Unregistered traders’ fixed-income transactions only
appear in TRACE in two cases: (i) when they trade with a FINRA member, the FINRA
member reports the transaction to TRACE but keeps the counterparty anonymous; or (ii)
when they trade government securities on an ATS that is a FINRA member, the ATS
reports the transaction to TRACE along with the identity of the counterparties.
245 As discussed above, CAT also includes the transactions of firms that are not registered as
dealers, but certain other information is only available for firms that report directly to
CAT.
246 See supra note 233 and accompanying text.
121
participants report varies by type of participant, but may include annual or quarterly reporting,
and transactions reports. For investors, the gap consists of transactions reports for fixed-income
securities other than U.S. Treasury and municipal securities, which reports are made publicly
available. As discussed previously, large private fund advisers file regular reports to the
Commission on Form PF, and the Commission also has authority to examine private fund
advisers. However, private funds do not report their securities transactions to TRACE. Private
funds’ fixed-income transactions may appear in TRACE with the private fund identified, if the
trade occurs on certain ATSs; the transactions may appear in TRACE with the private fund
anonymous, if the trade occurs outside certain ATSs but with another FINRA member firm; or
the transactions may not appear in TRACE at all if the private fund trades with a non-FINRA
member firm. PTFs do submit financial reports to regulators, do not report transactions, and are
not subject to examinations, so regulators have very little insight into their activities. Private
funds also do not report their securities transactions directly to CAT. As discussed previously,
their trades in NMS stocks, OTC equities, and listed options are indirectly reported to CAT by
other counterparties, but CAT does not contain certain other information on firms who do not
report directly.
Information limitations in the market for U.S. Treasury securities became especially
apparent during the instability of March 2020. The IAWG noted in its 2021 IAWG Joint Staff
Report on November 8, 2021, that “In March 2020…there was a [particular] need for timely
information on the positions and transactions of institutions other than dealers.”247 Wider
TRACE reporting would have provided more of such information. Similar information
limitations exist in the markets for other fixed-income securities. Unregistered market
 247 See supra note 5.
122
participants’ transactions in NMS stocks, OTC equities, and listed options are reported to CAT
by other (registered) parties, but their identities in the data remain anonymous and some pretrade data are not reported at all—e.g., time stamps and indications that a large order has been
broken into several smaller orders. Investors who rely on publicly disseminated TRACE also are
impacted by the unreported or the anonymity of important market participants’ trading activities.
4. Competition Among Liquidity Providers
An analysis of the cash U.S. Treasury market for July 2021248 finds that liquidity
provision in the market is reasonably competitive.
249 Table 5 below categorizes firms as
potential liquidity providers in three ways and displays two measures of market concentration.
In column 1, potential liquidity providers include only dealers. In column 2, the list of liquidity
providers also includes PTFs. In column 3, the list of liquidity providers further includes hedge
funds.
250 The first measure of concentration displayed in each column is the volume share of the
5 highest-volume firms. The second concentration measure is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index
(HHI), which is equal to the sum of squared market shares. An index of 1 would indicate a
completely concentrated market with a single liquidity provider. The inverse of the HHI
provides some intuition by giving the number of equally sized competitors that would lead to
such a HHI. For example, a market with 5 equally sized competitors would have a HHI of 1/5 or
0.2. The first column of Table 5 shows that 500 dealers were active in the U.S. Treasury market
in July, 2021, and that the 5 highest-volume of these accounted for 43 percent of the group’s
 248 See supra notes 217, 218, and 219, and accompanying text.
249 A Federal Reserve analysis from 2020 finds that activity on electronic interdealer
platforms is slightly more concentrated, with an HHI of 0.082. See supra note 2.
250 Firms are classified based on an understanding of the individual firms’ businesses. See
supra note 218.
123
total volume. The HHI of liquidity provision in this column is 0.054, or comparable to the
competitive environment that would exist if there were 18 equally sized liquidity providers. If
we also consider PTFs (limited to the PTFs that we can identify in TRACE) to be liquidity
providers (column 2), then 545 liquidity providers were active in July 2021 and the 5 highestvolume firms accounted for 34 percent of the group’s total. The HHI in this case is 0.04, which
is comparable to the competitive environment that would exist among 25 equally sized firms. If
we further consider hedge funds (again, limited to the hedge funds that we can identify in
TRACE) to be liquidity providers (column 3), then 586 liquidity providers were active in the
U.S. Treasury market in July, 2021, and the 5 highest-volume firms accounted for one-third of
the group’s total volume. In this third column, the HHI is 0.039, which is comparable to the
competitive environment that would exist among 26 equally sized firms. The minimal difference
between the numbers in row 2, columns 2–3, does not suggest that hedge funds do not provide
significant liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market. The minimal difference only means that the
hedge funds that we can identify in TRACE do not appear to provide significant liquidity in the
U.S. Treasury market.

The Commission also understands that a large number of firms provide liquidity
provision in the markets for corporate bonds and for equities (not necessarily the same firms),
and that intermediation activity is reasonably competitive in both markets. Research has
documented that, as of the first quarter of 2020, about 600 dealers intermediated in the market
for corporate bonds, but that the top 10 dealers controlled approximately 70 percent of the
volume.251 Another analysis by the Commission252 found that of the 3,972 broker-dealers that
filed Form X-17a-5 (FOCUS report) in 2016, 430 of them were also members of U.S. equities
exchanges, and that the largest 20 broker-dealers controlled approximately 75 percent of the total
assets of all broker-dealers.
The current competitive landscape among liquidity providers is also shaped by the
difference in regulatory treatment between registered dealers and unregistered market
participants that the Commission believes perform dealer-like roles in the markets. The
additional requirements to which registered dealers are subject may result in higher compliance
for registered dealers, which could incentivize less-regulated firms such as PTFs to gain market
share, or to continue to gain market share, from more-regulated dealers. These dynamics may
especially apply to the electronic interdealer segment of the Treasury market, where PTFs now
account for a majority of trading activity (as of 2019).253

125
As described above in Section II, the Commission believes that the Proposed Rules
would support the stability and transparency of U.S. Treasury and other securities markets by
closing the regulatory gap that currently exists and ensuring consistent regulatory oversight of
persons engaging in the type of activities described in the Proposed Rules. As described in
Section II, the Commission believes that the Proposed Rules would support the stability and
transparency of U.S. Treasury and other securities markets by closing the regulatory gap that
currently exists and ensuring consistent regulatory oversight of persons engaging in the type of
activities described in the Proposed Rules. Specifically, the rules would result in increasing the
share of liquidity provision undertaken by persons who are subject to dealer rules related to
financial risk-taking, reporting, deceptive practices, and examinations. As discussed above, these
benefits would all be associated with PTFs registering as dealers, but private funds’ potential
dealer registration would also bring benefits related to net capital requirements and transaction
reporting. If registered private fund advisers were to register as dealers, the benefits of
transaction reporting would apply, but the marginal benefits of other reporting requirements, net
capital requirements, books and records rules, and examinations might be very small, since the
regulatory regime that applies to registered private fund advisers already contains similar
provisions to the rules that apply to dealers.
Costs of the Proposed Rules include registration and membership fees, costs of recordkeeping and reporting, and costs associated with net capital requirements. Additionally, the
Proposed Rules may influence patterns of market participation, which may in turn affect
competition among liquidity providers, market efficiency, and capital formation.
1. Benefits
126
The Proposed Rules seek to mitigate the externalities, discussed in the baseline, that may
arise when market participants who effectively provide liquidity experience financial stress,
engage in manipulative or fraudulent behavior, or whose operations are not subject to regulatory
oversight. To the extent that unregistered market participants engage in activities that satisfy the
qualitative or quantitative standards of the Proposed Rules, requiring them to register as dealers
would promote stability in U.S. securities markets and would help protect investors.
Specifically, the Proposed Rules would bring liquidity providers that are not registered as dealers
into compliance with dealer regulations related to financial risk-taking, reporting, and
examinations. As previously discussed, we believe that PTFs would be the most affected parties,
though potentially some private funds may be affected. Registered private fund advisers may
also be affected under limited circumstances.
Regulations on Financial Risk-Taking: Registered dealers are subject to net capital
requirements (Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1) and to various risk management rules that promote
operational integrity.254 Unregistered PTFs and private funds do not have net capital
requirements, and they may not have the same risk-management requirements. The Net Capital
Rule requires dealers to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet all liabilities at all times,255
thus limiting their probability of financial failure by constraining leverage and creating
incentives against excessive risk-taking,256 and also helping protect creditors. These provisions
help reduce the externalities related to defaults and disorderly trading, which may arise due to
 254 See supra notes 205 and 206 and accompanying text.
255 See supra note 76.
256 See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap
Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital and Segregation
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 86175 (June 21, 2019), 84
FR 43872 (Aug. 22, 2019).
127
firms’ financial stress. As discussed in Section III, the Proposed Rules would require registration
of persons whose trading activity contributes significantly to market liquidity or to price
discovery. Such persons have the ability to significantly impact the markets, so placing these
regulatory safeguards around their risk-taking would benefit investors and support capital
formation by promoting stable markets. These benefits would be largest for PTFs and private
funds, who are currently under no regulations related to risk-taking, but they could also apply to
registered private fund advisers.257
Regulations on Reporting: Registered dealers must file annual reports with the
Commission that include audited financial statements.258 They also report their transactions of
NMS stocks, OTC equities, and listed options directly to CAT,259 and registered dealers who
have selected FINRA as their SRO report their transactions in fixed-income securities (other than
municipal securities) to TRACE.260 Unregistered PTFs do not report any of this information to
regulators. Private fund advisers report certain information on the private funds they manage to
the Commission annually (and, for certain large advisers of certain large hedge funds, each
quarter), but they do not report transactions.
 257 Registered private fund advisers are currently regulated in their capacity as advisers, and
the current adviser regulation contains provisions related to financial risk-taking.
However, the Proposed Rules could also apply to advisers that trade with their own
proprietary capital. The adviser’s proprietary trading is not currently regulated, so the
benefits of registering such an adviser would be comparable to the full benefit of
registering a PTF.
258 See supra note 77.
259 Unregistered market participants’ transactions in NMS stocks, OTC equities, and listed
options are reported to CAT by other (registered) parties, but, as described above, certain
information is only available for entities that report directly to CAT.
260 Unregistered market participants’ transactions in U.S. Treasury securities may appear in
TRACE under certain conditions, but they usually appear with the unregistered
counterparty’s identity kept anonymous. See supra note 217.
128
Reporting requirements, particularly requirements to report transactions directly, enable
regulators to conduct market research that informs their efforts to detect or respond to market
events, to inform investors, to ensure that dealers’ activities are in compliance with regulation,
and research has also shown that transaction reporting can improve market efficiency and
liquidity.261 Transaction reporting in general enhances the ability of the Commission and SROs
to more efficiently and in a more timely manner monitor trading, which should further enhance
the ability of the Commission and SRO staff to effectively enforce SRO rules and the Federal
securities laws, rules, and regulations.262 This enhanced ability of the Commission and SROs
staff to enforce the Federal securities laws, rules, and regulations should help ensure the
efficiency and stability of the markets, and promote investor confidence in the fairness of the
securities markets, which may in turn promote capital formation.263 TRACE for fixed-income
securities other than municipal securities and U.S. Treasury securities are made publicly
available to investors, so this transaction reporting to non-regulatory TRACE particularly
informs investors. The absence of reporting requirements for consequential market participants
thus creates negative externalities for investors. The Proposed Rules are designed to target
persons whose activities can significantly impact markets or who otherwise trade large volumes
of U.S. Treasuries Securities; requiring such persons to further inform regulators of their

129
activities further promotes market stability, investor protection, and capital formation. To the
extent that registered dealers were to select an SRO other than FINRA, the benefits related to
fixed-income transaction reporting would not appear.264
Regulations on Deceptive Practices: Registered dealers are subject to the antimanipulation and antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act, but they
are also subject to the specific anti-manipulative and other anti-fraud rules promulgated under
Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act.265 Neither unregistered PTFs nor private funds are subject to
Section 15(c)(1) and related rules, but registered private fund advisers are subject to antifraud
provisions under Section 206 of the Advisers Act. The persons whom the Proposed Rules would
require to register would be those with the ability to significantly impact markets, including by
manipulation or fraud. Therefore, subjecting them (particularly the PTFs) to the anti-fraud rules
that apply to registered dealers, would contribute to fair and orderly markets and to investor
protection.
Regulations related to Examinations: Registered dealers are subject to examinations by
the Commission and by the relevant SRO, and they are also required to comply with certain
books and records requirements.266 PTFs that are not registered as dealers are not subject to
examinations or to books and records rules, but the Commission has examination authority with
respect to private fund advisers, and registered private fund advisers are subject to recordkeeping
requirements. Examinations help regulators detect manipulative or fraudulent activities, as well
as verify more generally that persons are in compliance with all relevant regulations. Books and
 264 See supra note 77.
265 See supra note 80.
266 See supra note 79.
130
records requirements facilitate examinations by ensuring that data entries are defined, recorded,
and preserved in a consistent manner across all dealers. The Proposed Rules would allow
regulators to examine firms that currently are not registered, including PTFs, who are not
currently subject to examinations, but whose activity contributes significantly to market liquidity
or to price discovery. Therefore, since examinations help ensure compliance with other rules,
this benefit of the Proposed Rules supports all the other benefits discussed above.
Some entities who would satisfy the Proposed Rules’ qualitative or quantitative standards
might nevertheless avoid the registration requirement by exiting a liquidity-providing strategy.
If unregistered entities were to exit and bid-ask spreads were to meaningfully widen, other
(registered) dealers might step in to replace the lost activity. This scenario would result in an
effective transfer of dealer activity from unregistered market participants to registered dealers,
and so would preserve the benefits (and costs) of the Proposed Rules.
2. Costs Associated with Becoming a Registered Dealer
The Proposed Rules would impose costs on certain market participants, including costs of
registering with the Commission and with an SRO, recordkeeping and reporting costs, direct
costs that may stem from meeting net capital requirements (i.e., continuously monitoring
capitalization), and self-evaluation as to whether one is a dealer or not.
267
The initial registration costs would include the costs associated with filing Form BD and
Form ID, SRO membership application fees, and any related legal or consulting costs that may
be needed to (e.g., ensure compliance with rules), including drafting policies and procedures as
may be required. The ongoing costs would include the costs associated with amending Form
 267 Registered dealers would be subject to requirements, such as Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1
and 17 CFR 240.17a-1, 240.17a-3, 240.17a-4, and 240.17-a5 (Exchange Act Rules 17a-1,
17a-3, 17a-4, and 17-a5).
131
BD, ongoing fees associated with SRO membership, and any legal work relating to SRO
membership.
The Commission estimates compliance costs of approximately $600,000 initially and
$265,000 annually thereafter to register as a broker-dealer with the Commission, become a
member of an SRO, and comply with the associated dealer regulations.
268 The costs include
personnel hours, outside legal services, building and maintaining books and records systems,
obtaining or maintaining employee licensure, and direct costs associated with calculating net
capital to comply with the Net Capital Rule. The compliance costs associated with net capital,
reporting, and recordkeeping requirements would depend on the business structure of a
registered dealer (i.e., the capital structure of a dealer and the scope of a dealer’s activities).269
For example, these costs may be lower for private funds, since their advisers are already subject
to requirements concerning books and records, examinations, and internal control systems. In
general, the costs would also vary significantly depending on the types of securities a brokerdealer holds, the level of net capital a broker-dealer maintains, and whether a broker-dealer
 268 Exchange Act Release No. 76324 (Oct. 30, 2015), 80 FR 71388, 71509 (Nov. 16, 2015)
(“Regulation Crowdfunding Adopting Release”) estimates the costs of registering as a
dealer, becoming a member of a national securities association, and complying with the
associated regulation would be approximately $520,000 initially and $230,000 annually
thereafter. Most of these costs involve personnel hours and legal services (currently, the
direct costs of FINRA registration range between $7,500 and $60,000). Since the cost of
legal services and nominal wages paid to administrative and financial operations
employees have approximately risen with the consumer price index since 2015, we adjust
these estimates for inflation of 15.33 percent between October 2015 and September 2021,
based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as recorded by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. See Consumer Price Index, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
available at https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm. We therefore estimate the costs to be
approximately $600,000 initially and $265,000 annually thereafter. We recognize that
these costs may vary significantly across registrants, depending on facts and
circumstances.

carries customer accounts, carries for other broker-dealers, is a registered investment adviser, is
affiliated with an investment adviser, or transacts in a principal capacity.270
For dealers that select an SRO other than FINRA (i.e., an exchange), we believe that the
initial and ongoing costs would be less than $600,000 initially and less than $265,000 annually
thereafter. Dealers that select FINRA as their SRO would incur the costs of reporting their
fixed-income transactions (other than municipal securities) to TRACE.271 Dealers that trade
NMS stocks, OTC equities, or listed options would incur the costs of reporting their transactions
in these securities to CAT.272 As discussed in the CAT Notice and in the CAT Approval Order,
the costs of CAT reporting may vary significantly across broker-dealer firms depending on the
size and scope of their activities (e.g., the number of CAT-reportable order events that the firm
has and whether the firm needs to report customer information).273 In these releases, the
Commission estimated that the one-time implementation costs related to CAT reporting could
range from $849,000 for small firms that did not previously report to the Order Audit Trail
 270 Id.
271 TRACE fees include system fees of between $20 and $260 per month plus transaction
reporting fees, which are one of: (i) $0.475 per trade for trades with par value up to
$200,000, (ii) $2.375 per million dollars par value for trades with par value more than
$200,000 but less than $1 million, or (iii) $2.375 per trade for trades with par value of at
least $1 million or $1.50 per trade for agency pass-through MBS that are traded TBA or
SBA-backed ABS that are traded TBA. See FINRA Rule 7730 (Trade Reporting and
Compliance Engine), available at https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finrarules/7730.

System (OATS) to $7,231,000 for many large firms.274 The Commission also estimated that the
ongoing annual costs of CAT reporting could range from $443,000 for small firms to $4,756,000
for many large firms.275 We adopt these estimates and adjust them for inflation between
November 2016 and September 2021.276 This adjustment yields a per-firm cost estimate of
approximately $965,000 to $8,218,000 for one-time implementation plus ongoing costs of
approximately $503,000 to $5,405,000 annually.
The wide range of these estimates indicates significant uncertainty about the costs related
to CAT reporting that individual firms that trade equities or options may have to incur if they are
required to register as dealers as a result of the Proposed Rules. We make two related
observations. First, firms that would start reporting to CAT as a result of the Proposed Rules are
likely to have a relatively large number of CAT-reportable order events, since the Proposed
Rules are targeting significant liquidity-providers. Therefore, for these firms, the costs of CAT
reporting are likely to be higher than the lower bounds of $965,000 for implementation costs and
$503,000 for ongoing annual costs.277 Second, firms that would be required to report to CAT as
 274 See CAT Notice, 81 FR 30725-30726 and CAT Approval Order, 81 FR 84861-84862.
The Commission also estimated that small firms that previously reported to OATS would
incur lower one-time implementation costs related to CAT reporting – $424,000.
However, we believe that this lower estimate for related implementation costs is not
applicable to firms that would be covered by the Proposed Rules, because firms that
would be required to register as dealers and start reporting to CAT as a result of the
Proposed Rules are unlikely to have prior experience of reporting to OATS.
275 See id.
276 The estimates are adjusted for an inflation rate of 13.66 percent based on the Bureau of
Labor Statistics data on CPI-U between November 2016 and September 2021. See supra
note 268.
277 It is also possible that a firm would satisfy the quantitative or the qualitative standards of
the Proposed Rules by transacting in asset other than those that are reported to CAT.
Such a firm would still be required to register as a dealer and report any transactions it
may have in NMS stocks, OTC equities, and listed options. However, such a firm could
134
a result of the Proposed Rules do not carry customer accounts and would therefore not need to
report any customer information to CAT. Thus, for these firms, the costs of CAT reporting are
likely to be lower than the upper bounds of $8,218,000 for implementation costs and $5,405,000
for ongoing annual costs.278
The Commission recognizes that the costs associated with obtaining and maintaining
SRO membership and reporting transactions may vary significantly depending on entity
characteristics, activity characteristics, and the degree of the firm’s reliance on outside legal or
consulting advice. For example, the costs of FINRA membership279 depend on, among other
things, the number of associated persons being registered, the scope of brokerage activities,
revenue,280 the number of registered persons, the number of branch offices, and trading volume.

have a relatively low number of CAT-reportable order events and hence relatively low
costs of CAT reporting.
278 In the CAT Approval Order, the Commission discussed its belief that the requirement of
the CAT NMS Plan to report customer information represents a significant source of
CAT reporting costs. See CAT Approval Order, 81 FR 84868-84869. Furthermore, in
the CAT Notice, the Commission estimated CAT reporting costs for 14 electronic
liquidity providers (“ELPs”), which are large registered broker-dealers that do not carry
customer accounts and are not FINRA members. See CAT Notice, 81 FR 30724-30726.
The Commission estimated that for these ELPs the one-time implementation costs related
to CAT reporting would be $3,876,000 and the annual ongoing costs of CAT reporting
would be $3,226,000. When adjusted to inflation between November 2016 and
September 2021 (see supra note 265), these estimates become approximately $4,405,000
for the one-time implementation costs and approximately $3,667,000 for the annual
ongoing costs of CAT reporting. Because the ELPs do not carry customer accounts and
operate as liquidity providers in the markets for equities and options, their estimated costs
of CAT reporting may be applicable to some of the larger firms that would be required to
report to CAT as a result of the Proposed Rules.
279 See Schedule of Registration and Exam Fees, FINRA, available at
https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/classic-crd/fee-schedule#examfees, for the
schedule of FINRA registration fees.
280 FINRA imposes a Gross Income Assessment as follows: (1) $1,200 on a Member Firm’s
annual gross revenue up to $1 million; (2) a charge of 0.1215 percent on a Member
Firm’s annual gross revenue between $1 million and $25 million; (3) a charge of 0.2599
135
TRACE and CAT reporting costs also vary depending on security type, order size, and trading
venue, among other factors. Entities with a smaller number of registered persons, fewer
brokerage activities, smaller trading volume, and smaller revenue would face lower direct costs.
In addition to the monitoring costs incurred to comply with the Net Capital Rule,
described above, newly registered dealers who previously held less capital than what is required
would have to increase their capitalization either by raising equity or by scaling back trading
activities. However, since higher levels of net capital reduce a firm’s probability of default,
these direct costs of net capital requirements may be partially offset by reductions in the firm’s
cost of capital.
Market participants may also incur costs related to self-evaluation regarding whether the
qualitative standards describe their activities. Since the quantitative standard is based on
monthly Treasury-trading volume, which is easy to define and measure, we do not believe any
market participants would incur additional costs to assess whether this standard would require
them to register.
Some currently unregistered market participants may be affiliated with other firms that
are currently registered dealers, and in such cases, the unregistered firm may seek to avoid the
direct costs described above by shifting trading volume to its affiliated dealer. Other entities that

are captured by the Proposed Rules may restructure their legal organization to isolate the activity
that triggered the rules into a separate entity. Such activity shifting and legal reorganizations
may incur costs, such as the costs of changing computer systems or paying attorney fees. To the
extent that the securities-dealing activity ends up being conducted by an entity that registers with
the Commission, all the benefits of Proposed Rules still apply.
In response to a related initiative in 2010,281 at least one PTF expressed its opinion to the
Commission that the costs of PTF registration are not justified because equity markets worked
well during the autumn of 2008 (then the most-recent financial crisis) and because the PTF
believed that PTFs in general help market integrity by providing liquidity during difficult
situations.282 However, the 2021 IAWG Joint Staff Report showed that, during the U.S.
Treasury market volatility of March 2021, PTFs’ share of market intermediation fell
considerably more than did dealers’ share.283 These results suggest that PTFs may not, or may
no longer, promote market stability in all securities markets in ways that registered dealers do
not. Accordingly, we believe that the benefits of registering PTFs who are also significant
market participants justify the costs.
PTFs, since they do not have clients or customers, would bear the costs of registration
themselves. Private funds, however, may either bear the costs themselves or the costs may be
borne by their investment adviser. If the funds bear the costs, these costs would be passed on to
the funds’ investors.

3. Other Effects, Including Impact on Efficiency, Competition, and
Capital Formation
The Proposed Rules may produce several indirect benefits or costs, based on the extent to
which they encourage or discourage participation in securities markets. The Proposed Rules
could either increase or decrease market participation due to three possible effects. First, fairer
and more stable markets could encourage greater market participation. Second, registration and
compliance costs could lead some currently unregistered liquidity providers to decrease their
activity or even exit the market. If they do so, other firms may or may not increase their own
activity to compensate. Third, large-volume and small-volume market participants may choose to
differentially increase or decrease their market participation, so that the Proposed Rules may
affect market concentration. Changes in patterns of market participation could affect market
efficiency, market competition, and capital formation.
a. Effects on Efficiency
The Proposed Rules could affect market efficiency—i.e., price discovery, or the speed
with which new information or developments impact the market price of a security—depending
on whether the net effect on market participation is positive or negative. Other things equal,
markets with greater participation are more liquid. The net effect on market efficiency is
uncertain. On the one hand, improved investor confidence might lead to greater market
participation that improves market efficiency for two reasons. First, new market participants
may have additional information, in which case the orders they submit based on this information
would aid price discovery. Second, higher trading volumes would mean that prices would react
faster to changes in securities’ fundamental values.
138
On the other hand, if important and informed market participants, such as PTFs or hedge
funds, permanently reduce their market activity or their pursuit of certain investment strategies,
market efficiency may decline in the markets for some securities.
b. Effects on Competition
The net effect that the Proposed Rules may have on competition is uncertain. On the one
hand, the Proposed Rules would promote competition by standardizing the regulatory treatment
of—i.e., leveling the playing field for—all firms engaged in the activities that meet the proposed
standards described above.284 For instance, the Proposed Rules would require all firms that
conduct these activities to incur the costs of complying with the same rules regarding
registration, net capital requirements, books and records, and other requirements; whereas
currently, only those who are registered bear these costs.
On the other hand, other effects on competition among liquidity providers285 depend on
the extent to which the rules encourage or discourage market participation by affected parties.
The indirect benefits to all market participants—particularly the additional risk-mitigating
provisions and the Commission’s increased ability to detect manipulation or fraud—may
encourage some market participants to increase their liquidity-providing activities. However, the
direct costs that the Proposed Rules would impose on currently unregistered firms who currently
engage in covered activities may cause them to scale back these activities.286 For example, if a
 284 Although the analysis discussed in the baseline showed that registered dealers have much
greater market share in the U.S. Treasury market (see supra Table 1 and note 217), PTFs
are the largest participants in the automated interdealer Treasury market (see supra note
2).
285 As previously described, the qualitative standards of the Proposed Rules apply to persons
whose activities have “the effect of providing liquidity.” See Section III.B.
286 See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap
Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for
139
hedge fund strategy were to fall under the Proposed Rules, the fund engaged in that activity
might exit the strategy altogether in order to avoid registration. Some research on high-frequency
trading has shown that firms engaged in this activity improve competition across trading venues,
by arbitraging cross-venue differences in security prices,
287 which suggests that their withdrawal
may have a negative impact on competition. Furthermore, in response to a similar initiative in
2010, commenters stated that registering PTFs as dealers would negatively impact competition
among liquidity providers by creating barriers to entry.
288
Any net effect on competition would likely be small because, as discussed in the baseline
for competition above (including Table 5 for the U.S. Treasury market), we understand that
liquidity provision in securities markets is reasonably competitive even among currently
registered dealers. The precise magnitude of the effect in competition is also uncertain, and
would depend on whether the benefits would accrue more to currently registered dealers with
large or with small volumes and on whether the costs are more burdensome to currently
unregistered firms with large or with small volumes. We believe the benefits would apply to all
market participants alike. The quantitative factor in proposed Rule 3a44-2 would apply only to
firms with Treasury-trading volume above the threshold. However, the qualitative factors may
also apply to small-volume firms, and some costs may be greater for these firms on two points.
First, FINRA’s Gross Income Assessment289 generally declines as a percentage of revenue for

LLC, and Quantlab Financial, LLC (Apr. 23, 2010).
289 See supra note 280.
140
larger firms. Second, fees associated with reporting to TRACE290 are smaller per dollar par
value for larger trades.
c. Effects on Capital Formation
The Proposed Rules’ effect on capital formation may depend on any net change in market
participation (aggregate trading volume) that results from the rules, and on any decrease or
increase in competition among liquidity providers. Other things equal, higher volumes and more
competition improve liquidity. In turn, greater liquidity increases asset prices, reduces
borrowing costs, and promotes capital formation.
The likely effect on aggregate market participation is uncertain. On the one hand, we
believe the increased regulatory burdens would fall on relatively few firms while the benefits of
fairer and more stable markets would extend broadly to all market participants—since the
baseline risk of an institution’s failure would also propagate broadly by reducing market
liquidity, increasing price volatility, or imposing losses on creditors. In the U.S. Treasury
market, for example, we estimate that no more than 46 firms have dollar trading volumes that
surpass the $25 billion threshold in the quantitative standard of proposed Rule 3a44-2, as
discussed in the baseline. The actual number of affected firms may be lower, since some of
these 46 may be exempt financial institutions,
291 and still others may be affiliated with other
firms that are dealers, in which case the corporate parent could potentially avoid the costs of the
rule by shifting certain activities to the registered dealer affiliate.
On the other hand, the Proposed Rules may cause some market participants to scale back
or exit certain liquidity-providing strategies in order to avoid registration; or, even if they do not,
 290 See supra note 271.
291 See supra notes 9 and 29.
141
compliance costs including net capital requirements might lead them to scale back some
activities. If such reductions in liquidity provision occur, we cannot be certain that other market
participants would arise to replace the lost liquidity. Even if other participants do eventually
arise, lost liquidity can lead to mispricing in the short run.
Changes in aggregate trading volume may also affect market liquidity in other ways. If
the Proposed Rules increase investors’ confidence in the stability and fairness of markets, they
may increase their participation. Increased trading volume theoretically enhances market
liquidity because of the following two ways in which high volume benefits dealers.292 First,
dealers who trade a lot can spread their fixed costs over more trades. Second, dealers’ risk is
smaller when high volume makes it easier to adjust or lay off net positions. These benefits make
liquidity provision more profitable, which results in narrower bid-ask spreads if dealers compete
with one another for orders.
Effects on market competition can also influence market liquidity. If the Proposed Rules
enhance competition, bid-ask spreads may decrease; if the Proposed Rules weaken competition,
bid-ask spreads may increase. As discussed above, the net effect that the Proposed Rules would
have on competition is uncertain.
D. Reasonable Alternatives
The Commission considered several alternatives to the Proposed Rules: (1) raise or lower
the quantitative factor; (2) replace qualitative standards with quantitative standards; (3) remove
the exclusion for registered investment companies; (4) Remove the exclusion from aggregation
for registered investment adviser client accounts where the advisers only have investment
 292 See Larry Harris, “Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners,”
Oxford University Press, 2003.
142
discretion; (5) exclude registered investment advisers; (6) exclude private funds; and (7) require
private funds and private fund advisers to report transactions.
1. Alternative Thresholds for the Quantitative Factor
The quantitative factor would require registration of all entities with monthly trading
volume above $25 billion during four out of the past six calendar months. A threshold lower
than $25 billion would increase the costs of the Proposed Rules (by requiring many more entities
to register as dealers), but would only somewhat increase the benefits (since additional
registrants would not represent very much aggregate trading volume). A threshold higher than
$25 billion would decrease both the benefits and the costs of the Proposed Rules (by requiring
registration of fewer firms but failing to capture a significant portion of aggregate trading
volume).
Figure 2 shows the wide range of alternative thresholds that the Commission considered
in an analysis293 of U.S. Treasury-market transactions reported to TRACE during July 2021.294
As described in the baseline, since the subset of TRACE data where we can verify the identity of
the traders (“identified TRACE”) is approximately 42 percent of all non-FINRA members’
transactions in TRACE (many non-FINRA members only appear anonymously, also as described
above), we believe that the thresholds in Figure 2 (based on identified TRACE) are
approximately 42 percent of the equivalent threshold in the overall U.S. Treasury market.
Therefore, the threshold of $10 billion in Figure 2 corresponds with the Proposed Rules’
quantitative threshold of $25 billion.295 Within identified TRACE, this figure shows the
 293 See supra note 217 and accompanying text.
294 The analysis also back-tested the thresholds to July 2019 and found that the results based
on July 2021 data are qualitatively representative.
295 We assume that all entities in identified TRACE are proportionally represented in the
143
percentage of firms (dashed line) and the percentage of volume that would be captured by
various quantitative thresholds. A threshold of $10 billion would capture 26 percent of the firms
and 96 percent of the volume in the identified TRACE data. Larger thresholds include many
fewer firms but also considerably less trading volume—e.g., moving from a threshold of $10
billion to $50 billion would capture 32 fewer firms (18 percent of the 174 firms in the analysis)
but also 15 percent less of the aggregate non-FINRA member trading volume in TRACE.
Smaller thresholds include more firms but not very much additional volume—moving from a
threshold of $10 billion to $5 billion would capture 8 more firms (5 percent of the 174 firms in
the analysis) but only 1 percent more of the aggregate non-FINRA member trading volume in
TRACE. The threshold that maximizes the Proposed Rule’s benefits (by including firms
responsible for a large percentage of trading volume) while minimizing costs (by limiting the
number of firms that will be required to register) appears to be somewhere around $10 billion.

anonymous TRACE data. If firms engaging in dealer activities are overrepresented in
identified TRACE, then the Proposed Rules’ quantitative threshold of $25 billion would
correspond to a threshold in Figure 2 of higher than $10 billion.
144
Figure 2. Percent of Non-FINRA Member Volume and Non-FINRA Member Firms
Captured by Various Volume Thresholds, July 2021
For several potential monthly volume thresholds, this figure shows what percentage of
identified non-FINRA member TRACE volume and what percentage of identified non-FINRA
member firms would have crossed the threshold and so would have been required to register as
dealers. “Identified” refers to the subset of TRACE data where regulators can observe the
identities of non-FINRA member counterparties. This figure excludes all trading volumes and
any firms that only appear in TRACE anonymously.
2. Provide Only Quantitative Factors
The Proposed Rules list several factors that will guide the Commission in determining
whether securities market participants are dealers. With the exception of paragraph (a)(4) in
proposed Rule 3a44-2—dollar volume of cash Treasury trading—all factors are qualitative.
Alternatively, the Commission could replace the qualitative factors with quantitative “brightline” thresholds, above or below which firms would be required to register as dealers.
Particularly, the first qualitative factor (“routinely mak[es] roughly comparable purchases and
sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day”) could express a range of buy-sell
balance, and firms could be required to register if their securities-trading activity features a buysell balance within that range.
145
The alternative rule could define buy-sell balance as the absolute value of (buy – sell) /
(buy + sell), so that the measure would always fall between 0 (as when buy = sell) and 1 (as
when a firm only buys or only sells). The buy-sell balance could then be calculated each day for
each individual security (CUSIP), for each market participant. Any market participant with a
buy-sell balance for a security that is below a quantitative threshold for a certain number of days
per month could be required to register as a government securities dealer or as a dealer. For
example, a firm whose buy-sell balance for CUSIP 78462F103 (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) that is
below 0.2 for 13 days in a month could be required to register as a dealer, regardless of its buysell balance in other securities. The Proposed Rules could also have a de minimis cutoff, so that
no market participant that trades less than, say, $1 million per month could be required to
register. The de minimis could help ensure that small, individual investors would not be required
to register.
Table 6 below shows the number of market participants who would be required to
register under a few iterations of this alternative rule, based on the buy-sell balance of the
highest-volume securities in the U.S. Treasury market (10-yr on-the-run note) and the equity
market (SPDR S&P 00 ETF). The first row of data show that, if the rule were based on having a
buy-sell balance of less than 0.2 (a 60-40 split or more even) for at least 14 days in a month, with
a daily de minimis threshold of $10,000, then the firms behind 61 CAT FDID institutional
customer accounts would have to register as dealers based on their trading of SPY, and 20 firms
(not necessarily the same ones) would have to register as government securities dealers based on
their trading of the 10-yr on-the-run Treasury note. It is possible that additional firms would
meet the proposed dealer definition based on their trading of other securities, but the securities in
Table 6 are by far the largest in their respective classes (equities and Treasuries).
146
Table 6. Number of Market Participants Satisfying Quantitative Buy-Sell Balance
This table shows the number of firms that would be required to register based on the buy-sell
balance of their trades of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the highest-volume equity security) or
the 10-yr on-the-run Treasury note (the highest-volume Treasury security). Specifically, the
rule would require registration of firms with a buy-sell balance below a certain threshold for
either of these securities, for 14 days in a month. The firms that satisfy the buy-sell balance
factor based on SPY (column 1) are not necessarily the same as those that satisfy the factor
based on the 10-yr note (column 2). Equity data is for October 2021, and market participants
are identified by CAT FDID institutional customer accounts. CAT FDID institutional
customer account is not synonymous with firm; a firm may have multiple CAT FDIDs, and
multiple firms may also share a single CAT FDID. Furthermore, some of the CAT FDID
customer accounts may represent investment companies registered under the Investment
Company Act, which are not covered by the Proposed Rules. Treasury data is for July 2021.
SPY 10-yr note
(on-the-run)
de minimis volume (applied daily) (buy–sell) / (buy + sell)
$10,000 < 0.2 61 20
< 0.1 44 15
$100,000 < 0.2 57 20
< 0.1 41 15
We considered including “similar securities” in rule text and interpreting “similar
securities” as including different CUSIPs that share similar characteristics—e.g., same issuer or
same maturity. However, such an approach may be too broad, and may include a wide variety of
arbitrage strategies or relative value strategies. For example, firms may trade securities with the
same issuer and similar maturity when they arbitrage between on-the-run Treasuries against offthe-run Treasuries, or they may trade securities of similar issuers and similar characteristics
when they take a long position in one company’s equity offset by a short position in a close
competitor. Since we do not view such strategies as descriptive of being a dealer, this alternative
to the Proposed Rules defines the buy-sell balance within CUSIP only.
Using quantitative factors instead of qualitative factors could provide firms with
additional certainty as to whether they should register as dealers. However, we believe that a
rule that relies solely on quantitative factors would be less capable of distinguishing firms that
147
are liquidity providers from those that are not because at present we do not have a reliable
quantitative framework for defining liquidity provision. Therefore, this alternative would likely
require registration of some firms that are not liquidity providers or market-makers, thus
burdening these firms with all of the registration costs described above without doing much to
enhance market stability or improve regulators’ insight into market activity (since such firms do
not play central market roles); and the alternative may also miss some firms that do provide
liquidity, thus allowing them to continue operating without registering, as in the baseline.
3. Remove Exclusion for Registered Investment Companies
The Proposed Rules explicitly exclude registered investment companies. An alternative
would be to remove this exclusion, as it is possible that these entities might satisfy the criteria
and, collectively or individually, might be important liquidity providers in securities markets.
Requiring them to register as dealers might further standardize the books and records practices of
market liquidity providers and, to the extent that registered investment companies were to choose
FINRA as their SRO, their registration might contribute toward the completeness of fixedincome transaction reporting in TRACE. For non-municipal securities, additional TRACE
reporting would enhance market stability by supporting regulators’ ability to research,
understand, and respond to market events; for non-government and non-municipal securities,
additional TRACE reporting would also better inform investors. If, instead of registering as
dealer, registered investment companies were to cease the activities that satisfy the Proposed
Rules’ standards, these benefits would not materialize.
This alternative would also lead to significant costs and uncertainty. Registered
investment companies have different business models and serve different market purposes than
PTFs or hedge funds, and the regulatory regime that has evolved around liquidity providers
148
might be inadequate or inappropriate for registered investment companies. As one example, it is
unclear how registered investment companies would comply with net capital requirements, or
how they would define net capital. Moreover, the benefits of the proposals as applied to
registered investment companies would be significantly lower than for PTFs because registered
investment companies are subject to an extensive regulatory framework based on the Investment
Company Act and associated rules.296
We believe that affected parties will not have sufficient incentives to evade the proposal
by registering as a registered investment company, because the requirements to be a registered
investment company are sufficiently similar to the proposal. For example, registered investment
companies must be securities issuers, they are significantly constrained in their ability to borrow,
and they are subject to limitations on their derivatives positions. We understand that leverage and
derivatives are integral parts of the types of trading strategies that would satisfy the Proposed
Rules’ standards. Moreover, registered investment companies are required to disclose details
regarding their portfolio holdings. We acknowledge that the costs and benefits of applying the
Proposed Rules to registered investment companies may differ from applying them to other
market participants, and we request comment on the costs and benefits of excluding registered
investment companies.
4. Remove the Exclusion from Aggregation for Registered Investment
Adviser Client Accounts where the Advisers Only Have Investment
Discretion
A registered investment adviser may have client accounts (including private funds and
separately managed accounts) that are not registered as dealers but whose activity individually or
collectively satisfies the Proposed Rules’ activity standards. The Proposed Rules would not
 296 See supra notes 104–114 and accompanying text.
149
attribute the activities of those accounts to the registered investment adviser if the adviser’s
control over the accounts simply involves investment discretion. The Proposed Rules would
require the registered investment adviser to aggregate client accounts if it exercises certain
control rights over the accounts (voting rights, capital contributions, or rights to amounts upon
dissolution).297 Alternatively, the rule could require registered investment advisers to aggregate
client accounts over which the adviser only has investment discretion, so that all advisers would
need to aggregate all of their (non-dealer) discretionary accounts in order to determine whether
their activities fall under the Proposed Rules.
This alternative would strengthen the benefits described above by applying more broadly
the leverage constraints and transaction reporting requirements of the dealer regulations. If
advisers or their funds were to avoid registration by reducing or ceasing certain trading activities,
the marginal benefits of this alternative could still materialize if registered dealers then increased
their own activities to compensate. This alternative would further promote market stability by
ensuring that liquidity-providing activities are conducted by entities that maintain minimum
levels of net capital. The alternative would result in a greater number of liquidity-providing
transactions being directly reported to TRACE (to the extent that new dealer registrants choose
FINRA as their SRO) or to CAT, which would enhance market stability by supporting
regulators’ ability to research, understand, and respond to market events. For non-government
and non-municipal fixed-income securities, additional TRACE reporting would also better
inform investors since FINRA disseminates those data publicly. The benefits of TRACE
reporting would not appear for new dealer registrants choosing another SRO, such as a stock
exchange.
 297 See text in proposed Rules 3a5-4(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 3a44-2(b)(2)(ii)(B).
150
However, this alternative would also carry disadvantages, including greater regulatory
costs and possible negative effects on market liquidity, efficiency, and competition. Regulatory
costs, including those associated with registration, reporting, and maintaining net capital, would
increase for any new dealer registrants, but self-assessment costs would also increase for advisers
that must continually determine their obligations under the Proposed Rules. If advisers or their
accounts were to avoid registration by reducing or ceasing certain trading activities, and if
registered dealers did not then increase their own activities to compensate, then market efficiency
and liquidity may decline. Also, aggregating all discretionary accounts for the purposes of
determining an adviser’s obligations under the Proposed Rules may reduce efficiency by creating
incentives against economies of scale associated with large advisers. Finally, competition among
liquidity providers may decline, but we believe that liquidity provision in U.S. security markets
would remain reasonably competitive.
Relative to the Proposed Rules, this alternative would primarily apply dealer regulations
to smaller private funds or separately managed accounts (via their advisers), since larger funds
and their advisers are more likely to be covered under the Proposed Rules. These benefits of
new leverage constraints and additional transaction reporting would be small for such funds,
while the funds would still bear all the registration and compliance costs described above.
Therefore, we believe the additional benefits of this alternative would not justify the additional
costs.
5. Exclude Registered Investment Advisers
The Proposed Rules do not aggregate registered investment advisers’ client accounts
(including private funds or separately managed accounts) and attribute their activity to the
adviser, as long as the adviser’s control over the accounts is limited to investment discretion.
151
Accounts over which the adviser’s control rights include voting rights, capital contributions, or
the rights to amounts upon dissolution would be aggregated and attributed to the adviser in
determining whether the Proposed Rules would require the adviser to register as a dealer.
298
Registered investment advisers can also trigger application of the Proposed Rules due to their
own proprietary trading. Alternatively, the Commission could propose an exclusion for all
registered investment advisers.
The additional exclusion would reduce the benefits described above, since it would limit
the Proposed Rules’ ability to raise the share of liquidity provision conducted by firms that are
subject to the dealer rule. The Proposed Rule would do so by: (i) inducing additional liquidity
providers to register as dealers; or (ii) inducing liquidity providers who do not wish to register as
dealers to cease their liquidity-providing strategies. If registered investment advisers
categorically were excluded, it is likely that fewer of them would register and that fewer of them
would register client accounts in order to avoid aggregating those accounts’ activities. Although
registered advisers would still be subject to the existing regulations described above, including
conduct rules, books and records requirements, reporting requirements, and examinations, their
exclusion would undermine the Proposed Rules’ benefits related to net capital requirements and
to transaction reporting.
This alternative would also reduce the costs, since fewer entities would be subject to the
dealer regime and fewer entities would be induced to exit certain trading strategies in order to
avoid the dealer regime. The potential negative effects on market liquidity, efficiency, and
competition would therefore be smaller under this alternative.
 298 See text in proposed Rules 3a5-4(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 3a44-2(b)(2)(ii)(B).
152
However, a blanket exclusion may exclude, now or in the future, a large adviser whose
client accounts, if aggregated, would meet the standards of the Proposed Rules and provide
significant liquidity in the securities markets. Also, we are concerned that this alternative rule
might lead a PTF to seek to register as an investment adviser rather than as a dealer, in order to
escape the requirements to report transactions and maintain net capital. The regulations that
apply to registered investment companies place greater restrictions on leverage and derivatives
positions than do the regulations that apply to registered investment advisers, so it would be
unlikely that PTFs would seek to register as investment companies. Due to the way in which this
alternative compromises the Proposed Rules’ benefits related to net capital requirements and
transaction reporting, and due also to the possibility for regulatory arbitrage, we believe the
benefits of this alternative do not justify the costs.
6. Exclude Private Funds
The Proposed Rules do not exclude private funds, since we believe some private funds—
particularly some hedge funds—engage in activities that have the effect of providing liquidity in
securities market. The Commission could explicitly exclude private funds in order to avoid
deterring certain fund strategies that may not be indicative of securities dealing. This exclusion
would potentially reduce some of the benefits that would accrue if the Proposed Rules were to
capture liquidity-providing activities—either because funds who satisfy the qualitative or
quantitative standards register, or else because funds who satisfy the standards exit certain
strategies to avoid registration and other (registered) dealers then arise to replace the lost activity.
Excluding private funds would also reduce the costs of lost liquidity and reduced market
efficiency that could materialize if affected private funds exit certain strategies without being
replaced.
153
However, the Commission believes that some private funds effectively provide liquidity
in securities markets, and the Proposed Rules’ intent is to apply dealer regulation to these
activities. Excluding these funds would guarantee that the dealer regime would fail to capture
this type of securities dealing activity. Furthermore, a blanket exclusion for hedge funds may
provide an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. For example, PTFs may seek to restructure
themselves as private funds, thus preempting the intended benefits of the Proposed Rules. This
may be particularly true given the similarity in incentive structures mentioned above.
Despite the high degree of uncertainty around private funds and the possible negative
effects of requiring some private funds to register as dealers, the Commission believes that not
excluding them is more likely to meet the Proposed Rules’ objectives than excluding them. We
therefore believe the costs of excluding private funds are justified by the potential benefits.
7. Transaction reporting regime for private funds and private fund
advisers
As described above, private funds and private fund advisers not registered as dealers are
not subject to the requirement to report transactions to TRACE. Alternatively, the Commission
could require private funds or private fund advisers who meet the rule’s activity standards to
report to TRACE, without requiring them to comply with the other aspects of dealer regulations.
However, this alternative would not require private funds or private fund advisers to comply with
net capital requirements, or with the operational risk-management provisions of the dealer
regime. Therefore, this alternative would fail to address all of the potential for negative
externalities that may stem from market participants’ financial stress, as discussed in the
baseline. It would also entail greater complexity in the need to specify how alternative entities
would become subject to TRACE reporting.
154
This alternative would reduce key benefits of the proposal, but it would also reduce some
of the costs related to registration, compliance with requirements other than transaction reporting
to TRACE, and self-evaluation. We do not believe the reduced costs justify the reduced benefits.
E. Requests for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of this initial economic analysis,
including whether the analysis has: (1) identified all benefits and costs, including all effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation; (2) given due consideration to each benefit and
cost, including each effect on efficiency, competition, and capital formation; and (3) identified
and considered reasonable alternatives to the proposed new rules and rule amendments. We
request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding the Proposed Rules,
our analysis of the potential effects of the Proposed Rules and proposed amendments, and other
matters that may have an effect on the Proposed Rules. We request that commenters identify
sources of data and information as well as provide data and information to assist us in analyzing
the economic consequences of the Proposed Rules and proposed amendments. We also are
interested in comments on the qualitative benefits and costs we have identified and any benefits
and costs we may have overlooked. In addition to our general request for comments on the
economic analysis associated with the Proposed Rules and proposed amendments, we request
specific comment on certain aspects of the proposal:
Baseline
57. Are firms that are not registered as dealers or as government securities dealers
important participants in securities market? If so, in which markets and in what
ways? Do commenters agree that such firms have emerged as de facto liquidity
providers?
155
58. The quantitative factor in proposed Rule 3a44-2 would identify as government
securities dealers persons that trade more than $25 billion of Treasury securities
monthly, during four out of the past six calendar months. Do you agree that
approximately 46 firms would be government securities dealers based on this
standard? Responses should provide empirical support, if possible.
59. One of the rules’ qualitative factors would identify as dealers and government
securities dealers persons that “routinely [make] roughly comparable purchases
and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day.” Approximately
how many firms would be dealers or government securities dealers based on this
factor? Responses should provide empirical support, if possible.
60. Do you agree that PTFs have emerged as de facto liquidity providers in the
market for U.S. Treasury securities? To what extent do PTFs also provide
liquidity in other securities markets?
61. Do you agree with the Commission’s description of the potential market
disruptions that may follow the failure of one or more market participants that are
not registered as dealers—i.e., the potential negative effects on creditors,
counterparties, market liquidity, and market volatility? Why or why not?
62. Do you agree with the Commission’s description of the externality that arises due
to the possibility of manipulative or fraudulent behavior? Why or why not?
63. Do you agree with the Commission’s statement that the lack of regulatory insight
into the practices and transactions of unregistered market participants negatively
impacts markets by constraining regulators’ ability to understand and respond to
significant market events? Why or why not?
156
Economic Effects, Including Impact of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
64. Do you agree that the Proposed Rules would promote investor protection and
orderly markets by increasing the financial stability and resiliency of individual
liquidity providers in securities markets, particularly those liquidity providers that
are not registered with the Commission? Why or why not?
65. Do you agree that the Proposed Rules would promote investor protection and
orderly markets by better informing regulators through more comprehensive
transaction reporting, annual filings by newly registered dealers, and
examinations?
66. Do you agree that the Proposed Rules would deter manipulation or fraud
behavior, by improving the Commission’s ability to detect it? Why or why not?
67. Do you agree with the Commission’s description of the direct costs incurred by
new registrants—e.g., costs of registering, costs of SRO membership, costs of
reporting, etc.? Why or why not?
68. Do you agree that the Proposed Rules would have offsetting positive and negative
effects on market participation, market liquidity, price efficiency, competition
among liquidity providers, and capital formation? Are the overall effects on each
of these likely to be positive or negative? Please explain.
69. How will firms that register as dealers in response to the Proposed Rules bring
themselves into compliance with the net capital requirements? Please provide
details regarding how the new dealers will implement and manage their
compliance.
157
70. Do you expect market participants, especially those captured by the Proposed
Rules, to alter their legal structures? What changes are they likely to make and
what effects will those changes have?
71. Do you expect some market participants, whom the Proposed Rules would
otherwise require to register as dealers, to reduce or exit certain activities in order
to avoid the requirement to register? What types of entities would do so, and
which activities would be affected?
Reasonable Alternatives
72. What benefits or costs would result from setting the threshold on the quantitative
factor higher or lower than $25 billion monthly volume during four out of the past
six calendar months?
73. What benefits or costs would result from limiting the quantitative threshold by
incorporating other characteristics of trading activity, such as turnover or balance
of buys and sells? For instance, an alternative quantitative standard could require
firms to register as dealers if they met BOTH a dollar volume threshold and a
turnover threshold; another alternative standard could require firms to register if
they meet BOTH a buy-volume threshold and a sell-volume threshold.
74. What benefits or costs would result from replacing the qualitative factors with
quantitative “bright-line” thresholds?
75. What benefits and costs would result from removing the exclusion for registered
investment companies? How would these benefits and costs differ from the
benefits and costs described above?
158
76. What benefits or costs would result from removing the exclusion for registered
investment advisers that only have investment discretion over client funds?
77. What benefits or costs would result from excluding private funds?
78. Are there other reasonable alternatives to the Proposed Rules that the Commission
has not addressed? Commenters should describe any additional alternatives,
along with the benefits and costs relative to the Proposed Rules.
VI. Paperwork Reduction Act
The Proposed Rules would define terms and do not in and of themselves contain
“collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1995 (“PRA”).299 However, the new definitions may affect the number of respondents that meet
the “collection of information” requirements in other Commission rules. The Commission
believes the Proposed Rules may affect the number of respondents for 14 Commission rules with
existing collections of information. The potential changes in burden under the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”) Control Numbers corresponding to the existing collections of
information are explained in more detail below. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the agency displays a
currently valid control number. If the new definitions in the Proposed Rules are adopted, the
Commission will submit change requests to OMB to update the number of respondents for these
14 other rules. The titles of these existing collections of information are:
 299 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

161
B. Proposed Use of Information
The existing information collections affected by the Proposed Rules are used as described
below:
1. Rules 15b1-1, 15Ca-1, 15Ca2-1, and 15b3-1 and Form BD
Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that it is unlawful for broker-dealers to
solicit or effect transactions in most securities unless they are registered as broker-dealers with
the Commission pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act. In addition, Section 15C(a)(1)
of the Exchange Act provides that it is unlawful for government securities broker-dealers, other
than registered broker-dealers and certain financial institutions, to solicit or effect transactions in
government securities unless they are registered as government securities broker-dealers with the
Commission pursuant to Section 15C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. To implement these
provisions, the Commission adopted Rules 15b1-1, 15Ca-1, and 15Ca2-1 and Form BD. In
addition, Rule 15b3-1 requires a broker-dealer to file amendments to Form BD only when
information originally reported in Form BD changes or becomes inaccurate.
The Commission uses the information disclosed by applicants in Form BD: (1) to
determine whether the applicant meets the standards for registration set forth in the provisions of
the Exchange Act; (2) to develop a central information resource where members of the public
may obtain relevant, up-to-date information about broker-dealers and government securities
broker-dealers, and where the Commission, other regulators, and SROs may obtain information
for investigatory purposes in connection with securities litigation; and (3) to develop statistical
information about broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers. Without the
information disclosed in Form BD, the Commission could not effectively implement policy
objectives of the Exchange Act with respect to its investor protection function.
162
2. Rules 15b6-1 and 15Cc-1 and Form BDW
Section 15(b)(5) of the Exchange Act provides that any broker-dealer may, upon such
terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of
withdrawal with the Commission. In addition, Section 15C(c)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act
provides that any government securities broker or government securities dealer may, upon such
terms and conditions as the Commission may deem necessary in the public interest or for the
protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with
the Commission. To implement the foregoing statutory provisions of the Exchange Act, the
Commission has promulgated Rules 15b6-1 and 15Cc1-1, as well as Form BDW, the uniform
request for broker-dealer withdrawal.
The Commission uses the information disclosed by applicants in Form BDW, as required
by Rules 15b6-1 and 15Cc1-1 to: (1) determine whether it is in the public interest to permit
broker-dealers and notice-registered broker-dealers to withdraw from registration; (2) develop
central information resources where the Commission and other government agencies and SROs
may obtain information for investigatory purposes in connection with securities litigation; and
(3) to develop statistical information about broker-dealers, notice-registered broker-dealers, and
government securities broker-dealers. Without Form BDW, the Commission, SROs, state
regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the public would be without an
important source of information regarding broker-dealers and notice-registered broker-dealers
that are seeking to withdraw from registration.
163
3. Rule 15c2-7
The information required by Rule 15c2-7 is necessary for the Commission’s mandate
under the Exchange Act to prevent fraud, manipulation and deceptive acts and practices. When
Rule 15c2-7 was adopted, the information it required was critical to the Commission’s role in
monitoring broker-dealers and protecting the integrity of over the counter markets. It was
through the disclosures required by Rule 15c2-7 that inter-dealer quotation systems would reflect
the demand for and market activity related to the securities quoted on these systems.
4. Rule 15c3-1
Rule 15c3-1 is intended to help ensure that broker-dealers maintain at all times sufficient
liquid resources to meet all liabilities by requiring that broker-dealers maintain a minimum
amount of net capital. A broker-dealer’s minimum net capital requirement is the greater of: (1) a
fixed minimum amount set forth in Rule 15c3-1 based on the types of business that the brokerdealer conducts; or (2) a financial ratio. Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3) and Rule 15c3-1
promulgated thereunder prohibit a broker-dealer from effecting transactions in securities while
not in compliance with its minimum net capital requirement.
Various provisions of Rule 15c3-1 require that broker-dealers provide written notification
to the Commission and/or their designated examining authority (“DEA”) under certain
circumstances. For example, a broker-dealer must send notice to the Commission if it withdraws
more than 10 percent or 20 percent of its excess net capital. In addition, a broker-dealer electing
to compute its net capital using the alternative method under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 15c3-1
must notify its DEA of the election in writing, and thereafter must continue to compute its net
capital in this manner unless a change is approved upon application to the Commission. Further,
there are special notification requirements for broker-dealers that carry the accounts of options
164
market makers to identify when the activities of those options market makers may impact the
financial stability of the carrying broker-dealer.
There are also certain recordkeeping requirements under Rule 15c3-1. For example, a
broker-dealer must keep a record of who is acting as an agent in a securities loan transaction and
records with respect to obtaining DEA approval prior to withdrawing capital within one year of a
contribution. These records help the Commission and its staff, as well as DEAs, facilitate the
monitoring of the financial condition of broker-dealers.
The provision at 17 CFR 240.15c3-1c (appendix C to Rule 15c3-1) requires brokerdealers that consolidate their financial statements with a subsidiary or affiliate, under certain
circumstances, to submit to their DEA an opinion of counsel. The opinion of counsel must state,
among other things, that the broker-dealer may cause that portion of the net assets of a subsidiary
or affiliate related to its ownership interest in the entity to be distributed to the broker-dealer
within 30 calendar days.
5. Rule 15c3-5
Rule 15c3-5 seeks to ensure that broker-dealers with market access appropriately control
the risks associated with market access, so as not to jeopardize their own financial condition, that
of other market participants, the integrity of trading on the securities markets, and the stability of
the financial system.303
6. Rule 17a-3
The purpose of requiring broker-dealers to create the records specified in Rule 17a-3 is to
enhance regulators’ ability to protect investors. These records and the information contained
therein will be and are used by examiners and other representatives of the Commission, State
 303 See 17 CFR 240.15c3-5(a)(1).
165
securities regulatory authorities, and the self-regulatory organizations (e.g., FINRA, CBOE, etc.)
(“SROs”) to determine whether broker-dealers are in compliance with the Commission’s
antifraud and anti-manipulation rules, financial responsibility program, and other Commission,
SRO, and State laws, rules, and regulations. If broker-dealers were not required to create these
records, Commission, SRO, and state examiners would be unable to conduct effective and
efficient examinations to determine whether broker-dealers were complying with relevant laws,
rules, and regulations.
7. Rule 17a-4
The purpose of requiring broker-dealers to maintain the records specified in Rule 17a-4 is
to help ensure that examiners and other representatives of the Commission, State securities
regulatory authorities, and SROs have access to the information and documents necessary to
determine whether broker-dealers are in compliance with the Commission’s antifraud and antimanipulation rules, financial responsibility program, and other Commission, SRO, and State
laws, rules, and regulations. Without Rule 17a-4, it would be impossible for the Commission to
determine whether a dealer that chose not to preserve records was in compliance with these rules.
Such a situation would not be in the public interest and would be detrimental to investors and the
financial community as a whole.
8. Rule 17a-5
Reports required to be made under Rule 17a-5 are used, among other things, to monitor
the financial and operational condition of a broker-dealer by Commission staff and by the
dealer’s DEA. The reports required under Rule 17a-5 are one of the primary means of ensuring
compliance with the financial responsibility rules. A firm’s failure to comply with these rules
would severely impair the ability of the Commission and the firm’s DEA to protect customers.
166
The reported data is used in preparation for broker-dealer examinations and inspections. The
completed forms also are used to determine which firms are engaged in various securities-related
activities, the extent to which they are engaged in those activities, and how economic events and
government policies might affect various segments of the securities industry.
9. Rule 17a-11
The information obtained under Rule 17a-11 is used to monitor the financial and
operational condition of a broker-dealer by the Commission staff, by the broker-dealer’s DEA
and, if applicable, by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). This information
alerts the Commission, the DEA, and the CFTC of the need to increase surveillance of the
broker-dealer’s financial and operational condition and to assist the broker-dealer to comply with
the Commission’s rules. No similar information is already available to use or modify for
purposes of complying with Rule 17a-11 because the disclosures required by the rule are
unobtainable until the early warning mechanisms are triggered. Only the most up-to-date
information will help the Commission, DEAs, and the CFTC to monitor broker-dealers
experiencing financial or operational difficulties.
10. Rule 613
Rule 613 creates a comprehensive CAT that allows regulators to efficiently and
accurately track all activity throughout the U.S. markets in certain securities.304 The rule
specifies the type of data to be collected and when the data is to be reported to a central
repository. The information collected and reported to the central repository improves the quality
of the data available to regulators and could be used by regulators to monitor and surveil the
securities markets and detect and investigate activity, whether on one market or across markets.
 304 See 17 CFR 242.613.
167
The data collected and reported to the central repository could also be used by regulators for the
evaluation of tips and complaints and for complex enforcement inquiries or investigations, as
well as inspections and examinations. Further, regulators could use the data collected and
reported to conduct more timely and accurate analysis of market activity for reconstruction of
broad-based market events in support of regulatory decisions.
C. Respondents
As discussed above, proposed Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2 would further define activities that
would cause a person engaged in the regular business of buying and selling securities for its own
account within the meaning of the Exchange Act. A person who satisfies any one of the factors
set forth in either of the Proposed Rules would be a dealer or government securities dealer and so
required to register, absent an exception or exemption.
1. Dealers
The qualitative factors identified in proposed Rule 3a5-4 would further define dealer
activity. The Commission estimates that for proposed Rule 3a5-4 the total number of
respondents that would register as a dealer would be approximately 51 persons.305 The
 305 This estimate is based on the analysis described in Section V.B.2. As identified in Table
4, the analysis indicates that between 41 and 61 CAT FDID institutional customer
accounts (depending on the thresholds used) had both low buy-sell dollar volume
imbalance in SPY and above de minimis total dollar volume in SPY in at least 14 of 21
trading days in October 2021. See Section V.B.2. Although there is currently no simple
one-to-one correspondence between the number of CAT FDID customer accounts that
satisfy various thresholds in Table 4 and the number of unregistered market participants
in the market (e.g., some unregistered market participants may have several CAT FDID
accounts, and some CAT FDID accounts may represent more than one customer), the
Commission believes that the analysis in Table 4 provides a useful indication about the
scope of a potential impact of proposed Rule 3a5-4 and has used the median of the results
at Table 4 to determine the number of approximate market participants that would
register as a dealer as a result of proposed Rule 3a5-4. Additionally, the Commission
recognizes that some of the 41 to 61 CAT FDID institutional customer accounts may be
168
Commission estimates that respondents will be subject to some or all of the following collections
of information as estimated below.
2. Government Securities Dealers
The Commission estimates that, as a result, for proposed Rule 3a44-2 the total number of
respondents that would register as a government securities dealer with the Commission would be
approximately 46 persons306 and that some of the respondents may elect to register as a dealer
under Section 15(a), rather than as a government securities dealer under Section 15C.
307 The
Commission estimates that respondents will be subject to some or all of the following collections
of information as estimated below.
D. Total PRA Burdens
1. Burden of Rules 15b1-1, 15Ca-1, 15Ca2-1, and 15b3-1 and Form BD
As discussed above, Section 15C of the Exchange Act requires government securities
dealers to register with the Commission.308 A government securities dealer has the flexibility to
either register as a dealer pursuant to Rule 15b1-1 and file notice as a government securities

held by registered investment companies that are excluded from the Proposed Rules.
306 This estimate is based on the analysis descried in Section V.B.2. That analysis found that
46 non-FINRA member firms would likely meet the proposed quantitative standard. The
Commission recognizes that some of these firms may be exempted from registration
(e.g., banks) or affiliated with other entities that are registered dealers, in which case a
parent entity could avoid the costs of registration by shifting the activities covered by the
Proposed Rules to the registered dealer affiliate.
307 See Section VI.D.1. Respondents that register with the Commission as a dealer or
government securities dealer file a Form BD. Respondents that are government securities
dealer are subject to the rules governing government securities dealers promulgated by
the U.S. Treasury at 17 CFR parts 400 through 499. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-5(b); see also 17
CFR parts 400 through 499. The Treasury Rules, for the most part, incorporate with
some modifications the Commission’s rules for government securities dealers that are not
financial institutions. See supra note 81.
308 See 15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a).
169
dealer under Rule 15Ca-1, or register as a government securities dealer under Rule 15Ca2-1.309
In either case, the respondent is required to complete a Form BD.
310 The Commission believes
that Proposed Rules would impose the same burden to the respondents irrespective of whether
the respondent registers as a dealer or a government securities dealer. Once registered, a brokerdealer must file an amended Form BD when information it originally reported on Form BD
changes or becomes inaccurate.311 The Commission estimates an initial burden of 2.75 hours312
for completing a Form BD and an annual burden of .95 hour313 per respondent for amending
 309 Compare 15 U.S.C. 78o(a) with 15 U.S.C. 78o–5(a). A government securities dealer that
registers under Section 15C(a)(l)(A) will be limited to conducting a government
securities business only.
310 Compare 17 CFR 240.15b1-1(a) (“An application for registration of a broker or dealer
that is filed pursuant to section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)) shall be filed on Form
BD (249.501 of this chapter) in accordance with the instructions to the form”) and 17
CFR 240.15Ca1-1(a) (“Every government securities broker or government securities
dealer that is a broker or dealer registered pursuant to section 15 or 15B of the Act (other
than a financial institution as defined in section 3(a)(46) of the Act) shall file with the
Commission written notice on Form BD (249.501 of this chapter) in accordance with the
instructions contained therein that it is a government securities broker or government
securities dealer.”) with 17 CFR 240.15Ca2-1(a) (“An application for registration
pursuant to Section 15C(a)(1)(A) of the Act, of a government securities broker or
government securities dealer that is filed on or after January 25, 1993, shall be filed with
the Central Registration Depository (operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.) on Form BD in accordance with the instructions contained therein.”).
311 See 17 CFR 240.15b3-1.
312 See Extension Without Change of a Currently Approved Collection: Form BD and Rule
15b1-1; Application for Registration as a Broker- Dealer; ICR Reference No. 201905-
3235-016; OMB Control No. 3235-0012 (Aug. 7, 2019), available at
https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201905-3235-016
(“Form BD PRA Supporting Statement”).
313 The Commission’s currently approved burden for the average ongoing compliance
burden for each respondent amending Form BD is .95 hours (Compliance Manager at
0.33 hours x 2.87 amendments per year). See Form BD PRA Supporting Statement at 5.
170
Form BD, resulting in a total initial burden of 266.75 hours314 and a total annual burden of 76.95
hours.315
In addition, the Commission believes that a respondent’s compliance manager would
complete and file the application and amendments on Form BD at $314/hour.316 Consequently,
the Commission estimates that the internal cost of compliance associated with these burden
hours for the respondents is approximately an initial burden of $83,759.50317 and an annual
burden of $28,935.10.
318 It is not anticipated that respondents will have to incur any capital and
start-up costs, nor any additional operational or maintenance costs, to comply with the collection
of information.319
2. Burden of Rules 15b6-1 and 15Cc-1 and Form BDW
The time necessary to complete and file Form BDW will vary depending on the nature
and complexity of the applicant’s securities business. On average, the Commission estimates
that it would take a broker-dealer approximately one hour320 per respondent to complete and file
a Form BDW to withdraw from Commission registration. The Commission estimates that at
 314 97 respondents multiplied by 2.75 hours per respondent.

(“Form BDW Supporting Statement”).
171
least one of the 97 respondents will withdraw as a dealer, resulting in a total annual burden of
one hour.321 The Commission believes that a respondent would have a compliance officer, at
$536 per hour, complete and file the Form BDW to withdraw from Commission registration.322
Accordingly, the Commission estimates an internal compliance cost associated with the burden
hours for the respondents is approximately $536.
323 It is not anticipated that respondents will
have to incur any capital and start-up costs, nor any additional operational or maintenance costs,
to comply with the collection of information.324
3. Burden of Rule 15c2-7
Any broker-dealer could be a potential respondent for Rule 15c2-7. Only quotations
entered into an inter-dealer quotation system such as OTC Link, OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB),
and Global OTC, are covered by Rule 15c2-7. According to representatives of OTC Link,
Global OTC, and the OTCBB, none of those entities has recently received, nor anticipates
receiving, any Rule 15c2-7 notices.325 However, because such notices could be made, the
Commission estimates that one filing, in the aggregate, by only one broker-dealer, is made
annually pursuant to Rule 15c2-7.326 Based on prior industry estimates, the time required to

enter a notice pursuant to Rule 15c2-7 is 45 seconds, or .75 minutes.327 The Commission
believes that there will not be any respondents that are required to register as a result of the
Proposed Rules that must file a Rule 15c2-7 notice as a result of the Proposed Rules.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that there will be no internal compliance cost associated
with the burden hours for Rule 15c2-7.
4. Burden of Rule 15c3-1
Some of the respondents that would register with the Commission as a result of the
Proposed Rules would likely incur a collection of information burden to comply with Rule 15c3-
1. The Commission estimates the hour burdens of the requirements associated with Rule 15c3-1
as follows.
Notices: Based on the number of notices filed under Rule 15c3-1 in 2019, the
Commission estimates that broker-dealers annually file approximately 844 notices under Rule
15c3-1 and that a broker-dealer will spend approximately 30 minutes preparing and filing these
notices.328 The Commission estimates that at least approximately 23 of the 97 respondents

https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201912-3235-005
(“Rule 15c3-1 PRA Supporting Statement”).
173
would likely each file one notice under Rule 15c3-1, for a total of 23 notices.
329 Accordingly the
Commission estimates a total additional annual burden of approximately 11.5 hours.330
Capital Withdrawal Liability: Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1 requires that a
broker-dealer treat as a liability any capital contribution that is intended to be withdrawn within
one year of its contribution. The amendment also includes the presumption that capital
withdrawn within one year of contribution is presumed to have been intended to be withdrawn
within one year, unless the broker-dealer receives permission in writing for the withdrawal from
its DEA. The Commission estimates it will take a broker-dealer approximately one hour to
prepare and submit the request to its DEA to withdraw capital,
331 and that at least approximately
two respondents would likely seek permission in writing one occasion for the capital
withdrawal.332 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total annual reporting burden
will be approximately two hours.333
 329 The Commission estimated that as of June 2019 broker-dealers submitted approximately
844 notices annually. Rule 15c3-1 PRA Supporting Statement at 4. The number of
active broker-dealers on June 30, 2019 was 3,710. Thus, approximately 23 percent of the
active broker-dealers submitted a notice annually as of June 2019. Based on this, the
Commission estimates that the 97 respondents that would need to register with the
Commission under the Proposed Rules would file approximately 23 notices annually.
330 23 respondents multiplied by .5 hours per respondent.
331 Rule 15c3-1 PRA Supporting Statement at 5.
332 The Commission estimated that as of June 2019 broker-dealers submitted approximately
84 notices annually. Rule 15c3-1 PRA Supporting Statement at 5. The number of active
broker-dealers on June 30, 2019 was 3,710. Thus, approximately .02 percent of the
active broker-dealers submitted a notice annually as of June 2019. Based on this, the
Commission estimates that the 97 respondents that would need to register with the
Commission under the Proposed Rules would file approximately two notices annually.
333 Two respondents multiplied by 1 hour per respondent.
174
Some broker-dealers that file consolidated financial reports obtain an opinion of counsel
under appendix C of Rule 15c3-1.334 The Commission believes that there will not be any
respondents that are required to register as a result of the Proposed Rules that will obtain an
opinion of counsel to file the consolidated financial reports as required under appendix C of Rule
15c3-1. It is not anticipated that respondents will have to incur any capital and start-up costs, nor
any additional operational or maintenance costs, to comply with the collection of information.
5. Burden of Rule 15c3-5
To comply with Rule 15c3-5, a respondent must maintain its risk management system by
monitoring its effectiveness and updating its systems to address any issues detected.335 In
addition, a respondent is required to preserve a copy of its written description of its risk
management controls as part of its books and records in a manner consistent with Rule 17a4(e)(7) under the Exchange Act.336 The Commission estimates that the ongoing annualized
burden for a respondent to maintain its risk management system will be approximately 115
burden hours.
337 The Commission estimates the related internal compliance cost for this hour
burden per respondent at approximately $31,717 per year.338 The Commission believes the
ongoing burden of complying with the rule’s collection of information will include, among other
 334 Rule 15c3-1 PRA Supporting Statement at 11.

things, updating systems to address any issues detected, updating risk management controls to
reflect any change in its business model, and documenting and preserving a broker-dealer’s
written description of its risk management controls.339 In addition, the Commission estimates
that a broker-dealer’s legal and compliance burden of complying with Rule 15c3-5 will require
approximately 45 hours per year.340 The Commission estimates the related internal compliance
cost for this hour burden per respondent at approximately $25,645 per year.341
Accordingly, the Commission estimates the annual aggregate information burden per
respondent would be 160 hours, 342 for a total annual burden of 15,520 hours.
343 The
Commission estimates the related total internal compliance cost for the respondents required to
register as a result of the Proposed Rules for this hour burden at approximately $5,564,114 per
year.
344 In addition, the Commission estimates that for hardware and software expenses, the
average ongoing external cost would be approximately $20,500 per respondent,345 for a total
annualized external cost for all respondents of $1,988,500.

6. Burden of Rule 17a-3
As discussed above, the respondents that would register as dealers or government
securities as a result of the Proposed Rules would incur a burden of collection of information
necessary to comply with Rule 17a-3. While recordkeeping requirements will vary based on the
size and complexity of the broker- dealer, the Commission estimates that one hour a day347 is the
average amount of time needed by a broker-dealer to comply with the overall requirements of
Rule 17a-3, in addition to the separate burdens described below. The number of working days
per year is 249, and as a result the total annual estimated burden for respondents with respect to
Rule 17a-3 generally is 24,153 hours.348
(i) Rule 17a-3(a)(12) and (19)
In addition to the hour burden estimate for Rule 17a-3 generally, the Commission also
believes that paragraphs (a)(12) and (19) of Rule 17a-3 will impose specific burdens on
respondents. Paragraphs (a)(12) and (19) of Rule 17a-3 require that a broker-dealer create
certain records regarding its associated persons.349 The Commission estimates that each broker-

(“Rule 17a-3 PRA Supporting Statement”).
348 97 respondents multiplied by 249 hours per respondent a year.
349 These records that a broker-dealer is required to make regarding the broker-dealer’s
associated persons include: (1) all agreements pertaining to the associated person’s
relationship with the broker-dealer and a summary of each associated person’s
compensation arrangement (17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(19)(ii)), (2) a record delineating all
identification numbers relating to each associated person (17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(12)(ii)),
(3) a record of the office at which each associated person regularly conducts business (17
CFR 240.17a-3(a)(12)(iii)), and 4) a record as to each associated person listing
transactions for which that person will be compensated (17 CFR 240.17a3(a)(19)(i)).
177
dealer spends, on average, approximately 30 minutes each year350 to ensure that it is in
compliance with these requirements, resulting in a total annual compliance burden of
approximately 48.5 hours for the respondents.
351
(ii) Rule 17a-3(a)(20) through (22)
Paragraphs (a)(20) through (22) of Rule 17a-3 require broker-dealers to make, among
other things, records documenting the broker-dealer’s compliance, or that the broker-dealer has
adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish compliance, with applicable
Federal regulations and SRO rules that require approval by a principal of the broker-dealer of
any advertisements, sales literature or other communications with the public.352 Moreover, these
rules require broker-dealers to create a record of the personnel responsible for establishing
compliance policies and procedures and of the personnel capable of explaining the types of
records the broker-dealer.353 The Commission estimates that, on average, each broker-dealer
will spend 10 minutes each year354 to ensure compliance with these requirements, resulting in a
total annual burden for the respondents of about approximately 16 hours.355
7. Burden of Rule 17a-4
The respondents that registered as dealers or government securities would incur a
collection of information burden to comply with Rule 17a-4. Rule 17a-4 establishes the records

that must be preserved by broker-dealers.
356 The Commission estimates that, on average, each
broker-dealer spends 254 hours each year357 to ensure that it preserves the records Rule 17a-4
requires all broker-dealers to preserve. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that there will be
a total annual burden of 24,638 hours to comply with the Rule 17a-4 requirements applicable to
the respondents.
358 The Commission estimates that the average broker-dealer spends
approximately $5,000 each year to store documents required to be retained under Rule 17a-4.359
Accordingly, the Commission estimates the annual reporting and recordkeeping cost burden for
the respondents to be $485,000.
360
8. Burden of Rule 17a-5361
This section summarizes the burdens associated with Rule 17a-5.
FOCUS Report for Broker-Dealers that do not Clear Transactions or Carry
Customer Accounts:
Rule 17a-5(a)(2)(iii) requires that broker-dealers that do not clear transactions or carry
customer accounts and do not use ANC models to calculate net capital are required to file
 356 See 17 CFR 240.17a-4.
357 See Revision of a currently approved collection: Rule 17a-4; Records to be Preserved by

179
FOCUS Report Part IIA on a quarterly basis.362 The Commission believes that the 97
respondents that would be required to register with the Commission would need to comply with
this provision of Rule 17a-5. The Commission estimates that each FOCUS Report Part IIA takes
approximately 12 hours to prepare and file.
363 As a result, each respondent is estimated to have
an annual reporting burden of 48 hours,364 resulting in an annual burden of 4,656 hours.365
Annual Reports: Rule 17a-5(d)(1)(i)(A) requires broker-dealers, subject to limited
exception, to file annual reports, including financial statements and supporting schedules that
generally must be audited by a PCAOB-registered independent public accountant in accordance
with PCAOB standards. The Commission believes that the 97 respondents that would be
required to register with the Commission would be need to file an annual report. The
Commission estimates that each respondent is estimated to have an annual reporting burden of
12 hours under Rule 17a-5(d),366 resulting in an annual burden of 1,164 hours for the
respondents.
367
Exemption Report: Rule 17a-5(d)(1)(i)(B) requires a broker-dealer that claims it was
exempt from 17 CFR 240.15c3-3 (Rule 15c3-3) throughout the most recent fiscal year must file

an exemption report with the Commission on an annual basis.368 As of December 31, 2019,
3,689 broker-dealers filed FOCUS Reports with the Commission and, of these, 3,001 brokerdealers claimed exemptions from Rule 15c3-3.369 The Commission estimates that it takes a
broker-dealer claiming an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 approximately 7 hours to complete the
exemption report.370 The Commission also estimates that approximately 78 of the 97
respondents371 would also claim exemptions from Rule 15c3-3 and be required to file an
exemption report, resulting in an annual burden of 546 hours.372
SIPC Annual Reports: Paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 requires a Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) member broker-dealers to file a copy of the annual reports with
SIPC.373 The Commission estimates that it takes a broker-dealer approximately 30 minutes to
file the annual reports with SIPC.374 As a result, each firm is estimated to have an annual burden
of .5 hour, resulting in an annual burden of 48.5 hours for the respondents.

exemptions from Rule 15c3-3 as of December 31, 2019 applies to the 97 respondents that
would register with the Commission as a result of the Proposed Rules. Accordingly, the
Commission estimates that 80 percent of the 97 respondents would file an exemption
report under Rule 17a-5(d)(1)(i)(A).
372 78 respondents multiplied by 7 hours per respondent.

Paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 requires broker-dealers to file with SIPC a report on the
SIPC annual general assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership forms.376 The
Commission estimates that it takes a broker-dealer approximately 5 hours to file SIPC’s annual
assessment reconciliation form or certification of exclusion from membership forms,377 resulting
in an estimated annual burden of about 485 hours for the respondents.
378
Statement Regarding Independent Public Accountant: Paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5
requires broker-dealers to prepare a statement providing information regarding the brokerdealer’s independent public accountant and to file it each year with the Commission and its DEA
(except that if the engagement is of a continuing nature, no further filing is required).379 The
Commission estimates that it takes a broker-dealer that neither carries customer accounts nor
clears transactions approximately 2 hours to file the Statement Regarding Independent Public
Accountant with the Commission.380 As a result, each broker-dealer that neither carries nor
clears transactions is estimated to have an annual burden of 2 hours, resulting in an annual
burden of 194 hours for the respondents.
381
The Commission estimates that Rule 17a-5 causes a broker-dealer to incur an annual
dollar cost to meet its reporting obligations. Those requirements that are anticipated to impose
an annual cost are discussed below.

Annual Reports: The Commission estimates that postage costs to comply with
paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 impose on broker-dealers an annual dollar cost of $7.75 per firm,382
resulting in a total annual cost for the respondents of approximately $751.75.
383
Exemption Report: A broker-dealer that claims it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3
throughout the most recent fiscal year must file an exemption report with the Commission on an
annual basis.384 The cost associated with an independent public accountant’s review of the
exemption report is estimated to create an ongoing cost of $3,000 per non-carrying broker-dealer
per year,385 for a total annual reporting cost of approximately $234,000.
386
SIPC Annual Reports: The Commission estimates that postage costs to comply with
paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 impose an annual dollar cost of 50 cents per firm registered with
SIPC as a SIPC member broker-dealer,387 totaling for the 97 respondents an estimated cost
burden for the response of $48.50.
388
SIPC Annual General Assessment Reconciliation Report or Exclusion from
Membership Forms:
The Commission estimates that postage costs to comply with paragraph (e)(4) of Rule
17a-5, impose an annual dollar cost of 50 cents per firm.389 The Commission estimates that each

Statement Regarding Independent Public Accountant: The Commission estimates
that postage costs to comply with paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of Rule 17a-5, impose an annual
dollar cost of 50 cents per firm.391 Accordingly, the Commission estimates a total cost of $48.50
per year for the 97 respondents.392
9. Burden of Rule 17a-11
In 2019, the Commission received 343 Rule 17a-11 notices from broker-dealers.393 The
Commission previously estimated that it would receive a similar number of notices from brokerdealers each year over the next three years and that it will take approximately one hour to
prepare and transmit each notice.394 The Commission believes that the Proposed Rules would
not cause any change to the Commission’s estimated number of 17a-11 notices received from
broker-dealers.

10. Burden of Rule 613
Rule 613(c) provides that certain requirements are placed upon broker-dealers to record
and report CAT information to the central repository in accordance with specified timelines.395
The Commission recognizes that broker-dealers may insource or outsource CAT data reporting
obligations.
396 The Commission believes all 97 respondents would likely have reporting
obligations under Rule 613 and strategically decide to insource their data reporting functions as a
result of their high level of trading activity.397 The Commission estimates that the average initial
burden associated with implementing regulatory data reporting to capture the required
information and transmit it to the central repository in compliance with Rule 613 for each
respondent to be approximately 14,490 initial burden hours,398 totaling an initial burden of
1,405,530 hours for the respondents.399 After a respondent establishes the appropriate systems
and processes required for collection and transmission of the required information, the
Commission estimates that Rule 613 imposes ongoing annual burdens associated with, among
other things, personnel time to monitor each respondent’s reporting of the required data and the
maintenance of the systems to report the required data; and implementing changes to trading
systems that might result in additional reports.400 The Commission believes that it would take
 395 17 CFR 242.613(c).

Plan Required to be Filed under Commission Rule 613); ICR Reference No: 201911-

185
each respondent approximately 13,338 burden hours per year401 to continue to comply with Rule
613, totaling an annual ongoing burden of 1,293,786 hours for the respondents.
402
Additionally, the Commission estimates that each respondent, on average, incurs
approximately $450,000 in initial costs for hardware and software to implement the systems
changes needed to capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository, an
additional $9,500 in initial third party costs, and an additional $250,000 in costs to implement the
modified allocation timestamp requirement,403 totaling an initial cost of $68,821,500 for the
respondents.404 After each respondent has established the appropriate systems and processes, the
Commission believes that Rule 613 imposes ongoing annual burdens associated with, among
other things, personnel time to monitor each respondent’s reporting of the required data and the
maintenance of the systems to report the required data; and implementing changes to trading
systems that might result in additional reports to the central repository.405 The Commission
estimates costs for each respondent, on average, of approximately $80,000 per year to maintain
systems connectivity to the central repository and purchase any necessary hardware, software,
and other materials, an additional $1,300 per year in third party costs, and an additional

$29,166.67 per year to maintain the modified allocation timestamp requirement,406 totaling an
estimated annual ongoing cost of $10,715,268 for the respondents.407
E. Request for Comments
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits comments to:
79. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the
proper performance of the Commission’s functions, including whether the
information shall have practical utility;
80. Evaluate whether the Commission is adequately capturing the number of
respondents that would be subject to the burdens under the Proposed Rules;
81. Evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimates of the burden of the
proposed collection of information;
82. Evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimates of the costs associated with
the proposed collection of information, including but not limited to any start-up,
technology, personnel, legal services, operational, or maintenance costs, to
comply with the collection of information;
83. Evaluate whether the Proposed Rules would have any effects on any other
collection of information not previously identified in this section; and
84. Determine whether any aspects of the Proposed Rules that are not discussed in
this PRA analysis impact the burden or costs associated with the collection of
information.
 406 Id.
407 97 respondents multiplied by (($80,000 in external hardware and software costs) +
($29,166.67 to maintain the modified allocation timestamp requirement) + ($1,300
ongoing external third party/outsourcing costs) = $110,466.68).
187
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct
them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and should also send a copy of their comments to Vanessa Countryman, Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File
Number S7-12-22. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to
this collection of information should be in writing, with reference to File Number S7-12-22 and
be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA/PA Services, 100 F
Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-2736. As OMB is required to make a decision concerning the
collection of information between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to OMB is best
assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
VII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires Federal agencies, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act,408 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to determine
the impact of the rulemaking on “small entities.”409 Section 605(b) of the RFA410 states that this
 408 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
409 Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits
agencies to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for
the term “small entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with
the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in 17
CFR 240.0-10 (Rule 0-10 under the Exchange Act). See also Exchange Act Release No.
18451 (Jan. 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (Feb. 4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).
410 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
188
requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment which, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.411
The RFA defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small organization,” or
“small governmental jurisdiction.”412 The Commission’s rules define “small business” and
“small organization “for purpose of the RFA for each of the types of entities regulated by the
Commission.413 A “small business” and “small organization,” when used in reference to a
person other than an investment company, generally means a person with total assets of $5
million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year.414
The Proposed Rules would not apply to persons that have or control total assets of less
than $50 million.415 Therefore, because small businesses and small organizations with total
assets of $5 million or less would not meet the requirements of the Proposed Rules, the
Commission believes the Proposed Rules would not, if adopted, have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the
Proposed Rules, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities for purposes of the RFA. The Commission encourages written
comments regarding this certification. Specifically, the Commission solicits comment as to
whether the proposed Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2 could have an effect on small entities that has not
 411 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

been considered. We request that commenters describe the nature of any impact on small entities
and provide empirical data to support the extent of such impact. These comments will be
considered in the preparation of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Certification, if the Proposed
Rules are adopted, and will be placed in the same public file as comments on the Proposed
Rules. Persons wishing to submit written comments should refer to the instructions for
submitting comments in the front of this release.
VIII. Consideration of Impact on the Economy
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996,416
the Commission requests comment on the potential effect of the Proposed Rules on the United
States economy on an annual basis. The Commission also requests comment on any potential
increases in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries, and any potential effect on
competition, investment, or innovation.
Statutory Basis and Text of the Proposed Rules
