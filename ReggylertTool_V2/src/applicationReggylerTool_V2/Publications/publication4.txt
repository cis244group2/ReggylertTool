The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is proposing for
public comment amendments to its rules under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) that would require registrants to provide
certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The
proposed rules would require information about a registrant’s climate-related risks that are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial
condition. The required information about climate-related risks would also include disclosure of
a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions, which have become a commonly used metric to assess a
registrant’s exposure to such risks. In addition, under the proposed rules, certain climate-related
financial metrics would be required in a registrant’s audited financial statements.
DATES: Comments should be received on or before May 20, 2022.

I. INTRODUCTION
We are proposing to require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in
their registration statements and annual reports, including certain information about climaterelated financial risks and climate-related financial metrics in their financial statements. The
disclosure of this information would provide consistent, comparable, and reliable—and therefore
decision-useful—information to investors to enable them to make informed judgments about the
impact of climate-related risks on current and potential investments.
The Commission has broad authority to promulgate disclosure requirements that are
“necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.”3
 We have
considered this statutory standard and determined that disclosure of information about climaterelated risks and metrics would be in the public interest and would protect investors. In making
this determination, we have also considered whether the proposed disclosures “will promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation.”4
We are proposing to require disclosures about climate-related risks and metrics reflecting
those risks because this information can have an impact on public companies’ financial
performance or position and may be material to investors in making investment or voting
decisions. For this reason, many investors—including shareholders, investment advisers, and
investment management companies—currently seek information about climate-related risks from
companies to inform their investment decision-making. Furthermore, many companies have
3 See, e.g., Section 7 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77g] and Sections 12, 13, and 15 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. 78l, 78m, and 78o].
4 See, e.g., Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
78c(f)].
8
begun to provide some of this information in response to investor demand and in recognition of
the potential financial effects of climate-related risks on their businesses.
We are concerned that the existing disclosures of climate-related risks do not adequately
protect investors. For this reason, we believe that additional disclosure requirements may be
necessary or appropriate to elicit climate-related disclosures and to improve the consistency,
comparability, and reliability of climate-related disclosures. With respect to their existing
climate-related disclosures (to the extent registrants are already disclosing such information),
registrants often provide information outside of Commission filings and provide different
information, in varying degrees of completeness, and in different documents and formats—
meaning that the same information may not be available to investors across different companies.
This could result in increased costs to investors in obtaining useful climate-related information
and impair the ability to make investment or voting decisions in line with investors’ risk
preferences. Also, companies may not disclose certain information needed to understand their
existing climate-related disclosures, such as the methodologies, data sources, assumptions, and
other key parameters used to assess climate-related risks. To the extent companies primarily
provide this information separate from their financial reporting, it may be difficult for investors
to determine whether a company’s financial disclosures are consistent with its climate-related
disclosures.5
 In addition, the information provided outside of Commission filings is not subject
to the full range of liability and other investor protections that help elicit complete and accurate
disclosure by public companies.

https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/seven-esg-trends-to-watch-in-2021. This study found
that approximately 90% of S&P 500 companies publish sustainability reports but only 16% include any
reference to ESG factors in their Commission filings.
9
Investors need information about climate-related risks—and it is squarely within the
Commission’s authority to require such disclosure in the public interest and for the protection of
investors—because climate-related risks have present financial consequences that investors in
public companies consider in making investment and voting decisions.
6
 Investors have noted
that climate-related inputs have many uses in the capital allocation decision-making process
including, but not limited to, insight into governance and risks management practices,7
integration into various valuation models, and credit research and assessments.8 Further, we
understand investors often employ diversified strategies, and therefore do not necessarily
consider risk and return of a particular security in isolation but also in terms of the security’s
effect on the portfolio as a whole, which requires comparable data across registrants.9
While climate-related risks implicate broader concerns—and are subject to various other
regulatory schemes—our objective is to advance the Commission’s mission to protect investors,

2021) (“2021 FSOC Report”), available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-ClimateReport.pdf (detailing the myriad ways that climate-related risks pose financial threats both at the firm level and
financial system level). See also Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System, Report of the ClimateRelated Market Risk Subcommittee, Market Risk Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading

need to consider its risk and return characteristics not in isolation, but in terms of the asset’s effect on the
portfolio as a whole, and providing CalPERS as an example of an asset owner holding a diversified growthoriented portfolio that has integrated climate risk assessment into its investment process); see also letter from
Amalgamated Bank (stating that the principal mitigant of investment risk is diversity of exposure and indicating
that comprehensive climate disclosures help investors assess systemic risk); and Norges Bank Investment
Management (stating that for sustainability information to support investment decisions, risk management
processes, and ownership activities across a diversified portfolio, it must be consistent and comparable across
companies and over time).

maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and promote capital formation, not to address
climate-related issues more generally. In particular, the impact of climate-related risks on both
individual businesses and the financial system as a whole are well documented.10
 For example,
the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (“FSOC’s”) Report on Climate-Related Financial
Risk 2021 found that businesses, financial institutions, investors, and households may experience
direct financial effects from climate-related risks, and observed that the costs would likely be
broadly felt as they are passed through supply chains and to customers and as they reduce firms’
ability to service debt or produce returns for investors.11
 As a result, these climate-related risks
and their financial impact could negatively affect the economy as a whole and create systemic

United States, surpassing the previous annual highs of 16 such events set in 2011 and 2017. See NOAA,
National Center for Environmental Information, Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Summary Stats

 SEC-reporting companies and their investors are an essential

Climate-related risks can affect a company’s business and its financial performance and

operations, and increase costs.14

(stating that these effects would likely propagate through the financial sector, which may experience credit and
market risks associated with loss of income, defaults and changes in the values of assets, liquidity risks
associated with changing demand for liquidity, and operational risks associated with disruptions to
infrastructure). See also Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), The Implications of Climate Change for Financial
Stability (Nov. 2020) (stating that climate-related effects may be far-reaching in their breadth and magnitude,
and could affect a wide variety of firms, sectors and geographies in a highly correlated manner, indicating that
the value of financial assets/liabilities could be affected either by the actual or expected economic effects of a
continuation of climate-related physical risks, which could lead to a sharp fall in asset prices and increase in
uncertainty, or by risks associated with a transition towards a low-carbon economy, particularly if the transition
is disorderly, which could have a destabilizing effect on the global financial system). See also Basel Committee

environmental risks, in particular those related to climate change. To that end, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is rightly working on climate-risk disclosure rules, so investors will have the information they need
to make the best possible decisions and to hold public companies accountable.”).

climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century to well below 2º Celsius above pre-industrial
levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5º degrees Celsius. See Paris
Agreement (Paris, Dec. 12, 2015) (entered into force Nov. 4, 2016). Moreover, at the UN Climate Change
Conference (COP 26), the United States committed to become net zero by 2050, China by 2060, and India by
2070. Further, over 100 countries formed a coalition to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. See

 How a company assesses and plans for climate-related risks may have a
significant impact on its future financial performance and investors’ return on their investment in
the company.
Consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures on the material climate-related risks
public companies face would serve both investors and capital markets. Investors would be able
to use this information to make investment or voting decisions in line with their risk preferences.
Capital allocation would become more efficient as investors are better able to price climaterelated risks. In addition, more transparency and comparability in climate-related disclosures
would foster competition. Many other jurisdictions and financial regulators around the globe
have taken action or reached similar conclusions regarding the importance of climate-related
disclosures and are also moving towards the adoption of climate-related disclosure standards.20
This proposal builds on the Commission’s previous rules and guidance on climate-related
disclosures, which date back to the 1970s. In 2010, in response to increasing calls by the public
and shareholders for public companies to disclose information regarding how climate change
may affect their business and operations, the Commission published guidance (“2010 Guidance”)
for registrants on how the Commission’s existing disclosure rules may require disclosure of the
impacts of climate change on a registrant’s business or financial condition.21
 Since that time, as

related risks to businesses and the economy has grown,22 investors have increased their demand
for more detailed information about the effects of the climate on a registrant’s business and for
more information about how a registrant has addressed climate-related risks and opportunities
when conducting its operations and developing its business strategy and financial plans.23
 It is
appropriate for us to consider such investor demand in exercising our authority and responsibility
to design an effective and efficient disclosure regime under the federal securities laws.
In developing these proposals, we have considered the feedback we have received to date
from a wide range of commenters, including comments from investors as to the information they
need to make informed investment or voting decisions, as well as concerns expressed by
registrants with regard to compliance burdens and liability risk.24
 While our proposals include
disclosure requirements designed to foster greater consistency, comparability, and reliability of
available information, they also include a number of features designed to mitigate the burdens on

registrants, such as phase-in periods for the proposed climate-related disclosure requirements,25 a
safe harbor for certain emissions disclosures,26 and an exemption from certain emissions
reporting requirements for smaller reporting companies.27 In addition, the existing safe harbors
for forward-looking statements under the Securities Act and Exchange Act would be available
for aspects of the proposed disclosures.28
Although the various requirements we are proposing are supported by overlapping
rationales, we emphasize that the different aspects of the proposal serve independent, albeit
complementary, objectives. In addition, we have carefully considered how to craft this proposal
to best advance investor protection and the public interest, consistent with the Commission’s
disclosure authority and regulatory mission, and we welcome comments on how we can further
achieve that goal.
A. Background
The Commission first addressed the disclosure of material environmental issues in the
early 1970s when it issued an interpretive release stating that registrants should consider
disclosing in their SEC filings the financial impact of compliance with environmental laws.
29

Throughout the 1970s, the Commission continued to explore the need for specific rules
mandating disclosure of information relating to litigation and other business costs arising out of
25 See infra Section II.M.
26 See Section II.G.3.
27 See id.
28 See Securities Act Section 27A [15 U.S.C. 77z-2] and Exchange Act Section 21E [15 U.S.C. 78u-5]. We
discuss the application of the existing forward-looking statement safe harbors to the proposed climate-related
disclosures primarily in Sections II.C.3-4, II.E, II.G.1, and II.I.
29 See Release No. 33-5170 (July 19, 1971) [36 FR 13989]. The Commission codified this interpretive position in
its disclosure forms two years later. See Release 33-5386 (Apr. 20, 1973) [38 FR 12100] (“1972
Amendments”).
16
compliance with federal, state, and local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. These topics were the
subject of several rulemaking efforts, extensive litigation, and public hearings, all of which
resulted in the rules that now specifically address disclosure of environmental issues.30
After almost a decade of consideration, the Commission adopted rules in 1982 mandating
disclosure of information relating to litigation and other business costs arising out of compliance
with federal, state, and local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relate to the protection of the environment.31
 In addition to these specific disclosure
requirements, the Commission’s other disclosure rules requiring, for example, information about
material risks and a description of the registrant’s business, could give rise to an obligation to
provide disclosure related to the effects of climate change.32
30 See Interpretive Release No. 33-6130 (Sept. 27, 1979) [44 FR 56924], which includes a brief summary of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the legal and administrative actions taken with regard to the
Commission’s environmental disclosure during the 1970s. See also NRDC v. SEC, 606 F.2d 1031, 1036-42
(DC Cir. 1979) (discussing this history). More information relating to the Commission's efforts in this area is
chronicled in Release No. 33-6315 (May 4, 1981) [46 FR 25638].
31 See Release No. 33-6383 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380] (“1982 Release”) (adopting 17 CFR 229.103, which
requires a registrant to describe its material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation
incidental to the business, and indicating that administrative or judicial proceedings arising under federal, state,
or local law regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting
the environment, shall not be deemed “ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business” and must be
described if meeting certain conditions). The 1982 Release also moved the information called for by the 1973
Amendments to 17 CFR 229.101(c)(1)(xii), which, as part of a registrant’s business description, required the
disclosure of the material effects that compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have had
upon the registrant’s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, as well as the disclosure of its
material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. In 2020, the Commission amended
17 CFR 229.101(c)(1) to require, to the extent material to an understanding of the business taken as a whole,
disclosure of the material effects that compliance with government regulations, including environmental
regulations, may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the registrant and its
subsidiaries. See Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105, Release No. 33-10825 (Aug. 26,
2020) [85 FR 63726 (Oct. 8, 2020)] (“2020 Release”).
32 See Release No. 33-9106, Section III.
17
In its 2010 Guidance, the Commission observed that, in response to investor demand for
climate-related information, many companies were voluntarily reporting climate-related
information outside their filings with the Commission. The Commission emphasized that
“registrants should be aware that some of the information they may be reporting pursuant to
these mechanisms also may be required to be disclosed in filings made with the Commission
pursuant to existing disclosure requirements.”33 Specifically, the 2010 Guidance emphasized
that climate change disclosure might, depending on the circumstances, be required in a
company’s Description of Business, Risk Factors, Legal Proceedings, and Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).
34
 The
2010 Guidance further identified certain climate-related issues that companies may need to
consider in making their disclosures, including the direct and indirect impact of climate-related
legislation or regulations, international agreements, indirect consequences of business trends
including changing demand for goods, and the physical impacts of climate change.
The proposals set forth in this release would augment and supplement the disclosures
already required in SEC filings. Accordingly, registrants should continue to evaluate the
climate-related risks they face and assess whether disclosures related to those climate-related
risks must be disclosed in their Description of Business, Risk Factors, Legal Proceedings, and
MD&A as described in the 2010 Guidance. These disclosures should be based on the
registrant’s specific facts and circumstances. While climate risks impact many issuers across
industries, the impacts of those risks on a particular registrant and how the registrant addresses
33 See Release No. 33-9106, Section I.
34 The 2010 Guidance also applies to corresponding disclosure requirements in Form 20-F by foreign private
issuers.
18
those risks are fact-specific and may vary significantly by registrant.
35 The disclosures required
by our existing rules should reflect these company-specific risks.
B. The March 2021 Request for Public Input
On March 15, 2021, Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee requested public input on climate
disclosure from investors, registrants, and other market participants.
36
 The Acting Chair
solicited input on several issues, including how the Commission could best regulate disclosure
concerning climate change in order to provide more consistent, comparable, and reliable
information for investors, whether the Commission should require the disclosure of certain
metrics and other climate-related information, the role that existing third-party climate-related
disclosure frameworks should play in the Commission’s regulation of such disclosure, and
whether and how such disclosure should be subject to assurance.
The Commission received approximately 600 unique letters and over 5800 form letters in
response to the Acting Chair’s request for public input.37
 We received letters from academics,
accounting and audit firms, individuals, industry groups, investor groups, registrants, nongovernmental organizations, professional climate advisors, law firms, professional investment
35 Our recent amendments to Item 105 of Regulation S-K discourage the presentation of generic risks that could
apply generally to any registrant or offering. The fact that climate risks are broad-based does not, in our view,
cause them to be generic. For example, thousands of companies in Houston were impacted by Hurricane
Harvey. However, (1) their flood risk varied and some companies may have been far more impacted than
others (and would be more vulnerable to future catastrophic storms); (2) their operations were different and
some may have been more disrupted as a result than others—e.g., a services business on the 10th floor of a
building may have experienced just a few days of disruption while an oil refinery may have been shut down for
weeks; and (3) their risk management processes may have been different—two similarly situated companies
may have different continuity of operations plans or may have taken steps to mitigate those types of risks. In
sum, while the source of the risk may be common to many companies, the impact is not.

advisors and investment management companies, standard-setters, state government officials,
and US Senators and Members of the House of Representatives.
Many of these commenters, including investors with trillions of dollars of assets under
management collectively,
38 supported implementation of climate-related disclosure rules. A
number of commenters39 stated that mandated disclosures are necessary because climate change
poses significant financial risks to registrants and their investors.40
 According to one of the
commenters, 68 out of 77 industries are likely to be significantly affected by climate risk.41

Many commenters criticized the current disclosure practice, in which some issuers voluntarily
provide climate disclosures based on a variety of different third-party frameworks, because it has

Sustainability Group (June 4, 2021); and Trillium Asset Management (June 9, 2021).
40 Several commenters referred to various reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) to
demonstrate that there is scientific consensus that climate change is the result of global warming caused by
human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and poses significant global risks. See, e.g., letters from Better
Markets (June 14, 2021); Center for Human Rights and Environment (June 9, 2021); Commonwealth Climate
and Law Initiative (June 13, 2021); Charles E. Frye (Apr. 3, 2021); Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility (June 14, 2021); and Mike Levin and 23 other Members of Congress (June 15, 2021). IPCC’s
latest report is IPCC,AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis (Aug. 7, 2021), available at

not produced consistent, comparable, reliable information for investors and their advisors, who
otherwise have difficulty obtaining that information.
42
Other commenters, however, questioned whether climate change posed a risk to
companies or their investors. These commenters stated their belief that the assumptions
underlying the assessment of the impact of climate change were too uncertain to permit
companies to ascertain the real risks to their operations and financial condition caused by climate
change.43
 These commenters stated that they opposed implementation of climate-related
disclosure rules, and argued that such rules would exceed the Commission’s statutory authority.
Some of these commenters also argued that such rules are not necessary because registrants are
already required to disclose material climate risks, or that such rules would be more costly than
the current “private ordering” of climate disclosures.44
 Some commenters also argued that
mandated climate disclosure rules could violate First Amendment rights.

21
As noted above, we have considered these comments and other feedback received from
the public in formulating the current proposal. As part of its filing review process, the
Commission staff also assessed the extent to which registrants currently disclose climate-related
risks in their Commission filings. Since 2010, disclosures related to climate change have
generally increased, but there is considerable variation in the content, detail, and location (i.e., in
reports filed with the Commission, in sustainability reports posted on registrant websites, or
elsewhere) of climate-related disclosures. The staff has observed significant inconsistency in the
depth and specificity of disclosures by registrants across industries and within the same industry.
The staff has found significantly more extensive information in registrants’ sustainability reports
and other locations such as their websites as compared with their reports filed with the
Commission. In addition, the disclosures in registrants’ Forms 10-K frequently contain general,
boilerplate discussions that provide limited information as to the registrants’ assessment of their
climate-related risks or their impact on the companies’ business.46

We are also mindful of the benefits to investors of requiring climate-related information
in SEC filings. Providing more extensive climate-related disclosure in sustainability reports,
while excluding such relevant information from Forms 10-K, may make it difficult for investors
to analyze and compare how climate-related risks and impacts affect registrants’ businesses and
consolidated financial statements. The inclusion of climate-related disclosures in SEC filings
should increase the consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-related information for
investors. The placement of climate-related information in different locations can make it
difficult for investors to find comparable climate-related disclosures, whereas inclusion in a

improved disclosure on some of the deficient areas noted in their review of filings. See Climate Change
Disclosure-Sample Letter, available at https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/sample-letter-climate-change-disclosures.
22
registrant’s Form 10-K or registration statement should make it easier for investors to find and
compare this information.47
 Further, information that is filed with the Commission in Exchange
Act periodic reports is subject to disclosure controls and procedures (“DCP”), which help to
ensure that a registrant maintains appropriate processes for collecting and communicating the
necessary information by which to formulate the climate-related disclosures.48
 Moreover,
information filed as part of a registrant’s Form 10-K carries certain additional potential liability,
which itself can cause registrants to prepare and review information filed in the Form 10-K more
carefully than information presented outside SEC filings.49

Having considered the public feedback and the staff’s experience with climate-related
disclosures, we believe that the current disclosure system is not eliciting consistent, comparable,
and reliable information that enables investors both to assess accurately the potential impacts of
climate-related risks on the nature of a registrant’s business and to gauge how a registrant’s
board and management are assessing and addressing those impacts.
50
 The Commission has
broad authority to promulgate disclosure rules that are in the public interest or for the protection
47 See, e.g., letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
48 See 17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 17 CFR 240.15d-15.
49 We note that the liability provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act can apply to
statements made in filings with the SEC or elsewhere, such as in sustainability reports or on company websites.
See, e.g., SEC v. Stinson, No. 10-3130, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65723, 2011 WL 2462038, at 12 (E.D. Pa. June
20, 2011) (finding defendants liable under Section 10(b) when they communicated material misstatements and
omissions in direct solicitations via e-mail, a webinar, and various web sites). As such, registrants should
scrutinize and ensure the accuracy of such statements whether or not filed with the Commission. In addition,
information filed in a Form 10-K is subject to Section 18 of the Exchange Act. Further, information filed in an
annual report on Form 10-K (and other current and periodic reports) can be incorporated by reference in certain
Securities Act registration statements, such as those filed on Form S-3, and thereby become subject to the
liability provisions of the Securities Act. See Securities Act Section 11 (15 U.S.C. 77k) and Section 12 (15
U.S.C. 77l). See infra Section II.C.3-4, II.E, II.G.1, and II.I regarding the application to forward-looking
climate disclosures of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements that was added to the Securities Act and
Exchange Act pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
50 See supra note 42 and accompanying text.
23
of investors and that promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.51
 In light of the
present and growing significance of climate-related risks to registrants and the inadequacies of
current climate disclosures, we are proposing to revise our rules to include climate-related
disclosure items and metrics to elicit investment decision-useful information that is necessary or
appropriate to protect investors.
We also believe that enhanced climate disclosure requirements could increase confidence
in the capital markets and help promote efficient valuation of securities and capital formation by
requiring more consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure about climate-related risks,
including how those risks are likely to impact a registrant’s business operations and financial
performance.
52
 The proposed requirements may also result in benefits to registrants, given
existing costs to registrants that have resulted from the inconsistent market response to investor
demand for climate-related information.53
 In this regard our proposal would provide registrants
with a more standardized framework to communicate their assessments of climate-related risks
51 See letters from Jill E. Fisch and 18 other law professor signatories (June 11, 2021) (referencing Sections 7, 10,
and 19(a) of the Securities Act; and Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 14, 15(d), and 23(a) of the Exchange Act); and
Natural Resources Defense Council (June 11, 2021).
52 See letters from Eni SpA (June 12, 2021); Jill. E. Fisch et al; Natural Resources Defense Council; SASB; and
Value Balancing Alliance (June 28, 2021); see also infra Section IV.
53 See, e.g., letter from SASB (stating that through the “multiple voluntary disclosure frameworks (i.e., the
“alphabet soup” decried by companies)...and numerous direct requests to companies for information through
surveys, the current private ordering-led system has increased the burden on companies—and investors—while
still leaving many companies uncertain as to whether they are, in practice, providing the decision-useful
information required by investors.”); see also letters from Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and
Public Citizen (June 14, 2021) (stating that “the proliferation of differing frameworks has increased compliance
complexities and costs for companies”); Eni SpA (stating that the fragmentation of data fostered by the
proliferation of reporting frameworks has multiplied the efforts of companies in satisfying all their
requirements); and BSR (June 11, 2021) (providing that “a fragmented environment is limiting the impact of
reporting and creating undue confusion and cost on the part of reporters.”).
24
as well as the measures they are taking to address those risks.
54
 At the same time, we are open to
exploring ways in which registrants could be afforded flexibility in making the necessary
disclosures while still providing appropriate consistency and comparability, and are seeking
comment in that regard.
C. The Growing Investor Demand for Climate-Related Risk Disclosure and
Related Information
1. Major Investor Climate-Related Initiatives
As the Commission recognized in 2010 and earlier, there has been significant investor
demand for information about how climate conditions may impact their investments. That
demand has been increasing in recent years. Several major institutional investors, which
collectively have trillions of dollars in investments under management, have demanded climaterelated information from the companies in which they invest because of their assessment of
climate change as a risk to their portfolios, and to investments generally, and also to satisfy
investor interest in investments that are considered “sustainable.” As a result, these investors
have sought to include and consider climate risk as part of their investment selection process.55
These institutional investors have formed investor initiatives to collectively urge companies to
provide better information about the impact that climate change has had or is likely to have on
54 Providing a more standardized framework for climate-related disclosures would be consistent with the
Recommendation from the Investor-as-Owner Subcommittee of the SEC Investor Advisory Committee Relating
to ESG Disclosure (May 14, 2020) (“IAC Recommendation”), available at
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisory-committee-2012/recommendation-of-the-investor-as-ownersubcommittee-on-esg-disclosure.pdf. The term “ESG” refers to environmental, social, and governance matters,
of which climate-related disclosures is a part. The IAC Recommendation focused on the inadequacies of ESG
disclosures broadly, and not just on those involving climate. The IAC Recommendation stated that, to the
extent that SEC reporting obligations would require a single standard of material, decision-useful ESG
information, as relevant to each issuer, and based upon data that issuers already use to make their business
decisions, such an approach would level the playing field between well-financed large issuers and capital
constrained small issuers.
55 See supra note 23.
25
their businesses, and to urge governments and companies to take steps to reduce investors’
exposure to climate risks. Among these initiatives:
56
• In 2019, more than 630 investors collectively managing more than $37 trillion signed the
Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change urging governments to
require climate-related financial reporting;
57

• This investor initiative continued as the Investor Agenda’s 2021 Global Investor
Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis, which was signed by 733 global
institutional investors, including some of the largest investors, with more than US $52
trillion in assets under management in the aggregate. This Statement called for
governments to implement a number of measures, including mandating climate risk

exposure to those risks is consistent with the exercise of their fiduciary duties to their respective
clients.65
At the same time, many companies have made commitments with respect to climate
change, such as commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or become “net zero” by a
particular date.66
 Companies may make these commitments to attract investors, to appeal to
customers that prioritize sustainability, or to reduce their exposure to risks posed by an expected
transition to a lower carbon economy.67 In response to these commitments, investors have
demanded more detailed information about climate-related targets and companies’ plans to
achieve them in order to assess the credibility of those commitments and compare companies
based on those commitments.68
These initiatives demonstrate that investors are using information about climate risks now
as part of their investment selection process and are seeking more informative disclosures about
those risks. As an increasing number of investors incorporate this information, in particular

consider climate-related risks. See, e.g., letters from PRI (Consultation Response); and California Public

transition risks for companies that are seeking to raise capital.
2. Third-Party Data, Voluntary Disclosure Frameworks, and International
Disclosure Initiatives
Despite increasing investor demand for information about climate-related risks and
strategies, many investors maintain that they cannot obtain the consistent, comparable, and
material information that they need to properly inform their investment or voting decisions.69
 In
2020, the Commission’s Investor Advisory Committee (“IAC”) noted the fragmentation of
information that has resulted from a rise in third-party data providers that have emerged to try to
meet the informational demands of investors.
70
 The IAC recommended that the Commission
take action to ensure investors have the material, comparable, consistent information about
climate and other ESG matters that they need to make investment and voting decisions.
In addition, a diverse group of third parties has developed climate-related reporting
frameworks seeking to meet investors’ informational demands. These include the Global
69 See supra note 42.
70 See IAC Recommendation. The IAC Recommendation noted that more than 125 third-party ESG data
providers, including ESG ratings firms, have emerged to try to meet the informational demands of investors.
According to the IAC Recommendation, these data providers are limited in their ability collectively to provide
investors with comparable and consistent information as they use different information sources and different—
frequently opaque—methodologies to conduct their analyses, which compromises the usefulness and reliability
of the information. This current heterogeneity in practices and disparate demands from investors and ratings
firms places a significant burden on companies asked to provide this information in a variety of formats. The
IAC Recommendation further observed that many companies feel compelled to respond to the multiple surveys
of ESG rating firms because ignoring them or refusing to respond can lead to a low rating, which can adversely
affect stock price and access to capital. While the proposed rules would not necessarily eliminate third-party
questionnaires, they would help to provide standardized information to all investors and might reduce the need
to obtain the information obtained through questionnaires.
29
Reporting Initiative (“GRI”),
71 CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project),72 Climate
Disclosure Standards Board (“CDSB”),73 Value Reporting Foundation (formed through a merger
of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and the International Integrated
Reporting Council (“IIRC”)),74 and the TCFD.
75

To some extent, the development of these disparate frameworks has led to an increase in
the number of companies that are providing some climate-related disclosures.
76 However,
because they are voluntary, companies that choose to disclose under these frameworks may
provide partial disclosures or they may choose not to participate every year. In addition, the
form and content of the disclosures may vary significantly from company to company, or from
period to period for the same company. The situation resulting from these multiple voluntary
frameworks has failed to produce the consistent, comparable, and reliable information that
investors need.
77 Instead, the proliferation of third-party reporting frameworks has contributed to
reporting fragmentation, which can hinder investors’ ability to understand and compare
registrants’ climate-related disclosures. An analysis conducted by the World Business Council
71 See GRI, About GRI, available at https://www.globalreporting.org/about-gri/.
72 See CDP, About Us, available at https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us. In 2018, CDP revised its questionnaire
to companies so that it aligns with the TCFD recommended framework. See letter from CDP.

74 See Value Reporting Foundation, Understanding the Value Reporting Foundation, available at
https://www.valuereportingfoundation.org/.
75 See TCFD, About, available at https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/about/.
76 For example, according to the CDP, over 3,000 companies have provided climate-related disclosures through
the CDP’s platform by responding to the CDP’s questionnaires that are aligned with the TCFD’s disclosure
recommendations. See letter from CDP. The TCFD has similarly reported growth in the number of companies
and countries supporting its climate-related disclosure recommendations. See TCFD, 2021 Status Report (Oct.
2021), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Status_Report.pdf (stating
that, as of Oct. 6, 2021, the TCFD had over 2,600 supporters globally, including 1,069 financial institutions
responsible for assets of US $194 trillion).

for Sustainable Development found that investors had difficulty using existing sustainability
disclosures because they lack consistency and comparability.78
 In addition, a 2020 study by the
Yale Initiative on Sustainable Finance found that the proliferation of reporting frameworks may
have made reporting more difficult for issuers.79
 Moreover, given the voluntary nature of these
third-party frameworks, there may not be sufficient incentives or external disciplines to ensure
that companies are providing complete and robust disclosure under those frameworks.
80

The staff has reviewed more than a dozen studies of climate-related disclosures
conducted by third parties, such as the CDP,81 KPMG,82 TCFD83, and Ernst & Young,84 which
assessed the adherence of the climate-related disclosures to various third-party frameworks, such
as the TCFD. These studies have reinforced the staff’s observations from their review of filings
that there is significant variation across companies and industries with regard to the content of

current climate disclosures.
85
 Further, much of this climate-related information, particularly
GHG emissions and targets, appears outside of Commission filings, in sustainability reports, and
on corporate websites. Other analyses of current climate reporting have found a lack of
transparency and standardization with regard to the methodologies companies apply in disclosing
climate-related information.86
The increased fragmentation of climate reporting resulting from the proliferation of thirdparty reporting frameworks has motivated a number of recent international efforts to obtain more
consistent, comparable, and reliable climate-related information for investors. For example:
• A consultation paper published by the IFRS Foundation87 Trustees in 2020 noted the
broad range of voluntary sustainability reporting frameworks that have increased
85
 For example, the TCFD report found that the average level of disclosure across the TCFD’s 11 disclosure
categories was 40% for the energy sector, 30% for the materials and building sector, 18% for the consumer
goods sector and 13% for the technology sector. The level of disclosure varied among categories with only 4%
or reporting companies disclosing the resilience of their strategies in North America and 50% reporting their
risks and opportunities (the category with the highest level of disclosure). The Ernst & Young report found
many companies in industries considered to have high exposure to climate-related risks lack high quality
climate disclosures. The Ernst & Young report graded the average quality of the disclosures at 27 out of 100.
86
 See, e.g., The SEC’s Time to Act, Center for American Progress (Feb. 19, 2021) (“[T]here is a lack of
standardization of the data, assumptions, and methodologies companies use to meet the standards, with much of
this information being opaque. Clearly, the current path of climate disclosure will not provide the transparency
that an increasing number of investors are seeking and, indeed, a properly functioning market requires—
consistency of disclosures across time, comparability of disclosures across companies, and reliability of the
information that is disclosed.”) See, also, Andy Green and Andrew Schwartz, Corporate Long-Termism,
Transparency, and the Public Interest (Oct. 2, 2018) (“[C]orporate disclosure available today is insufficient, not
comparable, and unreliable”); and Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System, Report of the ClimateRelated Market Risk Subcommittee, Market Risk Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (2020) (“Large companies are increasingly disclosing some climate-related information, but
significant variations remain in the information disclosed by each company, making it difficult for investors and
others to understand exposure and manage climate risks.”).
87 The IFRS Foundation refers to the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which was
established to develop a single set of “high-quality,” enforceable, and globally accepted accounting standards.

• Based on the response to the IFRS Foundation consultation paper, the IFRS Foundation
took steps toward the establishment of an International Sustainability Standards Board
(“ISSB”) operating within the existing governance structure of the IFRS Foundation;
• In 2021, following two roundtables hosted by its Sustainable Finance Task Force,
IOSCO89 issued a report that concluded that companies’ current sustainability disclosures
do not meet investors’ needs, and the proliferation of voluntary disclosure frameworks
has led to inconsistency in application of the frameworks and, in some cases “cherry
picking” of information that might not present an accurate picture of companies’ risks.90

and data tagging to facilitate the use of the information.95
These international developments show an increasing global recognition of the need to
improve companies’ climate-related disclosures, which the proposed rules would help address, as
well as the convergence of investors and issuers around the TCFD as a useful framework for
communicating information about climate-related risks that companies may face.

may mean that investors are unable to take sufficient account of climate-related risks in their investment
decisions.

D. Development of a Climate-Related Reporting Framework
In recent years, two significant developments have occurred that support and inform the
Commission’s proposed climate-related reporting rules. The first involves the TCFD, which has
developed a climate-related reporting framework that has become widely accepted by both
registrants and investors.96
 The second involves the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG
Protocol”), which has become a leading accounting and reporting standard for greenhouse gas
emissions.
97 Both the TCFD and the GHG Protocol have developed concepts and a vocabulary
that are commonly used by companies when providing climate-related disclosures in their
sustainability or related reports. As discussed in greater detail below, the Commission’s
proposed rules incorporate some of these concepts and vocabulary, which by now are familiar to
many registrants and investors.
1. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure
Our proposed climate-related disclosure framework is modeled in part on the TCFD’s
recommendations. A goal of the proposed rules is to elicit climate-related disclosures that are
consistent, comparable, and reliable while also attempting to limit the compliance burden
associated with these disclosures. The TCFD framework has been widely accepted by issuers,
96 A number of registrants recommended basing the Commission’s climate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD
framework. See, e.g., letters from Adobe; Alphabet Inc. et al.; BNP Paribas (June 11, 2021); bp; Chevron (June
11, 2021; ConocoPhilips; and Walmart. Similarly, numerous investors and investor groups recommended the
TCFD framework. See letters from Alberta Investment Management Corporation; BlackRock; CalPERS;
CALSTRS (June 4, 2021); Impact Investors, Inc.; and San Francisco Employees Retirement System. See also
infra Section II.A.1 for further discussion of the many commenters that recommended basing the Commission’s
climate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD framework.
97 See, e.g., letter from Natural Resources Defense Council (stating that most companies providing climate-related
information do so using the three-part (scope) framework developed by the GHG Protocol and noting other
organizations, such as the CDP, that use the GHG Protocol’s framework and methodology); see also GHG
Protocol, Companies and Organizations, available at https://ghgprotocol.org/companies-and-organizations
(stating that 92% of companies responding to the CDP in 2016 used the GHG Protocol’s standards and
guidance).
35
investors, and other market participants, and, accordingly, we believe that proposing rules based
on the TCFD framework may facilitate achieving this balance between eliciting better disclosure
and limiting compliance costs.
98
In April 2015, the Group of 20 Finance Ministers directed the Financial Stability Board
(“FSB”) to evaluate ways in which the financial sector could address climate-related concerns.99
The FSB concluded that better information was needed to facilitate informed investment
decisions and to help investors and other market participants to better understand and take into
account climate-related risks. The FSB established the TCFD, an industry-led task force charged
with promoting better-informed investment, credit, and insurance underwriting decisions.
100

Since then, the framework for climate-related disclosures developed by the TCFD has been
refined and garnered global support as a reliable framework for climate-related financial
reporting.101

In 2017, the TCFD published disclosure recommendations that provide a framework by
which to evaluate material climate-related risks and opportunities through an assessment of their
projected short-, medium-, and long-term financial impacts on a registrant. The TCFD
framework establishes eleven disclosure topics related to four core themes that provide a
98 See infra Section II.A.1 and notes 145 through 149.
99 See TCFD, 2020 Status Report (Oct. 2020). The Group of 20 (“G20”) is a group of finance ministers and
central bank governors from 19 countries, including the United States, plus the European Union, which was
formed in 1999 to promote global economic growth, international trade, and regulation of financial markets.
According to the G20, its members represent more than 80% of world GDP, 75% of international trade, and
60% of the world population. See G20, About the G20, available at https://g20.org/about-the-g20/.

has aligned its questionnaires to elicit disclosures aligned with the TCFD’s recommendations).

structure for the assessment, management, and disclosure of climate-related financial risks:
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.102
Support for the TCFD’s recommendations by companies and other reporting frameworks
has grown steadily since the TCFD’s formation.
103 As of October 2021 more than 2,600
organizations globally, with a total market capitalization of $25 trillion have expressed support
for the TCFD.104
 Further, 1,069 financial institutions, managing assets of $194 trillion, also
support the TCFD.
105
 In recognition of the widespread adoption by companies of TCFD
reporting, a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Switzerland,
and the European Union that have proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure requirements
have indicated an intention to base disclosure requirements on the TCFD framework.
106
 Further,
the TCFD’s recommendations have been adopted by, and incorporated into, other voluntary
climate disclosure frameworks such as the CDP, GRI, CDSB, and SASB frameworks. The
TCFD also forms the framework for the Prototype that the IFRS Foundation provided to the

of the TCFD recommendations.” https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/support-tcfd/
104 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report. A recent survey by Moody’s of over 3,800 companies worldwide indicated that
the global average disclosure rate of companies that reported across all 11 TCFD’s recommendations increased
to 22% in 2021 from 16% in 2020. See Moody’s State of TCFD Disclosures 2021, available at

20Disclosures%202021.pdf. In addition, according to a recent report by the Governance & Accountability
Institute, Inc., 70% of companies in the Russell 1000 Index published sustainability reports in 2020, and of
those reporters, 30% mentioned or aligned their disclosures with the TCFD framework, and 40% responded to
the CDP questionnaires, which are aligned with the TCFD. See Governance & Accountability Institute,

ISSB as a potential starting point for its standard setting initiative.
107
 The G7 Finance Ministers
and Central Bank Governors have also endorsed the TCFD.108 As a result, although the
reporting landscape is crowded with voluntary standards that seek different information in
different formats, the TCFD framework has been widely endorsed by U.S. companies and
regulators and standard-setters around the world.
2. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol
Quantitative greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions data can enable investors to assess a
registrant’s exposure to climate-related risks, including regulatory, technological, and market
risks driven by a transition to a lower-GHG intensive economy.
109
 This data also could help
investors to assess the progress of registrants with public commitments to reduce GHG
emissions, which would be important in assessing potential future capital outlays that might be
required to meet such commitments. For these reasons, many investors and other commenters
recommended that we require disclosure of a registrant’s GHG emissions.110
 Many commenters
also recommended that we base any GHG emissions disclosure requirement on the GHG

Protocol.
111
 These commenters indicated that the GHG Protocol has become the most widelyused global greenhouse gas accounting standard.112 For example, the Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) Center for Corporate Climate Leadership references the GHG Protocol’s
standards and guidance as resources for companies that seek to calculate their GHG emissions.
113
The GHG Protocol was created through a partnership between the World Resources
Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which agreed in 1997 to
collaborate with businesses and NGOs to create a standardized GHG accounting methodology.114
The GHG Protocol has been updated periodically since its original publication and has been
broadly incorporated into sustainability reporting frameworks, including the TCFD, Value
Reporting Foundation, GRI, CDP, CDSB, and the IFRS Foundation’s Prototype.
The GHG Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard provides uniform
methods to measure and report the seven greenhouse gasses covered by the Kyoto Protocol –
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur

hexafluoride, and nitrogen trifluoride.115
 The GHG Protocol introduced the concept of “scopes”
of emissions to help delineate those emissions that are directly attributable to the reporting entity
and those that are indirectly attributable to the company’s activities.116
 Under the GHG Protocol,
Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the
company. These might include emissions from company-owned or controlled machinery or
vehicles, or methane emissions from petroleum operations. Scope 2 emissions are those
emissions primarily resulting from the generation of electricity purchased and consumed by the
company.117
 Because these emissions derive from the activities of another party (the power
provider), they are considered indirect emissions. Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect
emissions not accounted for in Scope 2 emissions. These emissions are a consequence of the
company’s activities but are generated from sources that are neither owned nor controlled by the
company.118
 These might include emissions associated with the production and transportation of

Climate Change by obtaining commitments from industrialized countries to reduce emissions of the seven
identified gasses according to agreed targets. See United Nations Climate Change, What is the Kyoto
Protocol?, available at https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol. The EPA includes these seven greenhouse gases in its
greenhouse gas reporting program. See, e.g., EPA, GHGRP Emissions by GHG, available at

118 The Scope 3 emissions standard was developed over a three-year period with participation by businesses,
government agencies, academics, and NGOs to help companies understand and manage their climate-related
risks and opportunities in their upstream and downstream value chains. See Greenhouse Gas Protocol,
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, Supplement to the GHG Protocol
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Sept. 2011), available at
https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Corporate-Value-Chain-Accounting-ReporingStandard_041613_2.pdf. This standard identified eight upstream and seven downstream emission categories
that can give rise to Scope 3 emissions. The GHG Protocol is developing additional guidance that may impact
Scope 3 emissions related to land use and land sector activities. See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Update on

goods a registrant purchases from third parties, employee commuting or business travel, and the
processing or use of the registrant’s products by third parties.119
We have based our proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement primarily on the
GHG Protocol’s concept of scopes and related methodology.
120
 By basing this requirement on
an established GHG emissions reporting framework, we believe the compliance burden would be
mitigated, especially for those registrants that are already disclosing or estimating their GHG
emissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol.
E. Summary of the Proposed Rules
We are proposing to add a new subpart to Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.1500-1507
(“Subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K”) that would require a registrant to disclose certain climaterelated information, including information about its climate-related risks that are reasonably
likely to have material impacts on its business or consolidated financial statements, and GHG
emissions metrics that could help investors assess those risks.
121
 A registrant may also include
disclosure about its climate-related opportunities. The proposed new subpart to Regulation S-K
119
 See Section II.G.1, below, for a more extensive discussion of Scope 3 categories and emissions.
120 See id.
121 See infra Sections II.B through E and II.G through I.
41
would include an attestation requirement for accelerated filers122 and large accelerated filers123
regarding certain proposed GHG emissions metrics disclosures.
124
We are also proposing to add a new article to Regulation S-X, 17 CFR 210.14-01 and 02
(“Article 14 of Regulation S-X”) that would require certain climate-related financial statement
metrics and related disclosure to be included in a note to a registrant’s audited financial
statements.125
 The proposed financial statement metrics would consist of disaggregated climaterelated impacts on existing financial statement line items. As part of the registrant’s financial
statements, the financial statement metrics would be subject to audit by an independent
registered public accounting firm, and come within the scope of the registrant’s internal control
over financial reporting (“ICFR”).
126
1. Content of the Proposed Disclosures
The proposed climate-related disclosure framework is modeled in part on the TCFD’s
recommendations, and also draws upon the GHG Protocol. In particular, the proposed rules
would require a registrant to disclose information about:
122 See 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (defining “accelerated filer” as an issuer after it first meets the following conditions as of
the end of its fiscal year: (i) the issuer had an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting
common equity held by its non-affiliates of $75 million or more, but less than $700 million, as of the last
business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter; (ii) the issuer has been subject to the
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; (iii)
the issuer has filed at least one annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and (iv)
the issuer is not eligible to use the requirements for SRCs under the SRC revenue test).
123 See 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (defining “large accelerated filer” as an issuer after it first meets the following
conditions as of the end of its fiscal year: (i) the issuer had an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting
and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more, as of the last business day of
the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter; (ii) the issuer has been subject to the requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; (iii) the issuer has
filed at least one annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and (iv) the issuer is not
eligible to use the requirements for SRCs under the SRC revenue test).
124 See infra Section II.H.
125 See infra Section II.F.
126 See infra Sections II.F.2 and 3.
42
• The oversight and governance of climate-related risks by the registrant’s board and
management;
127
• How any climate-related risks identified by the registrant have had or are likely to have a
material impact on its business and consolidated financial statements, which may
manifest over the short-, medium-, or long-term;128
• How any identified climate-related risks have affected or are likely to affect the
registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook;129

• The registrant’s processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks
and whether any such processes are integrated into the registrant’s overall risk
management system or processes;130
• The impact of climate-related events (severe weather events and other natural conditions
as well as physical risks identified by the registrant) and transition activities (including
transition risks identified by the registrant) on the line items of a registrant’s consolidated
financial statements and related expenditures,
131 and disclosure of financial estimates and
assumptions impacted by such climate-related events and transition activities.
132
• Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions metrics, separately disclosed, expressed:
o Both by disaggregated constituent greenhouse gases and in the aggregate, and
127 See infra Section II.D.
128 See infra Sections II.B and C.
129 See infra Section II.C.
130 See infra Section II.E.
131 See infra Sections II.F.2 and 3.
132 See infra Sections II.F.4.
43
o In absolute and intensity terms;133
• Scope 3 GHG emissions and intensity, if material, or if the registrant has set a GHG
emissions reduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions; and
• The registrant’s climate-related targets or goals, and transition plan, if any.134
When responding to any of the proposed rules’ provisions concerning governance,
strategy, and risk management, a registrant may also disclose information concerning any
identified climate-related opportunities.
2. Presentation of the Proposed Disclosures
The proposed rules would require a registrant (both domestic and foreign private
issuers
135):
• To provide the climate-related disclosure in its registration statements and Exchange Act
annual reports;
136
• To provide the Regulation S-K mandated climate-related disclosure in a separate,
appropriately captioned section of its registration statement or annual report, or
alternatively to incorporate that information in the separate, appropriately captioned
133 See infra Section II.G.1.
134 See infra Section II.I.
135 As defined by Commission rules, a foreign private issuer is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government
except an issuer meeting the following conditions as of the last business day of its most recently completed
second fiscal quarter: more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer are directly or indirectly
owned of record by residents of the United States; and either the majority of its executive officers or directors
are United States citizens or residents, more than 50% of the assets of the issuer are located in the United States,
or the business of the issuer is administered principally in the United States. See 17 CFR 230.405 and 17 CFR
240.3b-4.
136 See infra Section II.A.2.
44
section by reference from another section, such as Risk Factors, Description of Business,
or Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”);137
• To provide the Regulation S-X mandated climate-related financial statement metrics and
related disclosure in a note to the registrant’s audited financial statements;
138
• To electronically tag both narrative and quantitative climate-related disclosures in Inline
XBRL;
139 and
• To file rather than furnish the climate-related disclosure.140
3. Attestation for Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions Disclosure
The proposed rules would require an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer to
include, in the relevant filing, an attestation report covering, at a minimum, the disclosure of its
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and to provide certain related disclosures about the service
provider.141
 As proposed, both accelerated filers and large accelerated filers would have time to
transition to the minimum attestation requirements. The proposed transition periods would
provide existing accelerated filers and large accelerated filers one fiscal year to transition to
providing limited assurance and two additional fiscal years to transition to providing reasonable
assurance, starting with the respective compliance dates for Scopes 1 and 2 disclosure described
below.
142
 The proposed rules would provide minimum attestation report requirements, minimum
standards for acceptable attestation frameworks, and would require an attestation service
137 See id.
138 See infra Section II.F.
139 See infra Section II.K.
140 See infra Section II.L.
141 See infra Section II.H.

requirements).
45
provider to meet certain minimum qualifications. The proposed rules would not require an
attestation service provider to be a registered public accounting firm.
4. Phase-In Periods and Accommodations for the Proposed Disclosures
The proposed rules would include:
• A phase-in for all registrants, with the compliance date dependent on the registrant’s filer
status;
• An additional phase-in period for Scope 3 emissions disclosure;
• A safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure;
• An exemption from the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement for a registrant meeting
the definition of a smaller reporting company (“SRC”);
143 and
• A provision permitting a registrant, if actual reported data is not reasonably available, to
use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter, together with
actual, determined GHG emissions data for the first three fiscal quarters, as long as the
registrant promptly discloses in a subsequent filing any material difference between the
estimate used and the actual, determined GHG emissions data for the fourth fiscal
quarter.
The proposed rules would be phased in for all registrants, with the compliance date
dependent upon the status of the registrant as a large accelerated filer, accelerated or nonaccelerated filer, or SRC, and the content of the item of disclosure. For example, assuming that
the effective date of the proposed rules occurs in December 2022 and that the registrant has a
143 See infra Section II.G.3. The Commission’s rules define a smaller reporting company to mean an issuer that is
not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a
smaller reporting company and that: (1) had a public float of less than $250 million; or (2) had annual revenues
of less than $100 million and either: (i) no public float; or (ii) a public float of less than $700 million. See 17
CFR 229.10(f)(1), 230.405, and 17 CFR 240.12b-2.
46
December 31st fiscal year-end, the compliance date for the proposed disclosures in annual
reports, other than the Scope 3 disclosure, would be:
• For large accelerated filers, fiscal year 2023 (filed in 2024);
• For accelerated and non-accelerated filers, fiscal year 2024 (filed in 2025); and
• For SRCs, fiscal year 2025 (filed in 2026).
144
Registrants subject to the proposed Scope 3 disclosure requirements would have one
additional year to comply with those disclosure requirements.
We welcome feedback and encourage interested parties to submit comments on any or all
aspects of the proposed rules. When commenting, it would be most helpful if you include the
reasoning behind your position or recommendation.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Overview of the Climate-Related Disclosure Framework
1. Proposed TCFD-Based Disclosure Framework
We have modeled the proposed disclosure rules in part on the TCFD disclosure
framework. Building on the TCFD framework should enable companies to leverage the
framework with which many investors and issuers are already familiar, which should help to
mitigate both the compliance burden for issuers and any burdens faced by investors in analyzing
and comparing the new proposed disclosures.
Many commenters that supported climate disclosure rules recommended that we consider
the TCFD framework in developing those rules. Numerous commenters stated that the
Commission should base its climate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD framework either as a
144 See infra Section II.M.

issuers148 and investors,
149 supported basing new climate-related disclosure rules on the TCFD
framework.
Commenters provided several reasons for their support of the TCFD framework. First,
commenters indicated that, because of the widespread adoption of the framework, issuers and
investors have experience making and using TCFD disclosures. As a result, according to
commenters, aligning SEC rules with the TCFD could reduce the burden on issuers and increase
the consistency and comparability of climate disclosures.150
 Second, commenters stated that the
information that the TCFD disclosures elicit is useful for investors to understand companies’
exposure to and management of climate-related risks.151
 Third, various jurisdictions around the
world have announced their intention to align their domestic disclosure rules with the TCFD.152

Commenters stated that by aligning with the TCFD framework, the Commission could
potentially facilitate higher levels of consistency and comparability of disclosures globally.153
The consistency and breadth of these comments comport with our understanding that the
TCFD framework has been widely accepted by issuers, investors, and other market participants
and reinforce our view that the framework would provide an appropriate foundation for the

proposed amendments.
154
 Basing the Commission’s climate-related disclosure rules on a
globally recognized framework should help elicit climate-related disclosures that are consistent,
comparable, and reliable while also limiting the compliance burden for registrants that are
already providing climate-related disclosures based on this framework.
Similar to the TCFD framework, the proposed climate-related provisions under
Regulation S-K would require disclosure of a registrant’s: governance of climate-related risks;155
any material climate-related impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook;156 climaterelated risk management;
157 GHG emissions metrics;
158 and climate-related targets and goals, if
any.159

The proposed climate-related provisions under Regulation S-X would require a registrant
to disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated climate-related financial
statement metrics that are mainly derived from existing financial statement line items.160
 The
proposed rules would require disclosure falling under the following three categories of
154 Proponents of the TCFD framework include academics (see, e.g., letters from Jill Fisch et al., J. Robert Gibson

information: financial impact metrics;161 expenditure metrics;162 and financial estimates and
assumptions.163
 Similar to the TCFD’s recommendation regarding financial impacts, the
proposed financial statement metrics have the objective of increasing transparency about how
climate-related risks impact a registrant’s financial statements.164 The TCFD framework
identifies two broad categories of actual and potential financial impacts driven by climate-related
risks and opportunities: financial performance (income statement focused) and financial position
(balance sheet focused), and includes suggested metrics such as the amount of capital
expenditure deployed toward climate-related risks and opportunities, which is similar to our
proposed financial statement metrics.

2. Location of the Climate-Related Disclosure
Many commenters stated that the Commission should amend Regulation S-K or
Regulation S-X to include climate-related disclosure requirements.166

available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf. For
avoidance of doubt, disclosure of climate-related opportunities is optional, not required, under our proposal.

recommended that the Commission adopt a new stand-alone regulation for climate-related
disclosure.167
 We are proposing to include the climate-related disclosure rules in Regulation S-K
and Regulation S-X because the required disclosure is fundamental to investors’ understanding
the nature of a registrant’s business and its operating prospects and financial performance, and
therefore, should be presented together with other disclosure about the registrant’s business and
its financial condition.
Specifically, we are proposing to require a registrant to include climate-related disclosure
in Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statements and Exchange Act annual reports in a
separately captioned “Climate-Related Disclosure” section and in the financial statements.168

Requiring climate-related disclosure to be presented in this manner would facilitate review of the
climate-related disclosure by investors alongside other relevant company financial and nonfinancial information.
A registrant would be able to incorporate by reference disclosure from other parts of the
registration statement or annual report (e.g., Risk Factors, MD&A, or the financial statements)
or, in most cases, from other filed or submitted reports into the Climate-Related Disclosure item
if it is responsive to the topics specified in Items 1500-1506 of Regulation S-K and if the
registrant satisfies the incorporation by reference requirements under the Commission’s rules and
forms.
169 Allowing incorporation by reference for the Regulation S-K climate-related disclosure
167 See letters from Bank Policy Institute; Andrew Behar (As You Sow) (June 14, 2021); Entelligent Inc. (June 14,
2021); Impax Asset Management; Information Technology Industry Council; Majedie Asset Management (May

169 See 17 CFR 230.411; 17 CFR 240.12b-23; and the applicable forms.
52
would be consistent with the treatment of other types of business disclosure under our rules and
would provide some flexibility for registrants while reducing redundancy in disclosure.170
Many commenters stated that the Commission should require registrants to discuss and
analyze their quantitative climate data in a manner similar to that required for MD&A.171
 These
commenters stressed the importance of placing climate-related metrics in the context of other
company financial and non-financial information to enable investors to see how those metrics
intersect with business operations and industrial processes.172
 Other commenters supported a
requirement to discuss and analyze the climate-related metrics, but stated that such discussion
should be part of the existing MD&A disclosures.
173
 We agree with the commenters supporting
a narrative discussion and analysis of the climate-related metrics as means to present these
disclosures in context and explain how they relate to the registrant’s strategy and management of
its climate-related risks. In this way, such a discussion will serve a similar function to the
MD&A but will focus on climate-related risk specifically. Our proposed approach, which
170 A registrant that elects to incorporate by reference any of the metrics or narrative disclosure that is subject to
XBRL tagging must comply with the electronic tagging requirement in the section of the registration statement
or report where the metrics or narrative disclosure appears in full. We discuss the XBRL tagging requirement
in Section II.K.

results and stating that it would be difficult to enforce); and David Marriage (indicating that a discussion and
analysis requirement for climate-related data would make the data difficult for the market to absorb).
53
requires the climate-related disclosure to be included in a specific section but allows registrants
to incorporate from disclosure elsewhere (consistent with applicable incorporation by reference
requirements), provides some flexibility to the proposed climate-related disclosure scheme while
ensuring the disclosure is consistent and comparable across registrants.
Request for Comment
1. Should we add a new subpart to Regulation S-K and a new article to Regulation S-X that
would require a registrant to disclose certain climate-related information, as proposed? Would
including the climate-related disclosure in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X facilitate the
presentation of climate information as part of a registrant’s regular business reporting? Should
we instead place the climate-related disclosure requirements in a new regulation or report? Are
there certain proposed provisions, such as GHG emissions disclosure requirements, that would
be more appropriate under Regulation S-X than Regulation S-K?
2. If adopted, how will investors utilize the disclosures contemplated in this release to assess
climate-related risks? How will investors use the information to assess the physical effects and
related financial impacts from climate-related events? How will investors use the information to
assess risks associated with a transition to a lower carbon economy?
3. Should we model the Commission’s climate-related disclosure framework in part on the
framework recommended by the TCFD, as proposed? Would alignment with the TCFD help
elicit climate-related disclosures that are consistent, comparable, and reliable for investors?
Would alignment with the TCFD framework help mitigate the reporting burden for issuers and
facilitate understanding of climate-related information by investors because the framework is
widely used by companies in the United States and around the world? Are there aspects of the
TCFD framework that we should not adopt? Should we instead adopt rules that are based on a
54
different third-party framework? If so, which framework? Should we base the rules on
something other than an existing third-party framework?
4. Do our current reporting requirements yield adequate and sufficient information regarding
climate-related risks to allow investors to make informed decisions? In lieu of, or in addition to
the proposed amendments, should we provide updated guidance on how our existing rules may
elicit better disclosure about climate-related risks?
5. Should we require a registrant to present the climate-related disclosure in an appropriately
captioned, separate part of the registration statement or annual report, as proposed? Should this
disclosure instead be presented as part of the registrant’s MD&A?
6. Should we permit a registrant to incorporate by reference some of the climate-related
disclosure from other parts of the registration statement or annual report, as proposed? Should
we permit a registrant to incorporate by reference climate-related disclosure that appears in a
sustainability report if the registrant includes the incorporated by referenced disclosure as an
exhibit to the registration statement or annual report? Are there some climate-related disclosure
items, such as GHG emissions data, that we should not permit a registrant to incorporate by
reference? Would requiring a registrant to include all of the proposed climate-related disclosures
in a separate, appropriately captioned section, while precluding a registrant from incorporating
by reference some or all of the climate-related disclosures, promote comparability and ease of
use of the climate-related information for investors?
7. Should we permit a registrant to provide certain of the proposed climate-related
disclosures in Commission filings other than the annual report or registration statement? For
example, should we permit a registrant to provide information about board and management
oversight of climate-related risks in its proxy statement?
55
B. Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks
As many commenters have noted when seeking more detailed climate-related
disclosures,
174 climate events and contingencies can pose financial risks to issuers across
industrial sectors.
175
 Physical risks may include harm to businesses and their assets arising from
acute climate-related disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and heatwaves.
Companies and their investors may also face chronic risks and more gradual impacts from longterm temperature increases, drought, and sea level rise.
In addition to the physical risks associated with the climate, issuers and investors may
also face risks associated with a potential transition to a less carbon intensive economy. These
risks may arise from potential adoption of climate-related regulatory policies including those that
may be necessary to achieve the national climate goals that may be or have been adopted in the
United States and other countries;
176 climate-related litigation; changing consumer, investor, and
employee behavior and choices; changing demands of business partners; long-term shifts in
market prices; technological challenges and opportunities, and other transitional impacts.
174 See supra note 40.
175 The 2020 CFTC Advisory Subcommittee Report found that climate change currently impacts or is expected to
affect every part of the U.S. economy, including agriculture, real estate, infrastructure, and the financial sectors.
See infra note 361.
176 A National Climate Taskforce created by the president established commitments to reduce economy-wide net
greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels, and to reach net zero emissions by
2050. See The White House, FACT SHEET: President Biden Sets 2030 Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction
Target Aimed at Creating Good-Paying Union Jobs and Securing U.S. Leadership on Clean
Energy Technologies (Apr. 22, 2021). An Executive Order also directs the Federal government to achieve netzero emissions from overall Federal operations by 2050, and a 65% emissions reduction by 2030. See The
White House, FACT SHEET: President Biden Signs Executive Order Catalyzing America’s Clean Energy
Economy Through Federal Sustainability (Dec. 8, 2021), at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefingroom/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americasclean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/. A growing number of governments and companies have
made net zero commitments or announced similar carbon-reduction goals or targets. See United Nations
Climate Change, Commitments to Net Zero Double in Less Than a Year (Sept. 21, 2020), available at
https://unfccc.int/news/commitments-to-net-zero-double-in-less-than-a-year.
56
Disclosure about a registrant’s exposure to transition risks, as well as how the registrant is
assessing and managing those risks, would help investors assess and plan for how the registrant
would be financially impacted by a transition to a lower-carbon economy.
1. Definitions of Climate-Related Risks and Climate-Related Opportunities
A central focus of the Commission’s proposed rules is the identification and disclosure of
a registrant’s material climate-related risks. The proposed rules would require a registrant to
disclose any climate-related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant’s
business or consolidated financial statements.177
 A registrant may also disclose, as applicable,
the actual and potential impacts of any climate-related opportunities it is pursuing.178 The
proposed definitions are substantially similar to the TCFD’s definitions of climate-related risks
and climate-related opportunities.179
 We have based our definitions on the TCFD’s definitions
because they provide a common terminology that allows registrants to disclose climate-related
risks and opportunities in a consistent and comparable way. Grounding our definitions in a
framework that is already widely accepted also could help limit the burden on issuers to identify
and describe climate-related risks and improve the comparability and usefulness of the
disclosures for investors.
As proposed, “climate-related risks” means the actual or potential negative impacts of
climate-related conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements,
177 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a).
178 See id.
179 See TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Appendix 5.
57
business operations, or value chains, as a whole.
180
 “Value chain” would mean the upstream and
downstream activities related to a registrant’s operations.181 Under the proposed definition,
upstream activities include activities by a party other than the registrant that relate to the initial
stages of a registrant’s production of a good or service (e.g., materials sourcing, materials
processing, and supplier activities). Downstream activities would be defined to include activities
by a party other than the registrant that relate to processing materials into a finished product and
delivering it or providing a service to the end user (e.g., transportation and distribution,
processing of sold products, use of sold products, end of life treatment of sold products, and
investments).182
 We have proposed including a registrant’s value chain within the definition of
climate-related risks to capture the full extent of a registrant’s potential exposure to climaterelated risks, which can extend beyond its own operations to those of its suppliers, distributors,
and others engaged in upstream or downstream activities.183

Climate-related conditions and events can present risks related to the physical impacts of
the climate (“physical risks”) and risks related to a potential transition to a lower carbon
economy (“transition risks”). As proposed, “physical risks” is defined to include both acute and
chronic risks to a registrant’s business operations or the operations of those with whom it does
business.
184
 “Acute risks” is defined as event-driven risks related to shorter-term extreme
180 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c). The reference to ‘negative’ impact is intended to refer to the actual or
potential impact on the registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains as a
whole, rather than the mathematical impacts on a specific financial statement line item. See infra Section II.F.2
(discussing the proposed financial impact metrics, which focus on the line items in a registrant’s consolidated
financial statements).
181 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(t).
182 See id.
183 See, e.g., infra Section II.G.1.
184 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(1).
58
weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.185
 “Chronic risks” is defined as those
risks that the business may face as a result of longer term weather patterns and related effects,
such as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, drought, and increased wildfires, as well as
related effects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased habitability of land, and
decreased availability of fresh water.
186 Many of these physical risks have already impacted and
may continue to impact registrants across a wide range of economic sectors.
187

The proposed rules would define transition risks to mean the actual or potential negative
impacts on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains
attributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or
adaptation to, climate-related risks.
188 Transition risks would include, but are not limited to,
increased costs attributable to climate-related changes in law or policy, reduced market demand
for carbon-intensive products leading to decreased sales, prices, or profits for such products, the
devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs,
competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts
(including those stemming from a registrant’s customers or business counterparties) that might
trigger changes to market behavior, changes in consumer preferences or behavior, or changes in
a registrant’s behavior. A registrant that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has made
185 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(2).
186 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(3). The physical risks described are examples, but registrants may be
exposed to many other types of physical risks from climate change depending on their specific facts and
circumstances. As such, any reference to certain types of risks should be considered as non-exhaustive
examples.
187 The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report noted drought, heatwaves, hurricanes, and heavy precipitation. See IPCC,
Climate Change 2021, The Physical Science Basis Summary for Policymakers.
188 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c)(4).
59
a GHG emissions reduction commitment would likely be exposed to transition risks related to
the implementation of the commitment.189

The proposed rules would require a registrant to specify whether an identified climaterelated risk is a physical or transition risk so that investors can better understand the nature of the
risk190 and the registrant’s actions or plan to mitigate or adapt to the risk.
191
 If a physical risk,
the proposed rules would require a registrant to describe the nature of the risk, including whether
it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk.192

The proposed rules would require a registrant to include in its description of an identified
physical risk the location of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical
risk.193
 The proposed location disclosure would only be required for a physical risk that a
registrant has determined has had or is likely to have a material impact on its business or
consolidated financial statements. In such instances, a registrant would be required to provide
the ZIP code for the location or, if the location is in a jurisdiction that does not use ZIP codes, a
similar subnational postal zone or geographic location.194
 Because physical risks can be
concentrated in particular geographic areas, the proposed disclosure would allow investors to
better assess the risk exposure of one or more registrants with properties or operations in a
particular area. One commenter cited location information as a key component of how it, as an
189 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(ii).
190 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1).
191 See, e.g., proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(1) and 229.1503(c)(1) and (2).
192 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i). In some instances, chronic risks might give rise to acute risks. For
example, drought (a chronic risk) that increases acute risks, such as wildfires, or increased temperatures (a
chronic risk) that increases acute risks, such as severe storms. In such instances, a registrant should provide a
clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk.
193 See id.
194 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(k).
60
investor, assesses the climate risk facing a company, particularly for companies with fixed assets
that may be disproportionately exposed to climate-related physical risks.195
 Several other
commenters recommended that we require the disclosure of certain climate data to be
disaggregated by location using a point source’s zip code for risk assessment.196
 Disclosing the
zip codes of its identified material climate-related risks, rather than a broader location
designation, could help investors more accurately assess a registrant’s specific risk exposure.
Some registrants might be exposed to water-related acute physical risks, such as flooding,
which could impair a registrant’s operations or devalue its property. If flooding presents a
material physical risk, the proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose the percentage of
buildings, plants, or properties (square meters or acres) that are located in flood hazard areas in
addition to their location.
197
 This information could help investors evaluate the magnitude of a
registrant’s exposure to flooding, which, for example, could cause a registrant in the real estate
sector to lose revenues from the rental or sale of coastal property or incur higher costs or a
diminished ability to obtain property insurance, or a manufacturing registrant to incur increased
expenses due to the need to replace water-damaged equipment or move an entire plant.
Additional disclosure would be required if a material risk concerns the location of assets
in regions of high or extremely high water stress.198
 For example, some registrants might be
impacted by water-related chronic physical risks, such as increased temperatures and changes in
weather patterns that result in water scarcity. Registrants that are heavily reliant on water for
195 See letter from Wellington Management Co.
196 See letters from Action Center on Race and Economy (June 14, 2021); Americans for Financial Reform
Education Fund; Confluence Philanthropy; Domini Impact Investments; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation;
Public Citizen; and Revolving Door Project.
197 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i)(A).
198 See proposed 1502(a)(1)(i)(B).
61
their operations, such as registrants in the energy sector, materials and buildings sector, or
agriculture sector,199 could face regulatory restrictions on water use, increased expenses related
to the acquisition and purchase of alternative sources of water, or curtailment of its operations
due to a reduced water supply that diminishes its earning capacity. If the location of assets in
regions of high or extremely high water stress presents a material risk, the proposed rules would
require a registrant to disclose the amount of assets (e.g., book value and as a percentage of total
assets) located in such regions in addition to their location. The registrant would also be required
to disclose the percentage of its total water usage from water withdrawn in those regions.200

These disclosures could help investors understand the magnitude of a registrant’s material waterstress risks with a degree of specificity that might not be elicited under our current risk factor
disclosure standards.
Any increased temperatures could also materially impact a registrant in other ways. For
example, a registrant in the construction industry might be required to disclose the physical risk
of increased heat waves that affect the ability of its personnel to safely work outdoors, which
could result in a cessation or delay of operations, and a reduction in its current or future
earnings.201 A registrant operating in wildfire-prone areas could be exposed to potential
disruption of operations, destruction of property, and relocation of personnel in the event of heat199 Registrants in these industry sectors could be particularly susceptible to water-stress risks because operations in
these sectors require large amounts of water. See TCFD, Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, Section E (Oct. 2021), available at
https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Implementing_Guidance.pdf (discussing the
listed events and other risks).
200 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i)(B).

 See, e.g. How Seasonal Temperature Changes Affect the Construction Industry (constructconnect.com) (Aug.
15, 2018), available at https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/seasonal-temperature-changes-affectconstruction-industry.
62
induced wildfires.202 A registrant in the real estate sector might similarly be required to disclose
the likelihood that sea levels could rise faster than expected and reduce the value of its coastal
properties.203
The proposed rules would require a registrant to describe the nature of transition risks,
including whether they relate to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer,
business counterparty, and investor preferences), liability, reputational, or other transition-related
factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.204
 For example, an automobile manufacturer
might describe how market factors, such as changing consumer and investor preferences for lowemission vehicles, have impacted or will likely impact its production choices, operational
capabilities, and future expenditures. An energy producer might describe how regulatory and
reputational factors have impacted or are likely to impact its operational activities, reserve
valuations, and investments in renewable energy. An industrial manufacturer might describe
how investments in innovative technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, have impacted
or are likely to impact its consolidated financial statements, such as by increasing its capital
expenditures.
Climate related conditions and any transition to a lower carbon economy may also
present opportunities for companies and investors. The proposed rules would define “climaterelated opportunities” to mean the actual or potential positive impacts of climate-related
conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or
202
 See, e.g., The Impact of Wildfires on Business is Enormous | Are You Ready? (alertmedia.com) (Aug. 27, 2020),

203
 See, e.g., Climate change and the coming coastal real estate crash - Curbed (Oct. 16, 2018), available at
https://archive.curbed.com/2018/10/16/17981244/real-estate-climate-change-infrastructure.
204 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(ii).
63
value chains, as a whole.
205
 Efforts to mitigate or adapt to the effects of climate-related
conditions and events can produce opportunities, such as cost savings associated with the
increased use of renewable energy, increased resource efficiency, the development of new
products, services, and methods, access to new markets caused by the transition to a lower
carbon economy, and increased resilience along a registrant’s supply or distribution network
related to potential climate-related regulatory or market constraints. A registrant, at its option,
may disclose information about any climate-related opportunities it may be pursuing when
responding to the proposed disclosure requirements concerning governance, strategy, and risk
management in connection with climate-related risks. We are proposing to treat this disclosure
as optional to allay any anti-competitive concerns that might arise from a requirement to disclose
a particular business opportunity.
206
 By defining “climate-related opportunities,” the proposed
rules would promote consistency when such opportunities are disclosed, even if such disclosure
is not required.
2. Proposed Time Horizons and the Materiality Determination
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether any climate-related risk
is reasonably likely to have a material impact on a registrant, including its business or
consolidated financial statements, which may manifest over the short, medium, and long term.207

Several commenters made a similar recommendation, stating that disclosure of climate-related
205 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(b). The reference to ‘positive’ impact is intended to refer to the actual or
potential impact on the registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains as a
whole, rather than the mathematical impacts on a specific financial statement line item. See infra Section II.F.2
(discussing the proposed financial impact metrics, which focus on the line items in a registrant’s consolidated
financial statements).
206 Some commenters expressed concern about potential anti-competitive effects of the Commission’s possible
climate disclosure rules. See, e.g., letters from Association of General Contractors of America (June 11, 2021);
and Healthy Markets Association (June 14, 2021).

risks and impacts across short, medium, and long-term time horizons is necessary to fully
understand a registrant’s susceptibility to material climate-related risks.
208
As proposed, a registrant would be required to describe how it defines short-, medium-,
and long-term time horizons, including how it takes into account or reassesses the expected
useful life of the registrant’s assets and the time horizons for the registrant’s planning processes
and goals. We have not proposed a specific range of years to define short-, medium-, and longterm time horizons in order to allow flexibility for a registrant to select the time horizons that are
most appropriate to its particular circumstances.
As defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is
material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important
when determining whether to buy or sell securities or how to vote.
209
 As the Commission has
previously indicated, the materiality determination is largely fact specific and one that requires
both quantitative and qualitative considerations.210
 Moreover, as the Supreme Court has
articulated, the materiality determination with regard to potential future events requires an

2021); Clean Yield Asset Management; and Miller/Howard Investments; see also American Institute of CPAs
(AICPA) (June 11, 2021).
209 See 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (definition of “material”). See also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231, 232, and
240 (1988) (holding that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor
would consider the information important in deciding how to vote or make an investment decision; and
quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 449 (1977) to further explain that an omitted fact
is material if there is “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by
the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.”).
210 See Release No. 33-10064, Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K (Apr. 13, 2016), [81
FR 23915 (Apr. 22, 2016)] (discussing materiality in the context of, among other matters, restating financial
statements). See also Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (Aug. 12, 1999), available at
https://www.sec.gov/interps/account/sab99.htm (emphasizing that a registrant or an auditor may not substitute a
percentage threshold for a materiality determination that is required by applicable accounting principles). Staff

Commission's official approval. They represent interpretations and practices followed by the Division of
Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant in administering the disclosure requirements of the

assessment of both the probability of the event occurring and its potential magnitude, or
significance to the registrant.211
The materiality determination that a registrant would be required to make regarding
climate-related risks under the proposed rules is similar to what is required when preparing the
MD&A section in a registration statement or annual report. The Commission’s rules require a
registrant to disclose material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably
likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating
results or of future financial condition.212
 As the Commission has stated, MD&A should include
descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations as
well as matters that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on future operations.
213
The proposed rule serves to emphasize that, when assessing the materiality of a particular
risk, management should consider its magnitude and probability over the short, medium, and
long term. In the context of climate, the magnitude and probability of such risks vary and can be
significant over such time periods. For example, wildfires in California, which recently have
become more frequent and more intense, may be a material risk for wineries, farmers, and other
property owners.
214 Some insurance companies have withdrawn from certain wildfire prone
211
 See Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 238 (1988). When considering the materiality of different climaterelated risks, a registrant might, for example, determine that certain transition risks and chronic physical risks
are material when balancing their likelihood and impact. It also might determine that certain acute physical
risks are material even if they are less likely to occur if the magnitude of their impact would be high.
212 See 17 CFR 229.303(a).
213 See Release No. 33-10890, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and
Supplementary Financial Information (Nov. 19, 2020), [86 FR 2080, 2089 (Jan. 11, 2021)].
214 See, e.g., Daoping Wang, Dabo Guan, Shupeng Zhu, et al., Economic footprint of California wildfires in 2018,
Nature Sustainability (Dec. 2020) (stating that the frequency and size of wildfires in the western United States
66
areas after concluding the risk is no longer insurable.215 For many investors, the availability of
insurance and the potential exposure to damage, loss, and legal liability from wildfires may be a
determining factor in their investment decision-making. Moreover, registrants must bear in mind
that the materiality determination is made with regard to the information that a reasonable
investor considers important to an investment or voting decision.
To help ensure that management considers the dynamic nature of climate-related risks,
we are proposing to require a registrant to discuss its assessment of the materiality of climaterelated risks over the short, medium, and long term. We recognize that determining the likely
future impacts on a registrant’s business may be difficult for some registrants. Commenters have
noted that the science of climate modelling has progressed in recent years and enabled the
development of various software tools and that climate consulting firms are available to assist
registrants in making this determination.216 We also note that, under our existing rules,
registrants long have had to disclose forward-looking information, including pursuant to MD&A
requirements. To the extent that the proposed climate-related disclosures constitute forwardlooking statements, as discussed below,217 the forward-looking statement safe harbors pursuant
has been increasing for several decades, driven by decreases in precipitation and related changes in the moisture
in vegetation, which, together with land use and fire management practices, has dramatically increased wildfire
risks, culminating in a series of enormously damaging fires in California in 2017, 2018 and 2020); Andrew
Freedman, California wildfires prompt new warnings amid record heat, erratic winds, the Washington Post
(Oct. 1, 2020) (reporting that the “Glass Fire” forced about 80,000 to evacuate from Napa and Sonoma Counties
and took a heavy toll on the wine industry).

to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”)218 would apply, assuming the
conditions specified in those safe harbor provisions are met.
219
 We note, however, that there are
important limitations to the PSLRA safe harbor. For example, we are proposing that climaterelated disclosures would be required in registration statements, including those for initial public
offerings, and forward-looking statements made in connection with an initial public offering are
excluded from the protections afforded by the PSLRA. In addition, the PSLRA does not limit
the Commission’s ability to bring enforcement actions.
Request for Comment
8. Should we require a registrant to disclose any climate-related risks that are reasonably
likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business or consolidated
financial statements, which may manifest over the short, medium, and long term, as proposed?
If so, should we specify a particular time period, or minimum or maximum range of years, for
“short,” “medium,” and “long term?” For example, should we define short term as 1 year, 1-3
years, or 1-5 years? Should we define medium term as 5-10 years, 5-15 years, or 5-20 years?
Should we define long-term as 10-20 years, 20-30 years, or 30-50 years? Are there other
possible years or ranges of years that we should consider as the definitions of short, medium, and
long term? What, if any, are the benefits to leaving those terms undefined? What, if any, are the
218 Pub. Law 104-67, 109 Stat. 737.
219 See Securities Act Section 27A and Exchange Act Section 21E. The statutory safe harbors by their terms do not
apply to forward-looking statements included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The statutory safe harbors also would not apply to forward-looking
statements made: (i) in connection with an initial public offering; a tender offer; an offering by, or relating to
the operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program, an
offering of securities by a blank check company; a roll-up transaction; or a going private transaction; or (ii) by
an issuer of penny stock. See Section 27A(b) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act.
Also, the statutory safe harbors do not, absent a rule, regulation, or Commission order, apply to forward-looking
statements by certain “bad actor” issuers under Section 27A(b)(1)(A) of the Securities Act and Section
21E(b)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act.
68
concerns to leaving those terms undefined? Would the proposed provision requiring a registrant
to specify what it means by the short, medium, and long term mitigate any such concerns?
9. Should we define “climate-related risks” to mean the actual or potential negative impacts
of climate-related conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements,
business operations, or value chains, as proposed? Should we define climate-related risks to
include both physical and transition risks, as proposed? Should we define physical risks to
include both acute and chronic risks and define each of those risks, as proposed? Should we
define transition risks, as proposed? Are there any aspects of the definitions of climate-related
risks, physical risks, acute risks, chronic risks, and transition risks that we should revise? Are
there other distinctions among types of climate-related risks that we should use in our
definitions? Are there any risks that we should add to the definition of transition risk? How
should we address risks that may involve both physical and transition risks?
10. We define transition risks to include legal liability, litigation, or reputational risks.
Should we provide more examples about these types of risks? Should we require more specific
disclosures about how a registrant assesses and manages material legal liability, litigation, or
reputational risks that may arise from a registrant’s business operations, climate mitigation
efforts, or transition activities?
11. Some chronic risks might give rise to acute risks, e.g., drought (a chronic risk) that
increases acute risks, such as wildfires, or increased temperatures (a chronic risk) that increases
acute risks, such as severe storms. Should we require a registrant to discuss how the acute and
chronic risks they face may affect one another?
12. For the location of its business operations, properties or processes subject to an identified
material physical risk, should we require a registrant to provide the ZIP code of the location or, if
69
located in a jurisdiction that does not use ZIP codes, a similar subnational postal zone or
geographic location, as proposed? Is there another location identifier that we should use for all
registrants, such as the county, province, municipality or other subnational jurisdiction? Would
requiring granular location information, such as ZIP codes, present concerns about competitive
harm or the physical security of assets? If so, how can we mitigate those concerns? Are there
exceptions or exemptions to a granular location disclosure requirement that we should consider?
13. If a registrant determines that the flooding of its buildings, plants, or properties is a
material risk, should we require it to disclose the percentage of those assets that are in flood
hazard areas in addition to their location, as proposed? Would such disclosure help investors
evaluate the registrant’s exposure to physical risks related to floods? Should we require this
disclosure from all registrants, including those that do not currently consider exposure to
flooding to be a material physical risk? Should we require this disclosure from all registrants
operating in certain industrial sectors and, if so, which sectors? Should we define “flood hazard
area” or provide examples of such areas? If we should define the term, should we define it
similar to a related definition by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) as an
area having flood, mudflow or flood-related erosion hazards, as depicted on a flood hazard
boundary map or a flood insurance rate map? Should we require a registrant to disclose how it
has defined “flood hazard area” or whether it has used particular maps or software tools when
determining whether its buildings, plants, or properties are located in flood hazard areas? Should
we recommend that certain maps be used to promote comparability? Should we require
disclosure of whether a registrant’s assets are located in zones that are subject to other physical
risks, such as in locations subject to wildfire risk?
70
14. If a material risk concerns the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high
water stress, should we require a registrant to quantify the assets (e.g., book value and as a
percentage of total assets) in those regions in addition to their location, as proposed? Should we
also require such a registrant to disclose the percentage of its total water usage from water
withdrawn in high or extremely high water stressed regions, as proposed? If so, should we
include a definition of a “high water stressed region” similar to the definition provided by the
World Resource Institute as a region where 40-80 percent of the water available to agricultural,
domestic, and industrial users is withdrawn annually? Should we similarly define an “extremely
high water stressed area” as a region where more than 80 percent of the water available to
agricultural, domestic, and industrial users is withdrawn annually? Are there other definitions of
high or extremely high water stressed areas we should use for purposes of this disclosure?
Would these items of information help investors assess a registrant’s exposure to climate-related
risks impacting water availability? Should we require the disclosure of these items of
information from all registrants, including those that do not currently consider having assets in
high water-stressed areas a material physical risk? Should we require these disclosures from all
registrants operating in certain industrial sectors and, if so, which sectors?
15. Are there other specific metrics that would provide investors with a better understanding
of the physical and transition risks facing registrants? How would investors benefit from the
disclosure of any additional metrics that would not necessarily be disclosed or disclosed in a
consistent manner by the proposed climate risk disclosures? What, if any, additional burdens
would registrants face if they were required to disclose additional climate risk metrics?
71
16. Are there other areas that should be included as examples in the definitions of acute or
chronic risks? If so, for each example, please explain how the particular climate-related risk
could materially impact a registrant’s operations or financial condition.
17. Should we include the negative impacts on a registrant’s value chain in the definition of
climate-related risks, as proposed? Should we define “value chain” to mean the upstream and
downstream activities related to a registrant’s operations, as proposed? Are there any upstream
or downstream activities included in the proposed definition of value chain that we should
exclude or revise? Are there any upstream or downstream activities that we should add to the
definition of value chain? Are there any upstream or downstream activities currently proposed
that should not be included?
18. Should we define climate-related opportunities as proposed? Should we permit a
registrant, at its option, to disclose information about any climate-related opportunities that it is
pursuing, such as the actual or potential impacts of those opportunities on the registrant,
including its business or consolidated financial statements, as proposed? Should we specifically
require a registrant to provide disclosure about any climate-related opportunities that have
materially impacted or are reasonably likely to impact materially the registrant, including its
business or consolidated financial statements? Is there a risk that the disclosure of climaterelated opportunities could be misleading and lead to “greenwashing”? If so, how should this
risk be addressed?
72
C. Disclosure Regarding Climate-Related Impacts on Strategy, Business Model,
and Outlook
1. Disclosure of Material Impacts
Once a registrant has described the climate-related risks reasonably likely to have a
material impact on the registrant’s business or consolidated financial statements as manifested
over the short, medium, and long term as required by proposed Item 1502(a), proposed Item
1502(b) would require the registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of those risks on
its strategy, business model, and outlook.220
 Several commenters stated that many registrants
have included largely boilerplate discussions about climate-related risks and failed to provide a
meaningful analysis of the impacts of those risks on their businesses.221
 The TCFD’s most
recent assessment of public companies’ voluntary climate reports also noted that a minority of
companies disclosed the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on their businesses in
alignment with the TCFD framework.222
 Because information about how climate-related risks
have impacted or are likely to impact a registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook can be
important for purposes of making an investment or voting decision about the registrant, we are
proposing the provisions below to elicit robust and company-specific disclosure on this topic.
As proposed, a registrant would be required to disclose impacts on its:
• Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations;
220 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b).
221 See, e.g., letters from CALSTRS; Cardano Risk Management Ltd.; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab (June 14,
2021); and Colorado PERA (June 11, 2021).
222 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report, Section B (Oct. 2021) (stating that, based on a review of reports of 1,651 public
companies from 2018-2020, while 38-52% of companies surveyed described climate-related risks and
opportunities during 2018-2020, only 26-39% disclosed the impacts of those risks and opportunities during this
period).
73
• Products or services;
• Suppliers and other parties in its value chain;
• Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new
technologies or processes;
• Expenditure for research and development; and
• Any other significant changes or impacts.223
A registrant would also be required to disclose the time horizon for each described impact
(i.e., as manifested in the short, medium, or long term, as defined by the registrant when
determining its material climate-related risks).224

The proposed rules would require a registrant to discuss how it has considered the
identified impacts as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation.225
 A
registrant would be required to provide both current and forward-looking disclosures226 that
facilitate an understanding of whether the implications of the identified climate-related risks have
been integrated into the registrant’s business model or strategy, including how resources are
being used to mitigate climate-related risks.227
 The discussion must also include how any of the
metrics referenced in proposed Rule 14-02 of Regulation S-X and Item 1504 of Regulation S-K
or any of the targets referenced in proposed Item 1506 relate to the registrant’s business model or
business strategy.228
223 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(1).
224 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(2).
225 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(c).
226 See infra Sections II.C.3 and 4, II.E, II.G.1, and II.I regarding the application to forward-looking climate
disclosures of the PSLRA safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
227 See id.
228 See infra Sections II.F and II.G for a discussion of the proposed metrics and targets.
74
For example, a registrant that operates in a jurisdiction that has imposed or is likely to
impose limits on GHG emissions in support of the Paris Agreement might set a long-term target
of net zero GHG emissions from its operations in 2050, a medium-term target of reducing its
emissions by 30 percent by 2030, and a short-term target of maintaining its emissions at its 2020
rate through 2023. This registrant could face material transition risks due to the estimated costs
of the operational changes expected to be implemented to achieve these targets. The registrant
would be required to disclose these transition risks and their impacts on its strategy, business
model, and outlook.
Some of the described impacts would likely be common across industries and may
involve reducing a registrant’s Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions229 and incurring increased
expenses in the short term related to, for example, acquiring new technology to curb its
operational emissions and increasing the amount of electricity purchased from renewable
sources. Other described impacts of material transition risks, however, would likely vary by
industry. For example, an oil company might determine that a likely change in demand for fossil
fuel-based products would require it to modify its business model or alter its product mix to
emphasize advanced diesel gas and biofuels in order to maintain or increase its earning capacity,
thereby requiring disclosure under the proposed rules. An electric utilities company might
disclose an increase in the amount of electricity generated from less carbon-intensive sources,
such as wind turbines, nuclear, hydroelectric, or solar power to meet current or likely regulatory
constraints.
229 See supra Section I.D.2 and infra Section II.G for a discussion of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.
75
A registrant would also be required to disclose the material impacts of physical risks on
its strategy, business model, and outlook. For example, an agricultural producer or distributor
might disclose the likely impacts of drought on its own product mix or that of its suppliers,
including increased expenses for additional water or due to the procurement of alternative
product sources. Similarly, a mining company that operates in areas susceptible to extreme rise
in temperatures might disclose the likely impacts that this temperature rise has on its workforce
and on its production schedule, including a reduction in output and future earning capacity. A
real estate company that owns coastal property might disclose the likely impacts of rising sea
levels on such property, including the potential diminution in value of, and a potential change in
its strategy and outlook regarding, such properties.
The proposed rules would require a registrant to provide a narrative discussion of
whether and how any of its identified climate-related risks described in response to proposed
Item 1502(a) have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant’s consolidated
financial statements.230
 The discussion should include any of the financial statement metrics
disclosed pursuant to proposed Regulation S-X Rule 14-02.231
 As previously noted, many
commenters recommended that we require registrants to discuss and analyze their quantitative
climate data in a manner similar to that required for MD&A.232 Proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(d)
(Item 1502(d) of Regulation S-K) is intended to provide climate-related disclosure that is similar
230 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(d). To the extent that the proposed narrative discussion is provided in its
MD&A, a registrant could incorporate by reference that part of the MD&A into the Climate-Related Disclosure
section of the registration statement or report. See supra Section II.A.2.
231 See infra Section II.F.
232 See supra note 171.
76
to MD&A, although, as previously noted, a registrant may provide such disclosure as part of its
MD&A.
For example, an automobile manufacturer might discuss an increase in operating costs or
capital expenditures due to the need to revamp its assembly lines to build lower emission
vehicles to comply with new regulatory guidelines or to meet changing consumer demand. An
oil company might discuss a change in the valuation of its proven reserves because of an
anticipated reduced demand for fossil fuels. A freight company might discuss impairment
charges or early write-offs for older equipment it might need to replace due to anticipated
changes in regulation or policy favoring lower emissions equipment. While a registrant may
currently have an obligation to make some of these disclosures pursuant to Regulation S-X, the
disclosed impacts in the financial statements may not be in disaggregated form and may lack
explanation. Proposed Item 1502(d) would require the disclosure in the form of a narrative
analysis akin to MD&A that would be more easily accessible for investors.
Moreover, it is likely that any disclosed impacts in the financial statements would be
assessed for the fiscal years presented in the financial statements with a focus on near short-term
impacts. Because proposed Item 1502 would require a registrant to identify material climaterelated impacts that may manifest in the short, medium, and long term, a registrant’s narrative
discussion of the likely climate-related impacts on its consolidated financial statements should
cover more than just short-term impacts. For example, if a registrant has a transition plan233 that
includes the development of lower carbon products and processes, that registrant might disclose
that it expects to incur higher initial capital costs to implement its strategy, but anticipates
233 See infra Section II.E for proposed disclosure requirements regarding the use of a transition plan.
77
increased revenues or reduced expenses over the longer term. An automobile manufacturer that
transitions from the production of internal combustion engine vehicles to the production of
electric vehicles might disclose that it expects to incur costs in the short term to change its
manufacturing processes, but over the longer term, it expects to realize increased sales, protect
its market share against transition risks, including reputational risks, and potentially avoid
regulatory fines or other costs as consumer and regulatory demands change.
2. Disclosure of Carbon Offsets or Renewable Energy Credits If Used
If, as part of its net emissions reduction strategy, a registrant uses carbon offsets or
renewable energy credits or certificates (“RECs”), the proposed rules would require it to disclose
the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in the registrant’s climate-related business strategy.
234

Under the proposed rules, carbon offsets represent an emissions reduction or removal of
greenhouse gases in a manner calculated and traced for the purpose of offsetting an entity’s GHG
emissions.235
 We are proposing to define a REC, consistent with the EPA’s commonly used
definition, to mean a credit or certificate representing each purchased megawatt-hour (1 MWh or
1000 kilowatt-hours) of renewable electricity generated and delivered to a registrant’s power
grid.
236
 While both carbon offsets and RECs represent commonly used GHG emissions
mitigation options for companies, they are used for somewhat different purposes.237

234 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(c).
235 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(a).
236 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(n). See, e.g., EPA, Offsets and RECs: What's the Difference?, available at
https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-03/documents/gpp_guide_recs_offsets.pdf.
237 A company may purchase carbon offsets to address its direct and indirect GHG emissions (i.e., its Scopes 1, 2,
and 3 emissions) by verifying global emissions reductions at additional, external projects. The reduction in
78
Some registrants might plan to use carbon offsets or RECs as their primary means of
meeting their GHG reduction goals, including those formulated in response to government law or
policy or customer or investor demands. Other registrants, including those that set Science
Based Targets pursuant to the Science Based Targets Initiative,238 might develop strategies to
reduce their emissions to the extent possible through operational changes–such as modifications
to their product offerings or the development of solar or other renewable energy sources. They
then might plan to use carbon offsets or RECs to offset the remainder of their emissions that they
cannot reduce through operational changes or to meet their GHG reduction goals while they
transition to lower carbon operations.
Understanding the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in a registrant’s climate-related
business strategy can help investors gain useful information about the registrant’s strategy,
including the potential risks and financial impacts. A registrant that relies on carbon offsets or
RECs to meet its goals might incur lower expenses in the short term but could expect to continue
to incur the expense of purchasing offsets or RECs over the long term. It also could bear the risk
GHG emissions from one place (“offset project”) can be used to “offset” the emissions taking place somewhere
else (at the company’s operations). See, e.g., EPA, Offsets and RECs: What's the Difference?, available at
https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-03/documents/gpp_guide_recs_offsets.pdf. In contrast, a company
may purchase a REC in renewable electricity markets solely to address its indirect GHG emissions associated
with purchased electricity (i.e., Scope 2 emissions) by verifying the use of zero- or low-emissions renewable
sources of electricity. Each REC provides its owner exclusive rights to the attributes of one megawatt-hour of
renewable electricity whether that renewable electricity has been installed on the company’s facilities or
produced elsewhere. See id.
238 Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact,
World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which defines and promotes
best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science. SBTi provides technical
assistance and its expertise to companies who voluntarily set science-based targets in line with the latest climate
science. See SBTi, Who We Are/What We Do, available at https://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-us#who-weare. The SBTi does not permit offsets to be counted toward a company’s emission reduction targets to meet its
science-based targets but does permit offsets by companies that wish to finance additional emission reductions
beyond their science-based targets. See SBTi Criteria and Recommendations (Apr. 2020), available at
https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/legacy/2019/03/SBTi-criteria.pdf.

of increased costs of offsets or RECs if increased demand for offsets or RECs creates scarcity
and higher costs to acquire them over time. Alternatively, the value of an offset may decrease
substantially and suddenly if, for example, the offset represents protected forest land that burns
in a wildfire and no longer represents a reduction in GHG emissions. In that case, the registrant
may need to write off the offset and purchase a replacement. In other cases, increased demand
for, or scarcity of, offsets and RECs may benefit a registrant that produces or generates offsets or
RECs to the extent their prices increase. Accordingly, under the proposed rules, a registrant that
purchases offsets or RECs to meet its goals as it makes the transition to lower carbon products
would need to reflect this additional set of short and long-term costs and risks in its Item 1502
disclosure, including the risk that the availability or value of offsets or RECs might be curtailed
by regulation or changes in the market.
3. Disclosure of a Maintained Internal Carbon Price
Some registrants may use an internal carbon price when assessing climate-related factors.
Under the proposed definition, an internal carbon price is an estimated cost of carbon emissions
used internally within an organization.
239 Internal carbon pricing may be used by a registrant,
among other purposes, as a planning tool to help identify climate-related risks and opportunities,
as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs, to quantify the potential costs the
company would incur should a carbon price be put into effect, and to guide capital investment
decisions. If a registrant uses an internal carbon price, the proposed rules would require it to
disclose:
239 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(j).
80
• The price in units of the registrant’s reporting currency per metric ton of carbon dioxide
equivalent (“CO2e”);
240
• The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over time, if
applicable;
• The boundaries for measurement of overall CO2e on which the total price is based (if
different from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to 17 CFR
229.1504(e)(2);241 and
• The rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.242

These proposed items of disclosure would help investors understand the rationale and underlying
assumptions for a registrant’s internal carbon price and help them assess whether the registrant’s
use of an internal carbon price as a planning tool is reasonable and effective.
A registrant would also be required to describe how it uses its disclosed internal carbon
price to evaluate and manage climate-related risks.
243
 If a registrant uses more than one internal
carbon price, the proposed rules would require it to provide disclosures for each internal carbon
price, and to disclose its reasons for using different prices.244 For example, a registrant might
disclose that it uses different internal carbon prices when considering different climate-related
240 See infra Section II.G for a discussion of our proposal to use CO2e as a unit of measurement in the proposed
requirements.
241 See infra Section II.G.2 for a discussion of the proposed requirements for determining the GHG emission
organizational boundary.
242 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(1).
243 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(2).
244 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(3).
81
scenarios to help it develop an appropriate business strategy over the short-, medium-, and longterm.245

Commenters that addressed the topic of carbon price generally supported requiring its
disclosure in some form, such as: (i) establishing a broad-based carbon price; (ii) requiring
companies to maintain and disclose an internal carbon price; (iii) requiring disclosure of any
internal carbon price already used by a company; or (iv) requiring disclosure of carbon prices
used in the context of scenario analysis.246
 One commenter referred to disclosure of a company’s
use of internal carbon pricing as one of several “foundational climate disclosures” that should be
required in any Commission rule.247
 Another commenter also underscored the importance of this
information, stating that “the thorough quantification of climate risk has been hampered by the
lack of carbon pricing.”248
 We agree with commenters that supported the disclosure of carbon
pricing as a key data point for evaluating how a registrant is planning for and managing climaterelated risks. However, the proposed rules would not require registrants to maintain an internal
carbon price or to mandate a particular carbon pricing methodology. We are aware that many
registrants may not currently track this information and recognize that a robust carbon market on
which to base such a price may not exist in many contexts.249
 Accordingly, the proposed
245 See infra Section II.C.4 for the proposed disclosure required if a registrant uses scenario analysis.
246 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General, on behalf of several state attorney generals (June
14, 2021); Catavento; Center for Climate and Energy Solutions; Ceres; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab; Hermes
Equity Ownership Services Limited; Majedie Asset Management; Managed Funds Association; Norges Bank
Investment Management; Open Source Climate; PRI (Consultation Response); Regenerative Crisis Response
Committee; Total Energies (June 13, 2021); and Trillium Asset Management. But see Edison Electric Institute
(stating that a “‘robust carbon market’ does not exist today” and disclosures based on that market would be
“fraught with risk”).
247 Letter from Ceres.
248 Letter from PRI.
249 See Edison Electric Institute.
82
disclosures would be required only if the registrant otherwise maintains an internal carbon price.
For similar reasons, we have not proposed requiring a specific methodology for setting an
internal carbon price.
Registrants may choose to use an internal carbon price when quantifying, analyzing, and
assessing the financial impacts of climate-related risks and climate-related opportunities. For
example, an internal carbon price helps monetize emissions by converting emissions data from
CO2e into a value in the registrant’s reporting currency. A registrant may determine that
monetization is useful when assessing the costs and benefits of its possible climate-related
strategies, as it effectively puts a price on the emission impacts. Disclosure of an internal carbon
price, when used by a registrant, would provide investors with material information regarding
how the registrant developed a particular business strategy to mitigate or adapt to identified
climate-related risks and would help quantify for investors at least part of the transition risks
faced by a registrant. We believe that this proposed disclosure requirement would help investors
assess whether a registrant’s internal carbon pricing practice is reasonable and whether its overall
evaluation and planning regarding climate-related factors is sound.
250
A registrant’s disclosure of any internal carbon price necessarily would include
assumptions about future events. The carbon price applied should not be viewed as a promise or
guarantee with regard to the future costs to the registrant of GHG emissions. Moreover, to the
extent that certain information regarding a registrant’s internal carbon pricing would constitute
250 We also note, based on current voluntary reporting, an increasing trend among public companies to use internal
carbon pricing. See CDP, Putting a Price on Carbon (2021), available at
https://cdn.cdp.net/cdpproduction/cms/reports/documents/000/005/651/original/CDP_Global_Carbon_Price_report_2021.pdf?1618938
446.
83
forward-looking statements, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply to such statements, assuming
all other statutory requirements for those safe harbors are satisfied.
4. Disclosure of Scenario Analysis, if Used
We are proposing to require a registrant to describe the resilience of its business strategy
in light of potential future changes in climate-related risks. A registrant also would be required
to describe any analytical tools, such as scenario analysis, that the registrant uses to assess the
impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial statements, or to
support the resilience of its strategy and business model in light of foreseeable climate-related
risks.
251
 Scenario analysis is a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of
outcomes of future events under conditions of uncertainty.252 The proposed definition of
scenario analysis both states that (i) when applied to climate-related assessments, scenario
analysis is a tool used to consider how, under various possible future climate scenarios, climaterelated risks may impact a registrant’s operations, business strategy, and consolidated financial
statements over time; and that (ii) registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of
their strategies under future climate scenarios, including scenarios that assume different global
temperature increases, such as, for example, 3 °C, 2 °C, and 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels.253

251 See proposed 17 CFR229.1502(f).
252 See, e.g., the definition of “scenario analysis” in TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures.
253 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(o).
84
Many commenters recommended that we require a registrant to conduct scenario analysis
and disclose the results of such analysis.254
 One commenter stated that scenario analysis was
useful because it allows companies to test their business strategy against a spectrum of
hypothetical future climate scenarios and develop a better informed view of implications for their
enterprise value and value chains. The same commenter further indicated that disclosure of the
scenarios used by a company was necessary to inform investors about the reliability,
reasonableness, and resiliency of the company’s plans to address climate-related risks and
opportunities.255

Another commenter stated that the Commission should require disclosure of a registrant’s
climate scenario analysis by no later than 2025, and recommended that companies engage in
scenario analysis involving a base case, worse case, better case, and “Black Swan” scenarios
related to possible climate transition pathways.
256
 Alternatively, the commenter suggested that a
company take into account three scenarios: a smooth economic transition to +1.5 °C, which
would form the basis of the company’s net-zero strategy; a disorderly and, therefore, more costly
and disruptive transition to +1.5 °C; and a higher temperature scenario outcome of +3 °C of
warming, which would be associated with extreme physical effects and unprecedented economic
costs and disruption. This commenter further stated that robust disclosure of a company’s
254 See, e.g., letters from AllianceBernstein; Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund; R. Ted Atwood
(June 23, 2021); BlackRock; Bloomberg, LP; Boston Common Asset Management; Cardano Risk Management
Ltd.; Certified B Corporations; Climate Governance Initiative; Climate Risk Disclosure Law and Policy Lab
(June 14, 2021); Consumer Federation of America; CPP Investments; E2; ERM CVS; FAIRR Initiative; Forum
for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (June 11, 2021); Friends of the Earth et al.; George Georgiev;
Global Equity Strategy (June 14, 2021); Impax Asset Management; Invesco; Christopher Lish; NY State
Comptroller; PRI (Consultation Response); Revolving Door Project; RMI; Trillium Asset Management; UNEP;
and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Sean Casten (June 11, 2021).
255 See letter from Bloomberg.
256 See letter from Climate Governance Initiative.
85
scenario analysis was necessary so that investors can understand how longer-term “climate
drivers” have been incorporated into its corporate strategy and financial disclosures.
257

Another commenter expressed the view that, although many companies purport to use
scenario analysis in the climate context, their reporting regarding such use has been generally
deficient. That commenter stated that the assumptions underlying the selected scenarios often
are undisclosed and that the analysis tends to be limited and not usefully comparable.
258 The
TCFD’s most recent assessment of public companies’ voluntary climate reporting similarly
found that only a small percentage of the surveyed companies disclosed the resilience of their
strategies using scenario analysis as recommended by the TCFD.
259
Some commenters recommended providing certain accommodations in connection with a
scenario analysis requirement, such as creating a safe harbor for scenario analysis disclosure260
or permitting scenario analysis to be furnished in a separate report that would not be subject to
the same liability as Commission filings.
261
 Other commenters stated that they opposed a
scenario analysis requirement because of the lack of a common methodology for scenario
analysis;
262 a belief that the underlying methodology would be too difficult for investors to
257 See id.
258 See letter from Ceres. The CDP similarly reported that, although 54% of the 9600+ companies that responded
to their questionnaires in 2020 reported engaging in scenario analysis, 14% of the companies only considered
one scenario with many others considering only slight variations of one scenario. See CDP, 3 common pitfalls
of using scenario analysis – and how to avoid them (Mar. 10, 2021), available at
https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/companies/3-common-pitfalls-companies-make-when-using-scenario-analysisand-how-to-avoid-them.
259 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report, Section B (indicating that, during 2018-2020, only 5-13% of the surveyed
companies disclosed the resilience of their strategies using scenario analysis).
260 See letter from J. Robert Gibson.
261 See letter from NEI Investments.
262 See letter from Information Technology Industry Council.
86
understand;
263 the need for further development of scenario analysis as a discipline;
264 or a belief
that the focus of climate-related disclosure should be on historical data, and not on forwardlooking information.265

We agree with those commenters who stated that information concerning scenario
analysis could help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant’s business strategy in the
face of various climate scenarios that could impose potentially different climate-related risks.
We are not, however, proposing to mandate that registrants conduct scenario analysis. We
recognize that not every registrant conducts scenario analysis and that, in certain instances, it
may be costly or difficult for some registrants to conduct such scenario analysis. Instead, the
proposed rules would require that if a registrant uses scenario analysis or any analytical tools to
assess the impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial statements,
and to support the resilience of its strategy and business model, the registrant must disclose
certain information about such analysis.
266
 We believe this approach strikes an appropriate
balance between the various positions expressed by commenters by requiring registrants to share
any scenario analysis that they are otherwise conducting for their business operations while
avoiding imposing a potentially difficult or burdensome requirement on those registrants that
have not yet undertaken to conduct such analysis.
If a registrant uses scenario analysis, the proposed amendments would require disclosure
of the scenarios considered (e.g., an increase of no greater than 3 º, 2 º, or 1.5 ºC above pre263 See letter from Dimensional Fund Advisors.
264 See letter from bp.
265 See letter from Nareit (June 11, 2021).
266 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(f). One commenter recommended requiring the disclosure of the results of
scenario analysis if a registrant has engaged in such analysis. See letter from E3G.
87
industrial levels), including parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices, and the projected
principal financial impacts on the registrant’s business strategy under each scenario. The
disclosure should include both quantitative and qualitative information. Disclosure of the
parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices involved in the described scenarios would help
investors better understand the various considered scenarios and help them evaluate whether the
registrant has a plan to manage the climate-related risks posed by each scenario.
Because a registrant’s scenario analysis disclosure would necessarily include predictions
and other forward-looking statements based on assumptions concerning future events, we believe
that the PSLRA forward-looking safe harbors would apply to much of the disclosure concerning
scenario analysis provided the other statutory conditions for application of the safe harbor are
met.
We note that there are a number of publicly-available climate-related scenarios that could
form the basis of a registrant’s scenario analysis. The TCFD has categorized these scenarios as
transition scenarios and physical climate scenarios.267
 If a registrant uses scenario analysis to
assess the resilience of its business strategy to climate-related risks, investors may benefit from
the use of scientifically based, widely accepted scenarios, such as those developed by the IPCC,
International Energy Agency (“IEA”),
268 or Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for
Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”).
269
 Investors may also benefit by the use of more than
267 See TCFD, Technical Supplement, The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks and
Opportunities (June 2017), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/09/2020-
TCFD_Guidance-Scenario-Analysis-Guidance.pdf.
268 The TCFD has summarized a number of publicly available scenario analysis models, with particular emphasis
on the transition scenarios developed by the IEA and the physical risk scenarios developed by the IPCC. See id.
at Appendix 1: IEA and IPCC Climate Scenarios.
269 See NGFS, Scenarios Portal, available at https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/.
88
one climate scenario, including one that assumes a disorderly transition (i.e., one that assumes
that climate policies are delayed or divergent across countries and industrial sectors, resulting in
higher transition risks to companies). These could enhance the reliability and usefulness of the
scenario analysis for investors.
Request for Comment
19. Should we require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of its material
climate-related risks on its strategy, business model, and outlook, as proposed? Should we
require a registrant to disclose impacts from climate-related risks on, or any resulting significant
changes made to, its business operations, including the types and locations of its operations, as
proposed?
20. Should we require a registrant to disclose climate-related impacts on, or any resulting
significant changes made to, its products or services, supply chain or value chain, activities to
mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes,
expenditure for research and development, and any other significant changes or impacts, as
proposed? Are there any other aspects of a registrant’s business operations, strategy, or business
model that we should specify as being subject to this disclosure requirement to the extent they
may be impacted by climate-related factors?
21. Should we require a registrant to specify the time horizon applied when assessing its
climate-related impacts (i.e., in the short, medium, or long term), as proposed?
22. Should we require a registrant to discuss whether and how it considers any of the
described impacts as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation, as
proposed? Should we require a registrant to provide both current and forward-looking
disclosures to facilitate an understanding of whether the implications of the identified climate-
89
related risks have been integrated into the registrant’s business model or strategy, as proposed?
Would any of the proposed disclosures present competitive concerns for registrants? If so, how
can we mitigate such concerns?
23. Should we require the disclosures to include how the registrant is using resources to
mitigate climate-related risks, as proposed? Should the required discussion also include how any
of the metrics or targets referenced in the proposed climate-related disclosure subpart of
Regulation S-K or Article 14 of Regulation S-X relate to the registrant’s business model or
business strategy, as proposed? Should we require additional disclosures if a registrant leverages
climate-related financing instruments, such as green bonds or other forms of “sustainable
finance” such as “sustainability-linked bonds,” “transition bonds,” or other financial instruments
linked to climate change as part of its strategy to address climate-related risks and opportunities?
For example, should we require disclosure of the climate-related projects that the registrant plans
to use the green bond proceeds to fund? Should we require disclosure of key performance
metrics tied to such financing instruments?
24. If a registrant has used carbon offsets or RECs, should we require the registrant to
disclose the role that the offsets or RECs play in its overall strategy to reduce its net carbon
emissions, as proposed? Should the proposed definitions of carbon offsets and RECs be clarified
or expanded in any way? Are there specific considerations about the use of carbon offsets or
RECs that we should require to be disclosed in a registrant’s discussion regarding how climaterelated factors have impacted its strategy, business model, and outlook?
25. Should we require a registrant to provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any
of its identified climate-related risks have affected or are reasonably likely to affect its
consolidated financial statements, as proposed? Should the discussion include any of the
90
financial statement metrics in proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02 (14-02 of Regulation S-X) that
demonstrate that the identified climate-related risks have had a material impact on reported
operations, as proposed? Should the discussion include a tabular representation of such metrics?
26. Should we require registrants to disclose information about an internal carbon price if
they maintain one, as proposed? If so, should we require that the registrant disclose:
• The price in units of the registrant’s reporting currency per metric ton of CO2e;
• The total price;
• The boundaries for measurement of overall CO2e on which the total price is based if
different from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to 17 CFR
210.14-03(d)(4); and
• The rationale for selecting the internal or shadow carbon price applied, as proposed?
Should we also require registrants to describe the methodology used to calculate its internal
carbon price?
27. Should we also require a registrant to disclose how it uses the described internal carbon
price to evaluate and manage climate-related risks, as proposed? Should we further require a
registrant that uses more than one internal carbon price to provide the above disclosures for each
internal carbon price, and disclose its reasons for using different prices, as proposed? Are there
other aspects regarding the use of an internal carbon price that we should require to be disclosed?
Would disclosure regarding any internal carbon price maintained by a registrant elicit important
or material information for investors? Would requiring the disclosure of the registrant’s use of
an internal carbon price raise competitive harm concerns that would act as a disincentive from
the use of an internal carbon price? If so, should the Commission provide an accommodation
91
that would mitigate those concerns? For example, are there exceptions or exemptions to an
internal carbon price disclosure requirement that we should consider?
28. To the extent that disclosure that incorporates or is based on an internal carbon price
constitutes forward-looking information, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply. Should we adopt
a separate safe harbor for internal carbon price disclosure? If so, what disclosures should such a
safe harbor cover and what should the conditions be for such a safe harbor?
29. Should we require all registrants to disclose an internal carbon price and prescribe a
methodology for determining that price? If so, what corresponding disclosure requirements
should we include in connection with such mandated carbon price? What methodology, if any,
should we prescribe for calculating a mandatory internal or shadow carbon price? Would a
different metric better elicit disclosure that would monetize emissions?
30. Should we require a registrant to disclose analytical tools, such as scenario analysis, that
it uses to assess the impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial
statements, and to support the resilience of its strategy and business model, as proposed? What
other analytical tools do registrants use for these purposes, and should we require disclosure of
these other tools? Are there other situations in which some registrants should be required to
conduct and provide disclosure of scenario analysis? Alternatively, should we require all
registrants to provide scenario analysis disclosure? If a registrant does provide scenario analysis
disclosure, should we require it to follow certain publicly available scenario models, such as
those published by the IPCC, the IEA, or NGFS and, if so, which scenarios? Should we require
a registrant providing scenario analysis disclosure to include the scenarios considered (e.g., an
increase of global temperature of no greater than 3 º, 2 º, or 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels),
the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices, and the projected principal financial impacts
92
on the registrant’s business strategy under each scenario, as proposed? Are there any other
aspects of scenario analysis that we should require registrants to disclose? For example, should
we require a registrant using scenario analysis to consider a scenario that assumes a disorderly
transition? Is there a need for us to provide additional guidance regarding scenario analysis?
Are there any aspects of scenario analysis in our proposed required disclosure that we should
exclude? Should we also require a registrant that does not use scenario analysis to disclose that
it has not used this analytical tool? Should we also require a registrant to disclose its reasons for
not using scenario analysis? Will requiring disclosure of scenario analysis if and when a
registrant performs scenario analysis discourage registrants from conducting scenario analysis?
If so, and to the extent scenario analysis is a useful tool for building strategic resilience, how
could our regulations prevent such consequences?
31. Would the PSLRA forward-looking statement safe harbors provide adequate protection
for the proposed scenario analysis disclosure? Should we instead adopt a separate safe harbor
for scenario analysis disclosure? If so, what disclosures should such a safe harbor cover that
would not be covered by the PSLRA safe harbors and what should the conditions be for such a
safe harbor?
32. Should we adopt a provision similar to 17 CFR 229.305(d) that would apply the PSLRA
forward-looking statement safe harbor to forward-looking statements made in response to
specified climate-related disclosure items, such as proposed Item 1502 and Item 1505
(concerning targets and goals) of Regulation S-K? If so, which proposed items should we
specifically include in the safe harbor?
33. As proposed, a registrant may provide disclosure regarding any climate-related
opportunities when responding to any of the provisions under proposed 17 CFR 229.1502 (Item
93
1502). Should we require disclosure of climate-related opportunities under any or all of the
proposed Item 1502 provisions?
D. Governance Disclosure
Similar to the TCFD framework, the proposed rules would require a registrant to
disclose, as applicable, certain information concerning the board’s oversight of climate-related
risks, and management’s role in assessing and managing those risks.
270
 Many commenters
asserted that climate-related issues should be subject to the same level of board oversight as
other financially material matters.271
 Most of these commenters supported robust disclosure of a
board’s and management’s governance of climate-related risks and opportunities, consistent with
the TCFD framework.272

Our proposed disclosure requirements are based on specific recommendations of the
TCFD. We agree with commenters that a comprehensive understanding of a board’s oversight,
and management’s governance, of climate-related risks is necessary to aid investors in evaluating
270 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501.

the extent to which a registrant is adequately addressing the material climate-related risks it
faces, and whether those risks could reasonably affect the value of their investment.273
 We also
note that, despite the importance of governance disclosure, according to the TCFD, only a small
percentage of issuers that voluntarily provided climate-related information presented governance
disclosure aligned with the TCFD’s recommendations.274
 While the proposed rules are intended
to provide investors with additional insight into a board’s and management’s governance of
climate-related risks, they are similar to the Commission’s existing rules under Regulation S-K
that call for disclosure about corporate governance in that they are intended to provide investors
with relevant information about a registrant’s board, management, and principal committees.
275
1. Board Oversight
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose a number of board governance
items, as applicable. The first item would require a registrant to identify any board members or
board committees responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks.276
 The responsible board
committee might be an existing committee, such as the audit committee or risk committee, or a
separate committee established to focus on climate-related risks. The next proposed item would
require disclosure of whether any member of a registrant’s board of directors has expertise in
climate-related risks, with disclosure required in sufficient detail to fully describe the nature of
the expertise.277

273 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg, LP; and Natural Resources Defense Council.
274 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report (Oct. 2021) (finding that 9% of surveyed companies provided TCFDrecommended board disclosure in 2018, which increased to 25% in 2020; and 9% provided TCFDrecommended management disclosure in 2018, which increased to 18% in 2020).

276 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(i).
277 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(ii).
95
Another proposed item would require a description of the processes and frequency by
which the board or board committee discusses climate-related risks.
278
 The registrant would
have to disclose how the board is informed about climate-related risks, and how frequently the
board considers such risks. These proposed disclosure items could provide investors with insight
into how a registrant’s board considers climate-related risks and any relevant qualifications of
board members.
279
The proposed rule also would require disclosure about whether and how the board or
board committee considers climate-related risks as part of its business strategy, risk management,
and financial oversight.
280
 This disclosure could enable an investor to understand whether and
how the board or board committee considers climate-related risks when reviewing and guiding
business strategy and major plans of action, when setting and monitoring implementation of risk
management policies and performance objectives, when reviewing and approving annual
budgets, and when overseeing major expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures. In this way, the
proposed disclosure requirement could help investors assess the degree to which a board’s
consideration of climate-related risks has been integrated into a registrant’s strategic business
and financial planning and its overall level of preparation to maintain its shareholder value.
Finally, the proposed rule would require disclosure about whether and how the board sets
climate-related targets or goals and how it oversees progress against those targets or goals,
including the establishment of any interim targets or goals.281 Such a target might be, for
278 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(iii).
279 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg, LP; NY State Comptroller; and Vanguard Group, Inc.
280 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(iv).
281 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(a)(1)(v).
96
example, to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for all or a large percentage of its operations by
2050 or to reduce the carbon intensity of its products by a certain percentage by 2030 in order to
mitigate transition risk. This proposed requirement would help investors evaluate whether and
how a board is preparing to mitigate or adapt to any material transition risks, and whether it is
providing oversight for the registrant’s potential transition to a lower carbon economy. If
applicable, a registrant can elect also to discuss the board’s oversight of climate-related
opportunities.
2. Management Oversight
Similar to the proposed required disclosures on board oversight, the proposed rules would
require a registrant to disclose a number of items, as applicable, about management’s role in
assessing and managing any climate-related risks. For example, a registrant would be required to
disclose, as applicable, whether certain management positions or committees are responsible for
assessing and managing climate-related risks and, if so, to identify such positions or committees
and disclose the relevant expertise of the position holders or members in such detail as necessary
to fully describe the nature of the expertise.
282
 This proposed requirement would give investors
additional information to assess the extent to which management addresses climate-related risks,
which could help them to make better informed investment or voting decisions.
Similar to the proposed board oversight provision described above, another proposed
item would require disclosure about the processes by which the responsible managers or
management committees are informed about and monitor climate-related risks.
283
 Such a
discussion might include, for example, whether there are specific positions or committees
282 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(b)(1)(i).
283 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(b)(1)(ii).
97
responsible for monitoring and assessing specific climate-related risks, the extent to which
management relies on in-house staff with the relevant expertise to evaluate climate-related risks
and implement related plans of action, and the extent to which management relies on third-party
climate consultants for these same purposes.
The final proposed management governance item would require disclosure about whether
the responsible positions or committees report to the board or board committee on climaterelated risks and how frequently this occurs.
284
 These proposed disclosure items could help
investors evaluate whether management has adequately implemented processes to identify,
assess, and manage climate-related risks. If applicable, a registrant may elect also to describe
management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related opportunities.
Several commenters recommended that we require a registrant to disclose whether it has
connected a portion of its executive remuneration with the achievement of climate-related targets
or goals.
285
 Other commenters expressed the view that such a requirement is unnecessary,
because a registrant could implement other measures to motivate progress towards climaterelated targets286 or connect executive remuneration with climate-related achievements as a
discretionary matter for the registrant.287
 We are not proposing a compensation-related
disclosure requirement at this time, because we believe that our existing rules requiring a
compensation discussion and analysis should already provide a framework for disclosure of any
284 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1501(b)(1)(iii).
285 See, e.g., letters from Baillie Gifford; Andrew Behar; CDP; Climate Governance Initiative; E3G (June 14,

connection between executive remuneration and achieving progress in addressing climate-related
risks.

Request for Comment
34. Should we require a registrant to describe, as applicable, the board’s oversight of climaterelated risks, as proposed? Should the required disclosure include whether any board member
has expertise in climate-related risks and, if so, a description of the nature of the expertise, as
proposed? Should we also require a registrant to identify the board members or board committee
responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks, as proposed? Do our current rules, which
require a registrant to provide the business experience of its board members, elicit adequate
disclosure about a board member’s or executive officer’s expertise relevant to the oversight of
climate-related risks?
35. Should we require a registrant to disclose the processes and frequency by which the
board or board committee discusses climate-related risks, as proposed?
36. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether and how the board or board
committee considers climate-related risks as part of its business strategy, risk management, and
financial oversight, as proposed? Would the proposed disclosure raise competitive harm
concerns? If so, how could we address those concerns while requiring additional information for
investors about how a registrant’s board oversees climate-related risks?
288 See 17 CFR 229.402(b) (requiring disclosure of all material elements of a registrant’s executive compensation,
including the objectives of the registrant's compensation programs and what each compensation program is
designed to reward). Further, the Commission recently decided to reopen the comment period on rules to
implement section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires disclosure of the relationship between
executive compensation and the performance of the issuer. See Release No. 34-94074, Reopening of Comment
Period for Pay Versus Performance (Jan. 27, 2021).
99
37. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether and how the board sets climate-related
targets or goals, as proposed? Should the required disclosure include how the board oversees
progress against those targets or goals, including whether it establishes any interim targets or
goals, as proposed? Would the proposed disclosure raise competitive harm concerns? If so, how
could we address those concerns while requiring additional information for investors about how
a registrant’s board oversees the setting of any climate-related targets or goals?
38. Should we require a registrant to describe, as applicable, management’s role in assessing
and managing climate-related risks, as proposed? Should the required disclosure include
whether certain management positions or committees are responsible for assessing and managing
climate-related risks and, if so, the identity of such positions or committees, and the relevant
expertise of the position holders or members in such detail as necessary to fully describe the
nature of the expertise, as proposed? Should we require a registrant to identify the executive
officer(s) occupying such position(s)? Or do our current rules, which require a registrant to
provide the business experience of its executive officers, elicit adequate disclosure about
management’s expertise relevant to the oversight of climate-related risks?
39. Should we require a registrant to describe the processes by which the management
positions or committees responsible for climate-related risks are informed about and monitor
climate-related risks, as proposed? Should we also require a registrant to disclose whether and
how frequently such positions or committees report to the board or a committee of the board on
climate-related risks, as proposed?
40. Should we specifically require a registrant to disclose any connection between executive
remuneration and the achievement of climate-related targets and goals? Is there a need for such
100
a requirement in addition to the executive compensation disclosure required by 17 CFR
229.402(b)?
41. As proposed, a registrant may disclose the board’s oversight of, and management’s role
in assessing and managing, climate-related opportunities. Should we require a registrant to
disclose these items?
E. Risk Management Disclosure
1. Disclosure of Processes for Identifying, Assessing, and Managing ClimateRelated Risks
The proposed rules would require a registrant to describe any processes the registrant has
for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.289
 Risk disclosure is a longstanding disclosure concept under our regulations.290
 Several commenters recommended that we
adopt decision-useful disclosure requirements concerning a registrant’s climate-related risk
management practices.291
 More granular information regarding any climate-related risk
management could allow investors to better understand how a registrant identifies, evaluates, and
addresses climate-related risks that may materially impact its business. Such information could
also permit investors to ascertain whether a registrant has made the assessment of climate-related
289 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a).
290 Risk factor disclosure has been part of the Commission’s Securities Act disclosure requirements since prior to
and from adoption of its integrated disclosure system. See Release No. 33-6383, Adoption of Integrated
Disclosure System (Mar. 3, 1982). The Commission added risk factor disclosure to its Exchange Act
registration and annual reporting requirements in 2005. See Release No. 33-8591, Securities Offering Reform
(July 19, 2005) [70 FR 44722 (Aug. 3, 2005)].
291 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Boston Common Asset Management;
Carbon Tracker Initiative; Confluence Philanthropy; Hermes Equity Ownership Services Ltd.; The Institute for
Policy Integrity (“Policy Integrity”) at New York University School of Law, Environmental Defense Fund
(“EDF”), the Initiative on Climate Risk and Resilience Law (“ICRRL”), and Professors Madison Condon, Jim
Rossi, and Michael Vandenbergh (June 14, 2021) (“Institute for Policy Integrity, Environmental Defense Fund,
Initiative on Climate Risk & Resilience Law”); and Total Energies.
101
risks part of its regular risk management processes. Despite the importance of climate-related
risk management information, only a minority of registrants currently include such information
in their voluntary climate reports.
292
When describing the processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, the
registrant would be required to disclose, as applicable:
• How it determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared to other
risks;
• How it considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG
emissions limits, when identifying climate-related risks;
• How it considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes,
or changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and
• How it determines the materiality of climate-related risks, including how it assesses the
potential size and scope of any identified climate-related risk.
293
When describing any processes for managing climate-related risks, a registrant would be
required to disclose, as applicable:
• How it decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to a particular risk;
• How it prioritizes addressing climate-related risks; and
• How it determines how to mitigate a high priority risk.294
292 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report, Section B (indicating that, during 2018-2020, 16-30% of surveyed public
companies disclosed their climate risk identification and assessment processes, 14-29% disclosed their risk
management processes, and 10-27% disclosed whether their climate risk management processes were integrated
into their overall risk management).
293 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(1).
294 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(2).
102
Together, these proposed disclosures would help investors evaluate whether a registrant
has implemented adequate processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related
risks so that they may make better informed investment or voting decisions. As part of this risk
management description, if a registrant uses insurance or other financial products to manage its
exposure to climate-related risks, it may need to describe its use of these products.
295

The proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose whether and how climaterelated risks are integrated into the registrant’s overall risk management system or processes.296

If a separate board or management committee is responsible for assessing and managing climaterelated risks, a registrant would be required to disclose how that committee interacts with the
registrant’s board or management committee governing risks.297
 These proposed disclosures
would help investors assess whether the registrant has centralized the processes for managing
climate-related risks, which may indicate to investors how the board and management may
respond to such risks as they unfold.
2. Transition Plan Disclosure
Adoption of a transition plan to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks may be an
important part of a registrant’s climate-related risk management strategy, particularly if it
operates in a jurisdiction that has made commitments under the Paris Agreement to reduce its
GHG emissions. Many commenters recommended that we require disclosure regarding a
registrant’s transition plan, stating that such disclosure would help investors evaluate whether a
295 To the extent loss of insurance coverage or increases in premiums is reasonably likely to have a material impact
on the registrant, the registrant would be required to disclose that risk pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a).
296 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(b).
297 See id.
103
registrant has an effective strategy to achieve its short-, medium-, or long-term climate-related
targets or goals.
298

The proposed rules would define a “transition plan” to mean a registrant’s strategy and
implementation plan to reduce climate-related risks.
299
 A transition plan may include a plan to
reduce its GHG emissions in line with a registrant’s commitments or commitments of
jurisdictions within which it has significant operations.300
 Transition plans may also be
important to registrants and their shareholders to the extent transition risk arises from changes in
customer or business counterparty preferences, technological change, or changes in market
prices. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, the proposed rules would require it to
describe its plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage physical
and transition risks.301
 This information could help investors understand how a registrant intends
to address identified climate-related risks and any transition to a lower carbon economy while
managing and assessing its business operations and financial condition. Because transition
planning inherently requires judgments and predictions about the future, forward-looking
statements made as part of a registrant’s discussion of its transition plan would be eligible for the
PSLRA forward-looking statement safe harbors provided all applicable conditions are met.
302

If a registrant has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk management
strategy, the proposed rules would require the registrant to discuss, as applicable, how it plans to
298 See, e.g., letters from As You Sow; BlackRock; Clean Yield Asset Management; Climate Advisers; Climate
Governance Initiative; Fiends of the Earth et al; Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development;
Miller/Howard Investments; Trillium Asset Management; and World Benchmarking Alliance.
299 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(s).
300 See id.

302 See supra note 219.
104
mitigate or adapt to any physical risks identified in the filing, including but not limited to those
concerning exposure to sea level rise, extreme weather events, wildfires, drought, and severe
heat.
303
 For example, a company with significant operations in areas vulnerable to sea level rise
might plan to relocate its vulnerable operations as part of any transition plan. A company
operating in areas subject to severe storms might have a transition plan that includes reinforcing
its physical facilities to better withstand such weather events, or a plan to relocate those facilities.
An agricultural producer that operates in areas subject to increasing water stress might discuss its
plans to adjust its business strategy or operations, for example by developing or switching to
drought-resistant crops, developing technologies to optimize the use of available water, or
acquiring land in other areas.
304

The proposed rules would also require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as
part of its climate-related risk management strategy to discuss, as applicable, how it plans to
mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks, including the following:
• Laws, regulations, or policies that:
o Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including emissions
caps;305 or
o Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets;306
303 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(i).
304 A registrant would be required to disclose the expected impact of any potential reduction on its results of
operations or financial condition pursuant to proposed 17 CFR 229.1502 to the extent it believes the likely
impact would be material. Such quantified disclosure may be eligible for the PSLRA safe harbors if the
conditions of the safe harbors are met.
305 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1).
306 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2).
105
• Imposition of a carbon price;307 and
• Changing demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business
counterparties.308
While each of these transition risks may not be applicable to each registrant and its
particular transition plan, the above examples are intended to guide registrants in providing
meaningful disclosure about its risk management strategies that is not generic or boilerplate. In
this regard, it is important for investors to understand how a registrant plans to mitigate or adapt
to any identified transition risks in its transition plan given the potential associated costs and
burdens and their impact on the registrant’s business.
The proposed rules would require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of
its climate-related management strategy to update its disclosure about its transition plan each
fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve the plan’s targets or
goals.309
 This is intended to provide investors with information that can help them better
understand the registrant’s effectiveness in implementing any transition plan and the potential
risks and costs associated with what it still needs to accomplish.
A registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk
management strategy may also describe how it plans to achieve any identified climate-related
opportunities, such as:
• The production of products that facilitate the transition to a lower carbon economy, such
as low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure;
307 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(B).
308 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(2)(ii)(C).
309 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(c)(1).
106
• The generation or use of renewable power;
• The production or use of low waste, recycled, or other consumer products that require
less carbon intensive production methods;
• The setting of conservation goals and targets that would help reduce GHG emissions; and
• The provision of goods or services related to any transition to a lower carbon economy.310
For example, an energy company might discuss how, due to actual or potential regulatory
constraints, it intends to take advantage of climate-related opportunities by increasing the amount
of electricity purchased that is produced using renewable energy sources, reducing its medium
and long-range fossil fuel exploration and production, increasing the percentage of its products
consisting of biofuels and other lower emissions fuels, or investing in carbon capture and storage
technologies. A transportation company might discuss how, to mitigate reputational risk, it plans
to realize any climate-related opportunities presented by switching its existing fleet to one
composed of low- or no-emission vehicles by a certain date.311

Are there other items relevant to a registrant’s management of climate-related risks that
we should require it to disclose instead of or in addition to the proposed disclosure items?
45. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether and how the processes described in
response to proposed 17 CFR 229.1503(a) are integrated into the registrant’s overall risk
management system or processes, as proposed? Should we specify any particular aspect of this
arrangement that a registrant should disclose, such as any interaction between, and corresponding
roles of, the board or any management committee responsible for assessing climate-related risks,
if there is a separate and distinct committee of the board or management, and the registrant’s
committee in charge, generally, of risk assessment and management?
108
46. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, should we require the registrant to describe
the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage physical and
transition risks, as proposed? Would this proposed disclosure requirement raise any competitive
harm concerns and, if so, how can we mitigate such concerns? Would any of the proposed
disclosure requirements for a registrant’s transition plan act as a disincentive to the adoption of
such a plan by the registrant?
47. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, should we require it, when describing the
plan, to disclose, as applicable, how the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified
physical risks, including but not limited to those concerning energy, land, or water use and
management, as proposed? Are there any other aspects or considerations related to the
mitigation or adaption to physical risks that we should specifically require to be disclosed in the
description of a registrant’s transition plan?
48. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, should we require it to disclose, if applicable,
how it plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks, including the following, as
proposed:
• Laws, regulations, or policies that:
o Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including emissions
caps; or
o Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets?
• Imposition of a carbon price?
• Changing demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business
counterparts?
109
Are there any other transition risks that we should specifically identify for disclosure, if
applicable, in the transition plan description? Are there any identified transition risks that we
should exclude from the plan description?
49. If a registrant has adopted a transition plan, when describing the plan, should we permit
the registrant also to discuss how it plans to achieve any identified climate-related opportunities,
including, as proposed:
• The production of products that facilitate the transition to a lower carbon economy, such
as low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure?
• The generation or use of renewable power?
• The production or use of low waste, recycled, or environmentally friendly consumer
products that require less carbon intensive production methods?
• The setting of conservation goals and targets that would help reduce GHG emissions?
• The provision of services related to any transition to a lower carbon economy?
Should we require a registrant to discuss how it plans to achieve any of the above, or any other,
climate-related opportunities when describing its transition plan?
50. If a registrant has disclosed its transition plan in a Commission filing, should we require
it to update its transition plan disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during
the year to achieve the plan’s targets or goals, as proposed? Should we require a registrant to
provide such an update more frequently, and if so, how frequently? Would the proposed
updating requirement act as a disincentive to the adoption of a transition plan by the registrant?
51. To the extent that disclosure about a registrant’s transition plan constitutes forwardlooking information, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply. Should we adopt a separate safe

harbor for transition plan disclosure? If so, what disclosures should such a safe harbor cover and
what should the conditions be for such a safe harbor?
F. Financial Statement Metrics
1. Overview
If a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by subpart 229.1500 in a form that
also requires audited financial statements,312 under our proposal it would be required to disclose
in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated climate-related financial statement
metrics that are mainly derived from existing financial statement line items.
313 In particular, the
proposed rules would require disclosure falling under the following three categories of
information:
• Financial Impact Metrics;
• Expenditure Metrics; and
• Financial Estimates and Assumptions.
The proposed financial statement metrics disclosures would involve estimation
uncertainties that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other
financial statement disclosures (e.g., estimated loss contingencies, fair value measurement of
certain assets, etc.). Accordingly, for each type of financial statement metric, the proposed rules
would require the registrant to disclose contextual information to enable a reader to understand
312 For example, the climate-related note to the financial statements would not be required in a Form 10-Q filing.
See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(a). See infra note 690 and accompanying text, which discusses the
applicability of the proposed rules to foreign private issuers.
313 See FASB Concepts Statement No. 8, Chapter 8, par. D8 (“[T]he primary purpose of notes to financial
statements is to supplement or further explain the information on the face of financial statements by providing
financial information relevant to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors for making
decisions about providing resources to an entity.”).
111
how it derived the metric, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and
if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the specified metrics.314

A number of existing accounting standards could elicit climate-related disclosure in the
financial statements, as highlighted by the FASB in a Staff Educational Paper and by the IFRS in
a similar document.315
 Nevertheless, we believe the proposed rules would benefit registrants by
specifying when to provide such disclosures. Furthermore, the proposed rules may increase the
consistency and comparability of such disclosures by prescribing accounting principles for
preparing the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics disclosures, including, among
other things, provisions that would specify the basis of calculation for such metrics and their
presentation.
316

To avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency with the rest of the financial
statements, and aid comparability, registrants would be required to calculate the proposed
314 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(a). Inputs and assumptions may include the estimation methodology used to
disaggregate the amount of impact on the financial statements between the climate-related events and activities
and other factors. Policy decisions referenced herein may include a registrant’s election to disclose the impacts
from climate-related opportunities. See also infra Section II.F.2 for an example of contextual information that
would be required.
315 See FASB Staff Educational Paper, Intersection of Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters with
Financial Accounting Standards (Mar. 2021), available at
https://fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage&cid=1176176379917. See also IFRS, Effects of
climate-related matters on financial statements (Nov. 2020), available at

U.S.C. 7218(c); and Policy Statement: Reaffirming the Status of the FASB as a Designated Private-Sector
Standard Setter, Release No. 33-8221 (Apr. 25, 2003) [68 FR 23333 (May 1, 2003)], at 23334 (“While the
Commission consistently has looked to the private sector in the past to set accounting standards, the securities
laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, clearly provide the Commission with authority to set accounting
standards for public companies and other entities that file financial statements with the Commission.”). See
also FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 105-10-10-1 (“Rules and interpretive
releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission . . . are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
registrants.”).

financial statement metrics using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the
rest of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements included in the filing.317
 Therefore,
registrants would have to include in any such calculation financial information from consolidated
subsidiaries.318

For the avoidance of doubt, and to further promote consistency in the preparation of the
financial statements, the proposed basis of calculation requirements would also specify that a
registrant would be required to apply the same set of accounting principles that it is required to
apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing,
whenever applicable.
319
 Although 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(1) already states that financial statements
filed with the Commission that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP will be presumed
misleading or inaccurate unless the Commission has otherwise provided, clarifying the
application of this concept in the proposed rules may be helpful, given the possible confusion
that may arise between the current body of GAAP and the proposed requirements.
320

The proposed rules would also require disclosure to be provided for the registrant’s most
recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the registrant’s
317 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(c)(1).
318 See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.3-01(a) (“There shall be filed, for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated, audited
balance sheets as of the end of each of the two most recent fiscal years.”).
319 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(c)(2). Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under
home country GAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP (including the
provisions of the proposed rules) as the basis for calculating and disclosing the proposed climate-related
financial statement metrics. Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as
issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the proposed rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the
proposed climate-related financial statement metrics. For simplicity, we do not refer to the corresponding IFRS
in each instance where we refer to a FASB ASC. Accordingly, references in this release to a FASB ASC should
be read to also refer to the corresponding IFRS for foreign private issuers applying those standards. See also
infra note 690 which discusses proposed amendments to Form 20-F.
320 See also 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(2) (discussing the application of U.S. GAAP, IFRS, and the use of other
comprehensive sets of accounting principles (with reconciliation to U.S. GAAP)).

consolidated financial statements in the applicable filing.321
 For example, a registrant that is
required to include balance sheets as of the end of its two most recent fiscal years and income
statements and cash flow statements at the end of its three most recent fiscal years would be
required to disclose two years of the climate-related financial statement metrics that correspond
to balance sheet line items and three years of the climate-related financial statement metrics that
correspond to income statement or cash flow statement line items. If the registrant is an
emerging growth company (“EGC”)322 or SRC, only two years would be required.323

A registrant, however, would not need to provide a corresponding historical metric for a
fiscal year preceding its current reporting fiscal year if it is eligible to take advantage of the
accommodation in 17 CFR 230.409 (“Rule 409”) or 17 CFR 240.12b-21 (“Rule 12b-21”). For
example, if a registrant has not previously presented such metric for such fiscal year and the
historical information necessary to calculate or estimate such metric is not reasonably available
to the registrant without unreasonable effort or expense, the registrant may be able to rely on
Rule 409 or Rule 12b-21 to exclude a corresponding historical metric. Requiring disclosure of
current and, when known or reasonably available, historical periods, should allow investors to
analyze trends in the climate-related impacts on the consolidated financial statements and to
321 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-01(d).
322 An EGC is a registrant that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently
completed fiscal year and has not met the specified conditions for no longer being considered an EGC. See 17
CFR 230.405; 17 CFR 240.12b-2; 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19); 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80); and Inflation Adjustments and
Other Technical Amendments under Titles I and III of the JOBS Act, Release No. 33- 10332 (Mar. 31, 2017) [82
FR 17545 (Apr. 12, 2017)].
323 An EGC is only required to provide audited statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the
two fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as the
registrant has been in existence). See 17 CFR 210.3-02(a). A similar accommodation is provided to SRCs. See
17 CFR 210.8-02.

Request for Comment
52. Should we require a registrant to provide contextual information, including a description
of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the
registrant to calculate the specified metrics, as proposed? Should we revise the proposed
requirement to provide contextual information to require specific information instead? We
provide some examples of contextual information disclosure in Sections II.F.2 and II.F.3 below.
Would providing additional examples or guidance assist registrants in preparing this disclosure?
53. The proposed rules would specify the basis of calculation for the climate-related financial
statement metrics. Is it clear how to apply these accounting principles when calculating the
proposed climate-related financial statement metrics, or should we provide additional guidance?
Should we require a registrant to report these metrics with reference to its consolidated financial
statements, as proposed? If not, how should registrants report these metrics? If we were to
establish accounting principles (e.g., the basis for reporting these metrics) in a manner that
differs from the principles applicable to the rest of the consolidated financial statements, would
the application of those principles to the proposed metrics make climate-related disclosures less
clear, helpful, or comparable for investors?
54. Should we also require such metrics to be calculated at a reportable segment level when a
registrant has more than one reportable segment (as defined by the FASB ASC Topic 280
Segment Reporting)? In addition, should we require such metrics to be presented by geographic
324 See supra Section II.C.
115
areas that are consistent with the registrant’s reporting pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 280-10-50-
41? How would investors use such information?
55. The proposed rules would require disclosure for the registrant’s most recently completed
fiscal year and for the corresponding historical fiscal years included in the registrant’s
consolidated financial statements in the filing. Should disclosure of the climate-related financial
statement metrics be required for the fiscal years presented in the registrant’s financial
statements, as proposed? Instead, should we require the financial statement metrics to be
calculated only for the most recently completed fiscal year presented in the relevant filing?
Would requiring historical disclosure provide important or material information to investors,
such as information allowing them to analyze trends? Are there other approaches we should
consider?
56. Should information for all periods in the consolidated financial statements be required for
registrants that are filing an initial registration statement or providing climate-related financial
statement metrics disclosure for historical periods prior to the effective date or compliance date
of the rules? Would the existing accommodation in Rules 409 and 12b-21 be sufficient to
address any potential difficulties in providing the proposed disclosures in such situations?
57. Should we provide additional guidance as to when a registrant may exclude a historical
metric for a fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year?
58. In several instances, the proposed rules specifically point to existing GAAP and, in this
release, we provide guidance with respect to the application of existing GAAP. Are there other
existing GAAP requirements that we should reference? Are there instances where it would be
preferable to require an approach based on TCFD guidance or some other framework, rather than
requiring the application of existing GAAP?
116
2. Financial Impact Metrics
As discussed above, proposed Item 1502(d) of Regulation S-K would require a registrant
to provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any of its identified climate-related risks
have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant’s consolidated financial
statements.325
 The term “climate-related risks” would be defined, in part, as the actual or
potential negative impacts of climate-related conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated
financial statements.326
 “Climate-related risks” would also be defined to include physical risks,
such as extreme weather events, and transition risks.327
 To complement this proposed
requirement in Regulation S-K to provide narrative disclosure about impacts on a registrant’s
consolidated financial statements, we are proposing to amend Regulation S-X to require a
registrant to include disaggregated information about the impact of climate-related conditions
and events, and transition activities, on the consolidated financial statements included in the
relevant filing,
328 unless such impact is below a specified threshold.
We are proposing to require disclosure of the impacts from severe weather events and
other natural conditions and transition activities, which should capture a broad spectrum of these
two types of climate-related risks (physical risks and transition risks). In addition, the proposed
rules would require disclosure of the impacts of any climate-related risks identified pursuant to
proposed Item 1502(a)—both physical risks (“identified physical risks”) and transition risks
325 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502(d).
326 See supra Section II.B.1 (discussing the definition of “climate-related risks”).
327
 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(c) (defining “climate related risks” to include “physical risks” and “transition
risks”).
328 For example, the impact on the income statement line items for the periods presented in the financial statements
in a registrant’s Form 10-K.
117
(“identified transition risks”)—on any of the financial statement metrics.
329 Among the
examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions that we have highlighted in the
proposed rule are those that the Commission identified more than a decade ago in the 2010
Guidance as potentially affecting a registrant’s operations and results.330
 In addition, although
not specifically mentioned in the 2010 Guidance, we are including wildfires as an example
because it is well recognized as another type of natural event that can have significant impacts on
a registrant’s financial statements.
331
 Providing examples of severe weather events, other natural
conditions, and transition activities in the proposed rule would aid in the comparability of the
resulting disclosure while assisting issuers in making the disclosures.
Specifically, we are proposing that impacts on any relevant line item in the registrant’s
consolidated financial statements during the fiscal years presented arising from severe weather
events and natural conditions, and the identified physical risks (collectively, “climate-related
events”), would trigger the proposed disclosure requirement discussed below. Specific examples
of such severe weather events and natural conditions may include the following:
• Flooding;
• Drought;
329
 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(i).
330 See, e.g., 2010 Guidance, 26 (“Significant physical effects of climate change, such as effects on the severity of
weather (for example, floods or hurricanes), [and] sea levels . . . have the potential to affect a registrant’s
operations and results.”). Temperature extremes and drought are also discussed in the 2010 Guidance. See,
e.g., id. at 6-7.
331 See, e.g., Aurora A. Gutierrez et al., Wildfire response to changing daily temperature extremes in California’s
Sierra Nevada, Science Advances, Vol. 7, Issue 47 (Nov. 17, 2021) (“Our work supports the conclusion that
considerable potential exists for an increase in fire activity as a consequence of climate warming in the absence
of changes in fire and ecosystem management.”); U.S. Geological Survey, Will global warming produce more
frequent and more intense wildfires? (“[R]esearchers have found strong correlations between warm summer
temperatures and large fire years, so there is general consensus that fire occurrence will increase with climate
change.”), available at https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/will-global-warming-produce-more-frequent-and-moreintense-wildfires.
118
• Wildfires;
• Extreme temperatures; and
• Sea level rise.
332
As discussed, above, there has been increased recognition of the current and potential
effects, both positive and negative, of these events and the associated physical risks on a
registrant’s business as well as its financial performance and position. For example, as
mentioned above, the 2010 Guidance discusses the potential impacts on a registrant’s business
and financial performance from climate-related events, including, for example, severe weather
events, that could negatively impact a registrant’s supply chain or distribution chain and lead to
higher input costs or delayed product deliveries.333
 The 2010 Guidance also points to credit risks
for banks driven by borrowers with assets located in high risk coastal areas.334
 More recently,
the FSOC’s Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk 2021 discusses significant costs from the
types of events included in proposed Rule 14-02(c).
335
 The TCFD, in a recent publication, also
discusses the potential financial impacts of such climate-related events.336 Furthermore, the
TCFD provides examples of disclosures already being made by some companies (including
332 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(c).
333 See 2010 Guidance, 6.
334 See id.
335 See, e.g., 2021 FSOC Report, Chapter 1: From Climate-related Physical Risks to Financial Risks (discussing
the listed events and other risks).

2021), Section A.4 Assessing Financial Impacts of Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities.

registrants) of the financial statement impact of the climate-related events discussed above in
their standalone sustainability (or equivalent) reports.
337

Generally, climate-related events such as severe weather events and other natural
conditions, and climate-related risks more generally, are linked to negative impacts on a
registrant’s financial performance and position. There could be situations, however, where such
events result in positive impacts. For example, if a registrant’s business is to conduct postdisaster cleanup and reconstruction, the occurrence of such severe weather events would
generate additional revenues for the registrant.
In addition to the physical risks associated with climate change, registrants and investors
also face climate-related transition risks. As government leaders across the globe have made
public commitments to transition to a lower carbon economy, investors have sought information
about the impact such a transition may have on registrants.338
 In addition to public
commitments, these impacts may be prompted by regulatory, technological, market (including
changing consumer, business counterparty, and investor preferences), liability, reputational, or
other transition-related factors.
339
 For example, significant shifts in modes of production may
occur in GHG intensive economic sectors, such as the transportation, electricity generation, and
heavy manufacturing sectors.340
 A registrant that is engaged in transition activities may
experience business losses or, conversely, may benefit from such transition activities.
341
 In
337 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), 23 (Figure C6), Appendix 2,
available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-Metrics_Targets_Guidance-1.pdf (providing
examples, mostly from sustainability (or equivalent) reports, that illustrate the feasibility of some of the
disclosures that would be required by the proposed rules).
338 See supra Section I.C.1.
339 See supra Section II.B.
340 See, e.g., 2021 FSOC Report, Chapter 1, From Climate-related Transition Risks to Financial Risks.
341 See id.
120
response, some companies are already providing disclosure of the impact of transition-related
activities on their financial statements and some have publicly made commitments related to this
transition.
342
 In light of these transition risks, the proposed rules would also require a registrant
to disclose the financial impact of the impact of any identified transition risks and any efforts to
reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks (collectively,
“transition activities”) on any relevant line items in the registrant’s consolidated financial
statements during the fiscal years presented.343

A registrant may also disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe
weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate-related
opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate-related
opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a), on
any of the financial statement metrics.344
 If a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the
impact of a climate-related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so
consistently (e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each
financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the registrant) and must
follow the same presentation and disclosure threshold requirements applicable to the required
disclosures related to financial impact metrics and expenditure metrics, as discussed below.345

The financial impact metric disclosure requirements in proposed Rules 14-02(c), (d), and
(i) would require a registrant to disclose the financial impacts of severe weather events, other
342 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 2.
343
 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(d).
344
 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(j).
345 See id.
121
natural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks on the consolidated
financial statements included in the relevant filing unless the aggregated impact of the severe
weather events, other natural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks
is less than one percent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year.346
 The proposed
threshold would provide a bright-line standard for registrants and should reduce the risk of
underreporting such information. The proposed quantitative threshold could also promote
comparability and consistency among a registrant’s filings over time and among different
registrants compared to a principles-based approach. The Commission has used similar one
percent thresholds in other contexts.347
 More generally, in addition to the approach in Article 5
of Regulation S-X discussed below, other rules such as 17 CFR 229.103 and 17 CFR 229.404
use quantitative disclosure thresholds to facilitate comparability, consistency, and clarity in
determining when information must be disclosed.348

A registrant would be required to determine the impacts of the severe weather events,
other natural conditions, transition activities, and identified climate-related risks described above
on each consolidated financial statement line item.
349
 Within each category (i.e., climate-related
346 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(b). The registrant would be required to evaluate the impact on a line-by-line
basis consistent with the line items presented in its consolidated financial statements. See proposed 17 CFR
210.14-02(c) and (d).
347 The Commission currently uses a 1% threshold in other contexts for disclosure of certain items within the
financial statements and without. See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.5-03.1(a) (stating that if the total of sales and revenues
reported under this caption includes excise taxes in an amount equal to 1% or more of such total, the amount of
such excise taxes shall be shown on the face of the statement parenthetically or otherwise); 17 CFR 210.12-13
(requiring disclosure of open option contracts by management investment companies using a 1% of net asset
value threshold, based on the notional amounts of the contracts); and 17 CFR 229.404(d) (requiring disclosure
of transactions between a SRC and related persons in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000
or 1% of the average of the SRC’s total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years).
348 See 17 CFR 229.103(b)(2), (c)(3)(iii) and 17 CFR 229.404(a).
349 Examples of such line items include revenue, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses, sale
of property, plant, and equipment (in statement of cash flows), inventories, intangible assets, long-term debt, or
contingent liabilities.
122
events or transition activities), impacts would, at a minimum, be required to be disclosed on an
aggregated, line-by-line basis for all negative impacts and, separately, on an aggregated, line-byline basis for all positive impacts.
350
 However, for purposes of determining whether the
disclosure threshold has been met, a registrant would be required to aggregate the absolute value
of the positive and negative impacts on a line-by-line basis, which we believe would better
reflect the significance of the impact of the climate-related events and transition activities on a
registrant’s financial performance and position.
351

For example, when evaluating the line-by-line impact, a registrant may determine that its
cost of revenue is impacted by Events A, B, and C, and Transition Activity D in the following
manner:
• Cost of revenue was impacted negatively by Events A and B by $300,000, driven by
increased input costs impacted by severe weather events that strained the registrant’s
main supplier;
• Cost of revenue was impacted positively by Event C by $70,000, driven by technology
that improved the registrant’s ability to manage the impact of severe heat on certain raw
materials, which resulted in more efficient production; and
• Cost of revenue was impacted positively by Transition Activity D, which reduced
production costs for certain products by $90,000 through advanced technology that
improved energy efficiency during the production process.
352
350 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(c) and (d).
351 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(b).
352 This example illustrates a situation where the registrant has elected to include impacts from transition
opportunities.
123
For purposes of determining whether the impacts from the example above would trigger
the disclosure threshold requirements, the registrant would perform the analysis illustrated in the
following table:
F/S line-item F/S balance (from
consolidated
financial
statements)
Impact of
Events
A and B

Percentage
impact
Cost of revenue $10,000,000 -$300,000 +$70,000 +$90,000 $460,000 4.6%
Although some of the impacts (e.g., impact of Event C, impact of Transition Activity D)
do not individually meet the one percent threshold, the absolute value of the aggregated impacts
from the events and transition activities on the line item in the above example is $460,000 and
thus exceeds one percent of the corresponding line-item threshold; therefore, disclosure for that
specific line item would be required. The registrant’s disclosure of such impacts may be
provided, for example, as illustrated in the following table (excluding disclosure of contextual
information):
Note X. Climate-related financial metrics:

(Debit) $300,000 (Credit) $70,000 --- (Credit) $90,000
* As discussed earlier, a registrant may elect to include the impact of climate-related opportunities when
calculating its climate-related financial impact metrics. This example illustrates a situation where the registrant
has elected to include impacts from transition opportunities.
In this example, contextual information may include disclosure such as the registrant’s
election to include the impact from opportunities in its disclosure analysis and calculation, the
specific events that were aggregated for purposes of determining the impact on the cost of
revenue and, if applicable, a discussion of the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the
124
amount of impact on the cost of revenue between the climate-related events, transition activities,
and other factors.
To provide additional clarity, the proposed rule would include the following examples of
disclosures that may be required to reflect the impact of the severe weather events and other
natural conditions on each line item of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements (e.g.,
line items of the consolidated income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement):353
• Changes to revenue or costs from disruptions to business operations or supply chains;
• Impairment charges and changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as inventory,
intangibles, and property, plant and equipment) due to the assets being exposed to severe
weather, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise;
• Changes to loss contingencies or reserves (such as environmental reserves or loan loss
allowances) due to impact from severe weather events; and
• Changes to total expected insured losses due to flooding or wildfire patterns.354
With respect to the financial impacts of transition activities, the proposed rule would
include the following examples of potential impacts:
• Changes to revenue or cost due to new emissions pricing or regulations resulting in the
loss of a sales contract;
• Changes to operating, investing, or financing cash flow from changes in upstream costs,
such as transportation of raw materials;
353 The examples below, like all of the examples in this release (including examples in the text of the proposed
rules), are non-exclusive and should not be interpreted as a checklist for compliance with any proposed rule.
354 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(c)(1) through (4).
125
• Changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as intangibles and property, plant, and
equipment), for example, due to a reduction of the asset’s useful life or a change in the
asset’s salvage value by being exposed to transition activities; and
• Changes to interest expense driven by financing instruments such as climate-linked bonds
issued where the interest rate increases if certain climate-related targets are not met.355
Many commenters stated that climate-related financial disclosure is material and should
be reflected separately in the financial statements.356
 For example, one commenter stated that it
is critical to investors and others in assessing a company’s risk profile, estimating its riskadjusted returns, and completing other relevant financial analyses to include information on how
climate-related risks and climate-related opportunities may affect companies’ income statements,
cash flow statements, and balance sheets.357

Other commenters, however, generally expressed the view that if such disclosures are
material, they would already be required by existing financial statement disclosure
requirements.
358
 For example, some of these commenters stated that they opposed new climatespecific disclosure rules because, in their view, the traditional concept of materiality already

requires the disclosure of climate-related impacts that materially affect the issuer’s financial
condition and results of operations.
359

Although we agree that registrants are currently required to disclose material financial
impacts on the financial statements, the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics
should provide additional transparency into the impact of climate-related events on information
reported in the financial statements that would be relevant to investors when making investment
or voting decisions.360
 Such disclosure would also provide investors with additional insights into
the nature of a registrant’s business, the implementation of the registrant’s targets and goals, and
material trends in climate-related impacts. Furthermore, separately stating the financial
statement impacts from the climate-related events and transition activities could improve
comparability across both the registrant’s year-to-year disclosures and the disclosures of
different registrants.
We further note that the proposed requirement to separately disclose the financial impacts
of the climate-related events and transition activities may be necessary not only because climaterelated risks may have significant impacts on individual registrants, but also because the risks
presented by the climate-related events and transition activities may be correlated across
359 See letters from American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers; Environmental Bankers Association; and The
Associated General Contractors of America.
360 Certain commenters, in response to FASB’s 2021 Agenda Consultation, were also supportive of more
disaggregated disclosures within the financial statements. See, e.g., letters from CalPERS (Sept. 22, 2021);
CFA Institute (Oct. 7, 2021); and CII (Sept. 16, 2021). Comment letters in response to FASB’s invitation to

different, similarly situated registrants.
361 Climate-related risks present the potential for a high
correlation and therefore concentration of risk within a portfolio. Separate disclosure of climaterelated risks could help to provide investors with information to help them more effectively
evaluate their portfolio risk. In this regard, we note that an analogous approach to disaggregated,
or separately stated, disclosure has been taken in other contexts within the financial statements
and elsewhere.362
 For example, in segment reporting, a registrant must present within its
consolidated financial statements a separate presentation of certain financial statement line items
for each segment.363
 The Commission has noted the importance of disaggregated disclosure in
361 See, e.g., Madison Condon, Market Myopia's Climate Bubble, 2022 UTAH L. REV. 63 (2021). See also 2020
CFTC Advisory Subcommittee Report (“Climate change is expected to affect multiple sectors, geographies, and
assets in the United States, sometimes simultaneously and within a relatively short timeframe. As mentioned
earlier, transition and physical risks—as well as climate and non-climate-related risks—could interact with each
other, amplifying shocks and stresses. This raises the prospect of spillovers that could disrupt multiple parts of
the financial system simultaneously.”).
362 The analogies presented are not intended to imply that FASB ASC Topic 280, IFRS 8 or other concepts would
have to be applied when accounting for and disclosing the climate-related financial statement metrics. The
analogies are also not intended to imply that the determination of when disclosure may be required and how that
determination is made is the same across all of these concepts. See, e.g., infra note 363 (discussing
management’s evaluation under FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting and IFRS 8 Operating Segments)
and the discussion below of FASB ASC Topic 606, IFRS 15, and Article 5 of Regulation S-X.
363 See FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting and IFRS 8 Operating Segments (requiring segment reporting
disclosures to be included in the audited financial statements). FASB ASC 280-10-10-1 states that the objective
of segment reporting is to provide information about the different types of business activities in which a
registrant engages and the different economic environments in which it operates to help users of financial
statements: (i) better understand the public entity’s performance; (ii) better assess its prospects for future net
cash flows; and (iii) make more informed judgments about the public entity as a whole. FASB ASC Topic 280
and IFRS 8 focus on the chief operating decision maker’s view when evaluating the registrant and prescribes
certain qualitative and quantitative considerations when determining what constitutes an operating segment.
Similarly, the proposed rule would require an initial determination by the registrant of the relevant climaterelated events and transition activities, and their impact on the registrant’s financial statements.
128
the segment reporting context, stating that it “has long been aware of the importance of
meaningful segment information to reasoned investment decision-making.”
364

The importance of disaggregated disclosure in a registrant’s financial statements is also
supported by the concepts set forth in FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which require, among other
things, disclosure of disaggregated revenue recognized from contracts with customers into
categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
are affected by economic factors. As noted earlier, the Commission also requires disaggregation
of certain financial statement line items in Article 5 of Regulation S-X. Specifically, Article 5
requires separate disclosures of specific balance sheet and income statement line items when
practicable or when certain percentage thresholds are met, depending on the nature of the
information.365 Those conditions on when separate disclosure is required are analogous to the
proposed condition that financial impacts result from the climate-related events and transition
activities.

Would presenting climate-specific financial information on a separate basis based on climaterelated events (severe weather events and other natural conditions and identified physical risks)

6737-01 (Feb. 23, 1984)], at 6738. Robust segment reporting disclosures are important as they can provide
crucial transparency to investors that are reviewing financial statements. See also Gary Buesser, For the
Investor: Segment Reporting, FASB OUTLOOK (Apr. 2019) (“[I]nvestors normally model a company at the
segment level rather than at the consolidated level. More segments and greater information about an operating

and transition activities (including identified transition risks) elicit decision-useful or material
information for investors? Are there different metrics that would result in disclosure of more
useful information about the impact of climate-related risks and climate-related opportunities on
the registrant’s financial performance and position?
60. Would the impact from climate-related events and transition activities yield decisionuseful information for investors? Would the climate-related events (including the examples
provided) and transition activities result in impacts that are easier to quantify or disaggregate
than climate-related risks more generally? Would a registrant be able to quantify and provide the
proposed disclosure when the impact may be the result of a mixture of factors (e.g., a factory
shutdown due to an employee strike that occurs simultaneously with a severe weather event)? If
there are situations where disaggregation would not be practicable, should we require a registrant
to disclose that it was unable to make the required determination and why, or to make a
reasonable estimate and provide disclosure about the assumptions and information that resulted
in the estimate?
61. Alternatively, should we not require disclosure of the impacts of identified climaterelated risks and only require disclosure of impacts from severe weather events and other natural
conditions? Should we require a registrant to disclose the impact on its consolidated financial
statements of only certain examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions? If so,
should we specify which severe weather events and other natural conditions the registrant must
include? Would requiring disclosure of the impact of a smaller subset of climate-related risks be
easier for a registrant to quantify without sacrificing information that would be material to
investors?
130
62. Should impact from climate-related opportunities be required, instead of optional, as
proposed? We are proposing to require a registrant that elects to disclose the impact of an
opportunity to do so consistently (e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial
statements, for each financial statement line item, and for all relevant opportunities identified by
the registrant). Are there any other requirements that we should include to enhance consistency?
Should we only require consistency between the first fiscal period in which opportunities were
disclosed and subsequent periods?
63. Is it clear which climate-related events would be covered by “severe weather events and
other natural conditions”? If not, should we provide additional guidance or examples about what
events would be covered? Should we clarify that what is considered “severe weather” in one
region may differ from another region? For example, high levels of rainfall may be considered
“severe weather” in a typically arid region.
64. Are the proposed requirements for calculating and presenting the financial impact metrics
clear? Should the analysis be performed and disclosed in a manner other than on a line-by-line
basis referring to the line items of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements?
65. We are proposing to allow a registrant to aggregate the absolute value of negative and
positive impacts of all climate-related events and, separately, transition activities on a financial
statement line item. Should we instead require separate quantitative disclosure of the impact of
each climate-related event or transition activity? Should we require separate disclosure of the
impact of climate-related opportunities that a registrant chooses to disclose?
66. The proposed financial impact metrics would not require disclosure if the absolute value
of the total impact is less than one percent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year. Is the
proposed threshold appropriate? Should we use a different percentage threshold (e.g., three
131
percent, five percent) or use a dollar threshold (e.g., less than or greater than $1 million)?
Should we use a combination of a percentage threshold and a dollar threshold? Should we only
require disclosure when the financial impact exceeds the threshold, as proposed, or should we
also require a determination of whether an impact that falls below the proposed quantitative
threshold would be material and should be disclosed?
67. For purposes of determining whether the disclosure threshold has been met, should
impacts on a line item from climate-related events and transition activities be permitted to offset
(netting of positive and negative impacts), instead of aggregating on an absolute value basis as
proposed? Should we prescribe how to analyze positive and negative impacts on a line item
resulting from the same climate-related event or the same transition activity (e.g., whether or not
netting is permitted at an event or activity level)? Should we permit registrants to determine
whether or not to offset as a policy decision (netting of the positive and negative impact within
an event or activity) and provide relevant contextual information? Should we require the
disclosure threshold to be calculated separately for the climate-related events and transition
activities, rather than requiring all of the impacts to be aggregated as proposed?
68. Instead of including a quantitative threshold, as proposed, should we require
disaggregated disclosure of any impact of climate-related risks on a particular line item of the
registrant’s consolidated financial statements? Alternatively, should we just use a materiality
standard?
69. Should we require a registrant to disclose changes to the cost of capital resulting from the
climate-related events? If so, should we require a registrant to disclose its weighted average cost
of capital or any internal cost of capital metrics? Would such disclosure elicit decision-useful or
material information for investors?
132
70. We have not proposed defining the term “upstream costs” as used in the proposed
examples for the financial impact metrics and elsewhere. Should we define that term or any
others? If so, how should we define them?
71. Are the proposed examples in the financial impact metrics helpful for understanding the
types of disclosure that would be required? Should we provide different or additional examples
or guidance?
3. Expenditure Metrics
The proposed expenditure metrics would refer to the positive and negative impacts
associated with the same climate-related events, transition activities, and identified climaterelated risks as the proposed financial impact metrics.366
 As proposed, the expenditure metrics
would require a registrant to separately aggregate amounts of (i) expenditure expensed and (ii)
capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented.
367
 For each of those categories, a
registrant would be required to disclose separately the amount incurred during the fiscal years
presented (i) toward positive and negative impacts associated with the climate-related events
(i.e., severe weather events and other natural conditions and identified physical risks) and (ii)
toward transition activities, specifically, to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate
exposure to transition risks (including identified transition risks).
368
 The registrant may also
choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate-related opportunities associated with
transition activities.
369
 As discussed above, if a registrant elects to disclose the impact of an
366 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(e), (f), and (i).
367 See id. These metrics are focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s). We
therefore believe the number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of
income statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements.
368 See id.
369 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(j).
133
opportunity, it must do so consistently and must follow the same presentation and disclosure
threshold requirements applicable to the required disclosures of expenditure metrics associated
with transition risks. The amount of expenditure disclosed pursuant to the proposed metrics
would be a portion, if not all, of the registrant’s total recorded expenditure (expensed or
capitalized), as calculated pursuant to the accounting principles applicable to the registrant’s
financial statements.370

The proposed expenditure metrics would be subject to the same disclosure threshold as
the financial impact metrics, which we believe would promote comparability, consistency, and
clarity in determining when information must be disclosed. For purposes of calculating the
disclosure threshold for the expenditure metrics, a registrant would be permitted to separately
determine the amount of expenditure expensed and the amount of expenditure capitalized;
however, a registrant would be required to aggregate expenditure related to climate-related
events and transition activities within the categories of expenditure (i.e., amount capitalized and
amount expensed). This approach should better reflect the significance of climate-related
expenditure compared to a calculation approach that would allow for a disclosure threshold to be
measured at the individual event or activity level, which may result in more limited disclosures.
For example, assume a registrant capitalized $200,000 of expenditure incurred related to
Event D and capitalized another $100,000 of expenditure incurred related to Activity E. The
registrant also expensed $25,000 of expenditure incurred related to Event F (which is an
identified transition risk disclosed by the registrant). The registrant would determine whether the
370 See 17 CFR 210.4-01(a)(1) and (2).
134
impacts would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the proposed thresholds, as
illustrated below:
Expenditure
category
Current fiscal
year balances
(from
consolidated
financial
statements)*
Event D Activity E Event F Percentage
impact
Capitalized
costs (total
expenditure
incurred during
the year that
was capitalized)
$8,000,000 $200,000 $100,000 3.85%**
Expense (total
expenditure
incurred during
the year that
was expensed)
$3,000,000 $25,000 0.8%
*As expenditures capitalized and expensed are recorded in various financial statement line items, we expect the
“total” to be used for disclosure threshold calculation purposes for each category to represent the aggregated
expenditures capitalized during the fiscal year and aggregated expenditures expensed during the fiscal year. See
below for additional discussion regarding associated contextual information that may be required.
**Calculated based on total impact on capitalized costs from Event D ($200,000), Activity E ($100,000), and
Event F ($0): $300,000/$8,000,000.
In the above example, the expenditure incurred toward Event D was $200,000
(capitalized) and the expenditure incurred toward Activity E and Event F were $100,000
(capitalized) and $25,000 (expensed). The amount of capitalized costs equaled the proposed one
percent threshold, and thus the disclosure would be required for that category of expenditure. No
disclosure would be required for the expenditure incurred that was expensed (related to Event F
in this example), because it was below the one percent threshold. The registrant’s resulting
disclosure of such expenditure (capitalized or expensed) may be provided, for example, as
illustrated in the following table (excluding disclosure of contextual information):
Note X. Climate-related financial metrics:
Expenditure incurred for climaterelated events
Expenditure incurred for
climate-related transition activities
Capitalized costs $200,000 $100,000
135
In this example, contextual information may include disclosure such as the specific
climate-related events and transition activities that were aggregated for purposes of determining
the impacts on the capitalized or expensed expenditure amounts and, if applicable, policy
decisions made by a registrant to determine the amount of climate-related events or transition
activities that are categorized as expenditure capitalized versus expenditure expensed or whether
impact from pursuing any climate-related opportunities are included in the analysis. Contextual
information may also include a discussion of the composition of the total expenditure expensed
and total expenditure capitalized, which were used to calculate whether the disclosure threshold
was met, and, if applicable, a discussion of the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the
amount of impact between the climate-related events, transition activities, and other factors,
including if an event or an activity impacted both capitalized and expensed costs.
The proposed rules would clarify that a registrant may be required to disclose the amount
of expenditure expensed or capitalized costs, as applicable, incurred for the climate-related
events to increase the resilience of assets or operations, retire or shorten the estimated useful
lives of impacted assets, relocate assets or operations at risk, or otherwise reduce the future
impact of severe weather events and other natural conditions on business operations.
371
 The
proposed rules would also clarify that a registrant may be required to disclose the amount of
expenditure expensed or capitalized costs, as applicable, incurred for climate-related transition
activities related to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets,
infrastructure, or products that are intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy
efficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy credits), or improve other resource efficiency.372

371 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(e).
372 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(f).
136
Several commenters recommended taking a similar approach, stating that we should
require disclosure of climate-related capital expenditure (i.e., capitalized assets),373 or both
climate-related expenses and capitalized assets.374
 Consistent with these comments, and for
similar reasons to those stated above with respect to the financial impact metrics, separate
disclosure of total expense and total capitalized costs incurred toward the climate-related events
and transition activities should provide important information to help investors make better
informed investment or voting decisions. Moreover, the financial impacts of expenditure
typically appear in different places within the financial statements (e.g., in an asset line item(s)
on the balance sheet or in an expense line item(s) in the income statement). The proposed
approach is intended to address this dispersed presentation by requiring registrants to first
identify the relevant climate-related expenditures and then compile those impacts in one location.
Similar to the proposed financial impact metrics, such an approach should provide insight into,
and context for understanding, the nature of a registrant’s business, including any disclosed
strategy for addressing and managing the specified risks—particularly in the context of transition
planning.375
Request for Comment
72. Should we require registrants to disclose the expenditure metrics, as proposed? Would
presenting the expenditure metrics separately in one location provide decision-useful information

Defense Council.
374 See, e.g., letters from Calvert; Climate Risk Disclosure Lab; and World Benchmarking Alliance.
375 See supra Section II.C, which discusses our proposals to require the registrant to describe the actual and
potential impacts of the identified climate-related risks (and climate-related opportunities if the registrant elects
to do so) on its strategy, business model, and outlook. Further, such disclosure could also provide additional
context to other narrative disclosures such as the discussion of risk factors required by 17 CFR 229.105.
137
to investors? Is there a different type of metric that would result in more useful disclosure of the
expense or capitalized costs incurred toward climate-related events and transition activities or
toward climate-related risks more generally?
73. Would the disclosure required by the expenditure metrics overlap with the disclosure
required by the financial impact metrics? If so, should we require the disclosure to be provided
pursuant to only one of these types of metrics?
74. Should the same climate-related events (including severe weather events and other
natural conditions and identified physical risks) and transition activities (including identified
transition risks) that we are proposing to use for the financial impact metrics apply to the
expenditure metrics, as proposed? Alternatively, should we not require a registrant to disclose
expenditure incurred towards identified climate-related risks and only require disclosure of
expenditure relating to severe weather events and other natural conditions? Should we require a
registrant to disclose the expenditure incurred toward only certain examples of severe weather
events and other natural conditions? If so, should we specify which severe weather events and
other natural conditions the registrant must include? Would requiring disclosure of the
expenditure relating to a smaller subset of climate-related risks be easier for a registrant to
quantify without sacrificing information that would be material to investors?
75. Should the proposed rules instead require a registrant to disclose the aggregate amounts
of expensed and capitalized costs incurred toward any climate-related risks? Should
expenditures incurred towards climate-related opportunities be optional based on a registrant’s
election to disclose such opportunities, as proposed?
76. Should we apply the same disclosure threshold to the expenditure metrics and the
financial impact metrics? Is the proposed threshold for expenditure metrics appropriate? Should
138
we use a different percentage threshold (e.g., three percent, five percent) or use a dollar threshold
(e.g., less than or greater than $1 million)? Should we use a combination of a percentage
threshold and a dollar threshold? Should we only require disclosure when the amount of
climate-related expenditure exceeds the threshold, as proposed, or should we also require a
determination of whether an amount of expenditure that falls below the proposed quantitative
threshold would be material and should be disclosed? Should we require separate aggregation of
the amount of expense and capitalized costs for purposes of the threshold, as proposed? Should
we require separate aggregation of expenditure relating to the climate-related events and
transition activities, as proposed?
77. Instead of including a quantitative threshold, as proposed, should we require
disaggregated disclosure of any amount of expense and capitalized costs incurred toward the
climate-related events and transition activities, during the periods presented? Alternatively,
should we just use a materiality standard?
78. Are the proposed requirements for calculating and presenting the expenditure metrics
clear? Should the analysis be performed and disclosed in a different manner, other than
separately based on capitalized costs and amount of expenditure expensed and separately based
on the climate-related events and transition activities? Should disclosure of expenditure incurred
be required for both the amount of capitalized costs and the amount of expenditure expensed if
only one of the two types of expenditure meets the disclosure threshold? Should we require
separate disclosure of expenditure incurred toward each climate-related event and transition
activity?
79. The proposed rule does not specifically address expensed or capitalized costs that are
partially incurred towards the climate-related events and transition activities (e.g., the
139
expenditure relates to research and development expenses that are meant to address both the risks
associated with the climate-related events and other risks). Should we prescribe a particular
approach to disclosure in such situations? Should we require a registrant to provide a reasonable
estimate of the amount of expense or capitalized costs incurred toward the climate-related events
and transition activities and to provide disclosure about the assumptions and information that
resulted in the estimate?
80. Are the proposed terms and examples used in the expenditure metrics helpful for
understanding the types of disclosures that would be required? Should we provide different or
additional examples?
4. Financial Estimates and Assumptions
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and
assumptions used to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures
to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, climate-related events
(including identified physical risks and severe weather events and other natural conditions), such
as flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, sea level rise.
376
 If so, the registrant would
be required to provide a qualitative description of how such events have impacted the
development of the estimates and assumptions used by the registrant in the preparation of such
financial statements. Similar to the other proposed financial statement metrics, the proposed
rules would include a provision that would require separate disclosure focused on transition
activities (including identified transition risks).
377
 Further, if a registrant elects to disclose the
impact of an opportunity on its financial estimates and assumptions, it must do so consistently
376 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(g) and (i).
377 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(h) and (i).
140
and must follow the same presentation and disclosure requirements applicable to the required
disclosures herein.
378

If the estimates and assumptions a registrant used to produce the consolidated financial
statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a
potential transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate-related targets it has disclosed, the
registrant would be required to provide a qualitative description of how the development of the
estimates and assumptions were impacted by such a potential transition or the registrant’s
disclosed climate-related targets.
Estimates and assumptions are currently required for accounting and financial reporting
purposes (e.g., projected financial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss
contingencies, estimated credit risks, commodity price assumptions, etc.). The proposed
disclosures could provide decision-useful information and transparency to investors about the
impact of the climate-related events and transition activities, including disclosed targets and
goals,379 on such estimates and assumptions. Moreover, in addition to providing insight into
impacts on the registrant’s financial statements, such disclosure could allow investors to evaluate
the reasonableness of the registrant’s estimates and assumptions, which are used to prepare the
registrant’s financial statements. Although current accounting standards require registrants to
consider how climate-related matters may intersect with and affect the financial statements,
378 See proposed 17 CFR 210.14-02(j).
379 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506.
141
including their impact on estimates and assumptions,
380 the nature of the climate-related events
and transition activities discussed in the proposed rules, which may manifest over a longer time
horizon, necessitate targeted disclosure requirements to elicit decision-useful information for
investors in a consistent manner. We also note that some registrants have already provided
disclosure along the lines of the proposed requirements, which lends support to the feasibility of
making such disclosures.
381
By way of example, the proposed climate-related events and impacts relating to a
transition away from greenhouse gas producing products and activities could affect a registrant’s
asset values and may result in asset impairments. The effect on asset values and the resulting
impairments could, in turn, affect a registrant’s assumptions when calculating depreciation
expenses or asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible, long-lived
assets. Providing related disclosure could help an investor understand if a registrant would be
responsible for removing equipment or cleaning up hazardous materials sooner than originally
planned due to a severe weather event. Similarly, a registrant’s climate-related targets and
related commitments, such as a commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, may impact
certain accounting estimates and assumptions. For example, if a registrant announced a
380 See FASB Staff Educational Paper, Intersection of Environmental, Social and Governance Matters with
Financial Accounting Standards (Mar. 2021), available at
https://fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage&cid=1176176379917. See also IFRS, Effects of
climate-related matters on financial statements (Nov. 2020), available at

20explicitly%20to%20climate-related,significant%20judgements%20and%20estimates%20that%20
management%20has%20made. We also remind registrants of the requirements under FASB ASC Topic 250-
10-50-4 for disclosures of changes in accounting estimates, including the requirement that if a change in
estimate does not have a material effect in the period of change, but is reasonably certain to have a material
effect in later periods, a description of that change in estimate must be disclosed whenever the financial
statements of the period of change are presented.
381 See letter from Carbon Tracker (stating that some companies in the European Union and United Kingdom
(several of which are registrants) are already providing this information and providing examples).
142
commitment that would require decommissioning an asset by a target year, then the registrant’s
depreciation expense should reflect alignment with that commitment. If the registrant believes it
can execute a strategy that would allow it to meet the commitment and continue to operate the
asset past the target date, then the proposed disclosure requirement could facilitate an investor’s
understanding and own assessment of the feasibility of that strategy. Other financial statement
estimates and assumptions that may require disclosure pursuant to the proposed rules may
include those related to the estimated salvage value of certain assets, estimated useful life of
certain assets, projected financial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss
contingencies, estimated reserves (such as environmental reserve or loan loss allowances),
estimated credit risks, fair value measurement of certain assets, and commodity price
assumptions.
Several commenters stated that it was important to provide investors with an
understanding of how climate-related events and activities are considered when a registrant
develops the assumptions and estimates used to prepare its financial statements.382
 In particular,
one commenter stated that investors may face “substantial risk” if disclosure on the impact of
“decarbonization” on the estimates and assumptions underlying asset valuations is not
disclosed.383 Another commenter stated that “current corporate disclosure is not sufficient, is not
readily available in existing financial disclosures, and does not allow investors to make
comparable assessments of how companies are evaluating and responding to climate-related
risks and opportunities.”384

materially impacted by the climate-related events and transition activities?
83. Should we instead require disclosure of financial estimates and assumptions impacts by a
subset of climate-related events and transition activities, such as not requiring disclosure related
to identified climate-related risks or only requiring disclosure with respect to a subset of severe
weather events and natural conditions? If so, how should the subset be defined?
84. Should we instead utilize terminology and thresholds consistent with the critical
accounting estimate disclosure requirement in 17 CFR 229.303(b)(3), such as “estimates made in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of
estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the
financial condition or results of operations of the registrant”? If so, should we only require
disclosures of whether and how the climate-related events and transition activities impacted such
critical accounting estimates? Should we require only a qualitative description of how the
estimates and assumptions were impacted by the climate-related events and transition activities,
as proposed? Should we require quantitative disclosures as well? If so, should we require such
disclosure only if practicable or subject to another qualifier?
144
85. Should the disclosure of financial estimates and assumptions impacted by climate-related
opportunities be optional, as proposed?
86. For the proposed financial statement metrics, should we require a registrant to disclose
material changes in estimates, assumptions, or methodology among fiscal years and the reasons
for those changes? If so, should we require the material changes disclosure to occur on a
quarterly, or some other, basis? Should we require disclosure beyond a discussion of the
material changes in assumptions or methodology and the reasons for those changes? Do existing
required disclosures already elicit such information? What other approaches should we
consider?
5. Inclusion of Climate-Related Metrics in the Financial Statements
The proposed financial statement metrics would be required in the financial statements,
and therefore would be (i) included in the scope of any required audit of the financial statements
in the relevant disclosure filing, (ii) subject to audit by an independent registered public
accounting firm, and (iii) within the scope of the registrant’s ICFR.
As discussed above, the proposed disclosures share many characteristics with other
complex financial statement disclosures. The financial statement metrics present financial data
that is derived from the registrant’s consolidated balance sheets, income statements, and
statements of cash flows, and would be presented in a similar way to existing financial statement
disclosures.
385
 Requiring certain climate-related information to be included in a note to the
financial statements, and therefore subject to audit and within the scope of ICFR, should enhance
the reliability of the proposed financial statement metrics.
385 See supra Section II.F.2 for additional discussion of shared characteristics that the financial statement metrics
have with existing financial statement disclosures and commenters’ views.
145
Request for Comment
87. We are proposing to require the financial statement metrics to be disclosed in a note to
the registrant’s audited financial statements. Should we require or permit the proposed financial
statement metrics to be disclosed in a schedule to the financial statements? If so, should the
metrics be disclosed in a schedule to the financial statements, similar to the schedules required
under Article 12 of Regulation S-X, which would subject the disclosure to audit and ICFR
requirements? Should we instead require the metrics to be disclosed as supplemental financial
information, similar to the disclosure requirements under FASB ASC Topic 932-235-50-2 for
registrants that have significant oil- and gas-producing activities? If so, should such
supplemental schedule be subject to assurance or ICFR requirements?
88. Instead of requiring the financial statement metrics to be disclosed in a note to the
registrant’s audited financial statements, should we require a new financial statement for such
metrics? For example, should a “consolidated climate statement” be created in addition to the
consolidated balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income, cash flows, and other
traditional financial statements? Would including the proposed metrics in a new financial
statement provide more clarity to investors given that the metrics are intended to follow the
structure of the existing financial statements (including the line items)? What complications or
unintended consequences may arise in practice if such a climate statement is created?
89. Should we require the disclosure to be provided outside of the financial statements?
Should we require all of the disclosure to be provided in the proposed separately captioned item
in the specified forms?
90. Should we require any additional metrics or disclosure to be included in the financial
statements and subject to the auditing and ICFR requirements as described above? For example,
146
should any of the disclosures we are proposing to require outside of the financial statements
(such as GHG emissions metrics) be included in the financial statements? If so, should such
metrics be disclosed in a note or a schedule to the financial statements? If in a schedule, should
such schedule be similar to the schedules required under Article 12 of Regulation S-X and
subject to audit and ICFR requirements? Should we instead require the metrics to be disclosed
as supplemental financial information in a supplemental schedule? If so, should such
supplemental schedule be subject to assurance or ICFR requirements?
91. Under the proposed rules, PCAOB auditing standards would be applicable to the
financial statement metrics that are included in the audited financial statements, consistent with
the rest of the audited financial statements. What, if any, additional guidance or revisions to
such standards would be needed in order to apply PCAOB auditing standards to the proposed
financial statement metrics? For example, would guidance on how to apply existing
requirements, such as materiality, risk assessment, or reporting, be needed? Would revisions to
the auditing standards be necessary? What additional guidance or revisions would be helpful to
auditors, preparers, audit committee members, investors, and other relevant participants in the
audit and financial reporting process?
92. Would it be clear that the climate-related financial statement metrics would be included
in the scope of the audit when the registrant files financial statements prepared in accordance
with IFRS as issued by the IASB? Would it be clear that the proposed rules would not alter the
basis of presentation of the financial statements as referred to in an auditor’s report? Should we
amend Form 20-F, other forms, or our rules to clarify the scope of the audit or the basis of
presentation in this context? For example, should we amend Form 20-F to state specifically that
the scope of the audit must include any notes prepared pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation S-X?
147
What are the costs for accounting firms to provide assurance with respect to the financial
statement metrics? Would those costs decrease over time?
G. GHG Emissions Metrics Disclosure
1. GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement
a. Overview
In addition to the other proposed climate-related disclosures, the proposed rules would
require a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year.386

As institutional investors and other commenters have indicated, GHG emissions information is
important to investment decisions for various reasons, including because GHG emissions data is
quantifiable and comparable across industries and can be particularly useful in conducting a
transition risk analysis;387 it can be used to evaluate the progress in meeting net-zero
commitments and assessing any associated risks;388 and it may be relevant to investment or
voting decisions because GHG emissions could impact the company’s access to financing, as
well as its ability to reduce its carbon footprint in the face of regulatory, policy, and market
constraints.389
 Thus, while the justifications for the proposed GHG emissions disclosures
overlap in some respects with the justifications for the other proposed climate-related disclosure
rules, the GHG emissions requirements are intended to address separate challenges and are
supported by the particular justifications discussed in detail in the following sections.
386 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a). As discussed below, the proposed rules would also require a registrant to
disclose its GHG emissions for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements.
387 See, e.g., infra note 432 and accompanying text.
388 See, e.g., infra, note 433 and accompanying text.
389 See, e.g., infra note 455 and accompanying text.
148
The proposed rules would establish certain requirements regarding the measurement and
reporting of GHG emissions that would promote the comparability of such disclosure. We have
based the proposed GHG emissions disclosure rules on the concept of scopes, which are
themselves based on the concepts of direct and indirect emissions, developed by the GHG
Protocol. We also have proposed definitions of Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions that are
substantially similar to the corresponding definitions provided by the GHG Protocol.
Commenters indicated that the GHG Protocol has become the leading accounting and reporting
standard for GHG emissions.
390 By sharing certain basic concepts and a common vocabulary
with the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules should help limit the compliance burden for those
registrants that are already disclosing their GHG emissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol.391

Similarly, to the extent that registrants elect to follow GHG Protocol standards and
methodologies, investors already familiar with the GHG Protocol may also benefit.
The proposed rules would define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO2”); methane
(“CH4”); nitrous oxide (“N2O”); nitrogen trifluoride (“NF3”); hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”);
perfluorocarbons (“PFCs”); and sulfur hexafluoride (“SF6”).392
 The greenhouse gases included
in the proposed definition reflect the gases that are currently commonly referenced by
international, scientific, and regulatory authorities as having significant climate impacts. In
390 See supra note 112 and accompanying text.
391 In addition, as discussed in Section II.G.2.d, the proposed rules would permit a registrant, if actual reported data
is not reasonably available, to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter,
together with actual, determined GHG emissions data for the first three fiscal quarters, as long as the registrant
promptly discloses in a subsequent filing any material difference between the estimate used and the actual,
determined GHG emissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter. See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4)(i). This
proposed provision should also help mitigate the GHG emissions compliance burden for registrants.
392 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(g).
149
addition to being consistent with the GHG Protocol,393 the list of constituent greenhouse gases
would be consistent with the gases identified by widely used frameworks, such as the Kyoto
Protocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, and the EPA.394

The proposed rules would define GHG emissions to mean direct and indirect emissions
of greenhouse gases.395
 Pursuant to the proposed definition of GHG emissions, direct emissions
are GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a registrant,
396 whereas indirect
emissions are GHG emissions that result from the activities of the registrant, but occur at sources
not owned or controlled by the registrant.
397
 Similar to the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules
would define:398
393 In Feb. 2013 the GHG Protocol amended the required greenhouse gas inventory list to align with the seven
gases required by the Kyoto Protocol (consistent with the proposed definition of greenhouse gases). See GHG
Protocol, Required Greenhouse Gases in Inventories: Accounting and Reporting Standard Amendment (Feb.
2013), available at https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/NF3-Amendment_052213.pdf.
Nevertheless, the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which was updated in 2015,
continues to refer to only six greenhouse gases. We believe the common understanding of the GHG Protocol’s
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard is that the earlier amendment (reflecting seven gases) applies
despite the subsequent 2015 update to the standard.
394 See UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”) – Reporting requirements (last visited Nov.
4, 2021), available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/reporting-and-reviewunder-the-convention/greenhouse-gas-inventories-annex-i-parties/reporting-requirements. The Kyoto Protocol
is the international agreement linked to the UNFCCC. See also U.S. Energy Information Administration –
Where greenhouse gases come from (last updated May 21, 2021), available at
https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/energy-and-the-environment/where-greenhouse-gases-come-from.php;
and EPA – Overview of Greenhouse Gases (last visited Nov. 4, 2021), available at
https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases.
395 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(h).
396 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(h)(1).
397 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(h)(2).
398 Sources of emissions can include transportation, electricity production, industrial processes, commercial and
residential use, agriculture, and land use changes (including deforestation). See, e.g., EPA, Sources of
Greenhouse Gas Emissions, available at https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gasemissions. ).
150
• Scope 1 emissions as direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned or controlled
by a registrant;399
• Scope 2 emissions as indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or
acquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or
controlled by a registrant;
400 and
• Scope 3 emissions as all indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a registrant’s
Scope 2 emissions, which occur in the upstream and downstream activities of a
registrant’s value chain.401 Upstream emissions include emissions attributable to goods
and services that the registrant acquires, the transportation of goods (for example, to the
registrant), and employee business travel and commuting. Downstream emissions
include the use of the registrant’s products, transportation of products (for example, to the
registrant’s customers), end of life treatment of sold products, and investments made by
the registrant.
As previously noted, the EPA uses the concept of scopes, and refers to the GHG Protocol,
when providing guidance to companies regarding their GHG emissions inventories.402
 Because
GHG emissions data compiled for the EPA’s own GHG emissions reporting program would be
consistent with the GHG Protocol’s standards, and thus with the proposed rules, a registrant may
use that data in partial fulfillment of its GHG emissions disclosure obligations pursuant to the
proposed rules.
399 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(p).
400 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(q).
401 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(r).
402 See supra note 113. The EPA requires the disclosure of direct GHG emissions primarily from large industrial
sources as well as emissions from fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites in the United States.
See EPA, Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, available at https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting.
151
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose its total Scope 1 emissions
separately from its total Scope 2 emissions after calculating them from all sources that are
included in the registrant’s organizational and operational boundaries.403
 A registrant would also
be required to disclose separately its total Scope 3 emissions for the fiscal year if those emissions
are material, or if it has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3
emissions.
404
 For each of its Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, the proposed rules would require a
registrant to disclose the emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas (e.g.,
by carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)) and in the
aggregate.405
 By requiring the disclosure of GHG emissions both disaggregated by the
constituent greenhouse gases and in the aggregate, investors could gain decision-useful
information regarding the relative risks to the registrant posed by each constituent greenhouse
gas in addition to the risks posed by its total GHG emissions by scope. For example, if a
government targets reduction of a specific greenhouse gas, knowing that a registrant has
significant emissions of such gas would provide insight into potential impacts on the registrant’s
business.406 Because measuring the constituent greenhouse gases is a necessary step in
403 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(1). We discuss the setting of a registrant’s organizational and operational
boundaries in Section II.G.2. below.
404 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1). As discussed in greater detail below, for many companies, these
emissions may be material for assessing the companies’ exposure to climate-related risks, particularly transition
risks, and their strategy to reduce their carbon footprint in the face of regulatory, policy, and market constraints.
See infra Section II.G.1.b.
405 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a)(1).
406 For example, the White House has recently launched an initiative to reduce methane emissions in the United
States. See the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, U.S. Methane Emissions Reductions Action
Plan (Nov. 2021), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-MethaneEmissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-1.pdf.
152
calculating a registrant’s total GHG emissions per scope, the proposed disaggregation by each
constituent greenhouse gas should not create significant additional burdens.
Consistent with the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules would require a registrant to
express each scope of its GHG emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”).
407

CO2e is the common unit of measurement used by the GHG Protocol to indicate the global
warming potential (“GWP”)408 of each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the GWP of one
unit of carbon dioxide (CO2).409
 Requiring a standard unit of measurement for GHG emissions,
rather than different units of measurement for the different greenhouse gases, should simplify the
disclosure for investors and enhance its comparability across registrants with different types of
GHG emissions.
For all scopes of GHG emissions, the proposed rules would require a registrant to
disclose GHG emissions data in gross terms, excluding any use of purchased or generated
offsets.410
 Because the value of offsets can vary depending on restrictions that are or may be
imposed by regulation or market conditions, disclosing GHG emissions data in this manner
would allow investors to assess the full magnitude of climate-related risk posed by a registrant’s
GHG emissions and the registrant’s plans for managing such risk. This proposed approach also
is consistent with the approach taken by the GHG Protocol.411

407 See id.
408 The proposed rules would define global warming potential to mean a factor describing the global warming
impacts of different greenhouse gases. It is a measure of how much energy will be absorbed in the atmosphere
over a specified period of time as a result of the emission of one ton of a greenhouse gas, relative to the
emissions of one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(f).
409 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(d).
410 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a)(2). The proposed rules would define carbon offsets to represent an
emissions reduction or removal of greenhouse gases in a manner calculated and traced for the purpose of
offsetting an entity’s GHG emissions. See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(a).
411 See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 9.
153
Commenters generally supported requiring disclosure of a registrant’s Scope 1 and Scope
2 emissions, with many also supporting disclosure of Scope 3 emissions.412 A common reason
asserted by commenters for requiring GHG emissions disclosure is that quantitative data, such as
GHG emissions data, is useful for assessing a registrant’s exposure to climate-related risks and
accordingly its ability to transition to a lower carbon economy.

using GHG emissions data do so because the data provides insight into a registrant’s exposure to
climate-related risks, and transition risks in particular—risks that have implications for a
registrant’s financial condition and results of operations.414
 An increasing number of investors
have identified GHG emissions as material to their investment decision-making and are either
purchasing this information from third-party providers or engaging with companies to obtain the
information directly. In each situation, there is a lack of consistency, comparability, and
reliability in those data that our proposal seeks to address.
415
Some of these commenters supported requiring disclosure of Scope 1 emissions at the
individual greenhouse gas level.416 Although commenters noted an increase in the voluntary
reporting of climate-related disclosure, several also stated that significant gaps remain in the
414 See, e.g., letters from Bloomberg, LP (stating that GHG emissions are critical components of any climaterelated financial disclosure scheme, and that understanding the emissions contributions of a company is an
important factor for understanding how financially vulnerable they may be to shifts in regulation, technology,
and markets during any transition to a lower-carbon economy); CalPers (indicating the use of GHG emissions
data by asset managers to evaluate potential transition risks); and Credit Suisse (supporting mandatory
disclosure of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions for key industries as such information is critical for financial market
participants to have a better understanding of their total climate-related exposure to the highest emitting
sectors).
415 See, e.g., letters from CALSTRS (indicating the use by asset managers of third-party derived climate data, the
expense and lack of consistency regarding such data, and the need for publicly available climate data so that the
commenter may more efficiently and cost-effectively allocate capital to lower climate risk assets in line with its
investment objectives); Credit Suisse (stating that the lack of consistent and reliable climate-related data has
created significant challenges in the ability of financial market participants to adequately assess and compare
the performance of reporting companies, as well as efficiently allocate capital towards low-carbon solutions);
and Norges Bank Investment Management (indicating their reliance on companies’ climate-related data to
assess their exposure to the effects of climate and how they manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and
stating that the scope and quality of companies’ climate-related disclosures varies significantly and that their
climate-related data is often incomplete and/or not comparable).

ICCR.

disclosure, particularly regarding Scope 3 emissions, which, for certain industries, can comprise
a majority of GHG emissions.417
Many commenters recommended basing any GHG emissions disclosure requirement on
the GHG Protocol.418
 Several of these commenters stated that the GHG Protocol’s framework
for reporting GHG emissions, delineated as Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, has become the
globally-accepted standard used by numerous companies for reporting their GHG emissions.419
Commenters also indicated that a mandatory standard for reporting GHG emissions based on the
GHG Protocol would help in producing consistent, comparable, and reliable climate-related
information for investors.420
 Some commenters also stated that mandating GHG emissions
pursuant to a standardized approach, such as the GHG Protocol, would help mitigate instances of
greenwashing.421
417 See, e.g., letters from Ceres (“In land-intensive sectors, deforestation, forest degradation, and land-use change
are important financial risks associated with climate change. In these sectors—for example food and forest
management—currently Scope 3 GHG emissions are not regularly disclosed, despite comprising upwards of
90% of emissions from companies.”); see also letters from Apple (stating that Scope 3 emissions “represent the
overwhelming majority of most companies’ carbon footprint and are therefore critical to include”); Natural
Resources Defense Council; NY State Comptroller; and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of
America.

Advisors. See also Section IV.C below for further discussion of the practice of greenwashing.
156
Some commenters indicated that the Commission should mandate disclosure of only
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.422
 Other commenters suggested limiting the mandatory disclosure of
Scope 3 emissions to registrants in certain industries,423 larger registrants, or when a registrant’s
Scope 3 emissions comprise 40 percent of its total emissions.424
 These commenters pointed to
difficulties in obtaining the necessary data from third parties and methodological uncertainties as
reasons for limiting or not requiring disclosure of Scope 3 emissions. Other commenters and
research support a requirement for disclosure of Scope 3 emissions that is independent of an
individual company’s materiality assessment.425
A few commenters stated that the Commission should require the disclosure of only
Scope 1 emissions.426
 One commenter stated that this approach would be consistent with the
Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program overseen by the EPA, which they stated requires the
tracking of facility-level Scope 1 emissions from “large greenhouse gas emitters.”

commenter opposed a requirement to disclose any GHG emissions, asserting that GHG
emissions do not serve as adequate indicators for the actual risks faced by a registrant.428
We agree with the many commenters that indicated that GHG emissions disclosure could
provide important information for investors to help them evaluate the climate-related risks faced
by registrants and to understand better how registrants are planning to mitigate or adapt to those
risks.429
 The proposed GHG emissions disclosures could be important to an investor’s
understanding of other disclosures that would be required by the proposed rules, such as
disclosure of the likely impacts of climate-related risks as well as any targets and goals
disclosure.430

We propose requiring disclosure of registrants’ Scopes 1 and 2 emissions because, as
several institutional investor commenters stated, investors need and many investors currently use
this information to make investment or voting decisions.431
 One of those commenters stated that
GHG emissions information serves as the starting point for transition risk analysis because it is
quantifiable and comparable across companies and industries.432
 The commenter, an
institutional investor, indicated that it uses GHG emissions data to rank companies within
industries based on their GHG emissions intensity to better assess transition risk exposure of
companies in its portfolio and make informed investment decisions. This commenter also

Management Co.
432 See Wellington Management Co.
158
indicated that Scopes 1 and 2 emissions information is more broadly available than Scope 3
emissions data because of the challenges of collecting the latter data.
As previously mentioned, several large institutional investors and financial institutions,
which collectively have trillions of dollars in assets under management, have formed initiatives
and made commitments to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050, with interim targets set for
2030.433
 These initiatives further support the notion that investors currently need and use GHG
emissions data to make informed investment decisions. These investors and financial institutions
are working to reduce the GHG emissions of companies in their portfolios or of their
counterparties and need GHG emissions data to evaluate the progress made regarding their netzero commitments and to assess any associated potential asset devaluation or loan default
risks.434
 A company’s GHG emissions footprint also may be relevant to investment or voting
decisions because it could impact the company’s access to financing or signal potential changes
in its financial planning as governments, financial institutions, and other investors make demands
to reduce GHG emissions.
We also agree with commenters that basing the Commission’s proposed GHG emissions
disclosure rules on concepts used in the GHG Protocol could help provide investors with
consistent, comparable, and reliable information about a registrant’s GHG emissions.435
 In this
regard, we note that several studies have found that GHG emissions data prepared pursuant to the
433 See supra Section I.C.1 (discussing, in particular, Climate Action 100+ and GFANZ).
434 See, e.g., Climate Action 100+, The Three Asks.
435
 See supra note 420.

GHG Protocol have become the most commonly referenced measurements of a company’s
exposure to climate-related risks.436

However, we are not proposing to adopt all of the features of the GHG Protocol into the
Commission’s proposed climate-related disclosure rules. As explained in greater detail below, in
one significant respect the proposed rules differ from the approach taken by the GHG Protocol
regarding the methodology that a registrant would be required to use when calculating its GHG
emissions. This difference better suits the U.S. financial reporting regime and the needs of
investors.437
 We recognize that the methodologies pertaining to the measurement of GHG
emissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions, are evolving. While we expect that many registrants
would choose to follow the standards and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol when
calculating their GHG emissions, the proposed rules would not require registrants to do so.
Allowing for some flexibility in the choice of GHG emissions methodologies would permit
registrants to adapt to new approaches, such as those pertaining to their specific industry, as they
emerge.
b. The Treatment of Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Compared to Scope 3
Emissions
We are proposing to require all registrants to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.
Those types of emissions result directly or indirectly from facilities owned or activities
controlled by a registrant. The relevant data for calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions should be
436 See, e.g., Kauffmann, C., C. Tébar Less and D. Teichmann (2012), Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emission
Reporting: A Stocktaking of Government Schemes, OECD Working Papers on International Investment,
2012/01, OECD Publishing, at 8, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k97g3x674lq-en (“For example, the
use of scope 1, 2, 3 to classify emissions as defined by the GHG Protocol has become common language and
practice today.”).
437 See infra Section II.G.2 (discussing the proposed treatment for determining ownership or control for the
purpose of setting a registrant’s organizational boundaries when measuring its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions).
160
reasonably available to registrants, and the relevant methodologies are fairly well-developed.
Registrants with large stationary sources of emissions already report Scope 1 emissions data to
the EPA, and the EPA provides detailed methodologies for a range of industries with significant
Scope 1 emissions.438
 The EPA also provides detailed guidance for the calculation of Scope 2
emissions, which, although classified as “indirect emissions,” are generated by direct activities of
the registrant in using purchased energy.439
Unlike Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, Scope 3 emissions typically result from the activities of
third parties in a registrant’s value chain440 and thus collecting the appropriate data and
calculating these emissions would potentially be more difficult than for Scopes 1 and 2
emissions. At the same time, in many cases Scope 3 emissions disclosure may be necessary to
present investors a complete picture of the climate-related risks̶—particularly transition risks̶—
that a registrant faces and how GHG emissions from sources in its value chain, which are not
included in its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, may materially impact a registrant’s business
operations and associated financial performance. Scope 3 emissions can augment the
information provided in Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and help to reflect the total emissions
associated with a registrant’s operations, including inputs from upstream activities, such as those
438 See EPA, Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources (Dec. 2020), available at
https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/documents/stationaryemissions.pdf.
439 See EPA, Indirect Emissions from Purchased Electricity (Dec. 2020), available at
https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/documents/electricityemissions.pdf.
440 As previously mentioned, the proposed rules would define a registrant’s value chain to mean the upstream and
downstream activities related to a registrant’s operations. Upstream activities include activities that relate to the
initial stages of producing a good or service (e.g., materials sourcing, materials processing, and supplier
activities). Downstream activities include activities that relate to processing materials into a finished product
and delivering it or providing a service to the end user (e.g., transportation and distribution, processing of sold
products, use of sold products, end of life treatment of sold products, and investments). See proposed 17 CFR
229.1500(t).
161
of its suppliers, and outputs from downstream activities, such as those involving the distribution,
use, and disposal of a registrant’s products or services.441

Scope 3 emissions are indirect, but registrants can and do take steps to limit Scope 3
emissions and the attendant risks. Although a registrant may not own or control the operational
activities in its value chain that produce Scope 3 emissions, it nevertheless may influence those
activities, for example, by working with its suppliers and downstream distributors to take steps to
reduce those entities’ Scopes 1 and 2 emissions (and thus help reduce the registrant’s Scope 3
emissions) and any attendant risks. As such, a registrant may be able to mitigate the challenges
of collecting the data required for Scope 3 disclosure.442
 Such data may reveal changes in a
registrant’s Scope 3 emissions over time that could be informative for investors in discerning
how the registrant is managing transition risks. For example, a registrant could seek to reduce
the potential impacts on its business of its upstream emissions by choosing to purchase from
more GHG emission-efficient suppliers or by working with existing suppliers to reduce
emissions. A registrant could also seek to reduce the potential impacts on its business of
downstream emissions by producing products that are more energy efficient or involve less GHG
emissions when consumers use them, or by contracting with distributors that use shorter
transportation routes. Being able to compare Scope 3 emissions over time could thus be a
valuable tool for investors in tracking a registrant’s progress in mitigating transition and other
climate-related risks.
441 See, e.g., letter from Wellington Management Co.
442 See, e.g., letter from Apple (referencing its 2021 Environmental Progress Report, available at
https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2021.pdf, which states that
109 suppliers across 24 countries have committed to manufacturing Apple products with 100 percent renewable
energy, and indicating Apple’s development of detailed life cycle assessment models, which help the company
identify its top product component contributors of carbon emissions and facilitate its providing a comprehensive
account of its relevant Scope 3 emissions).
162
To balance the importance of Scope 3 emissions with the potential relative difficulty in
data collection and measurement, the proposed rules would require disclosure of Scope 3
emissions only if those emissions are material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions
reduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions.
443
 As explained in greater detail
below, this latter proposed disclosure requirement could assist investors in tracking the progress
of the registrant toward reaching the target or goal so that investors can better understand
potential associated costs.444

Consistent with the Commission’s definition of “material” and Supreme Court precedent,
a registrant would be required to disclose its Scope 3 emissions if there is a substantial likelihood
that a reasonable investor would consider them important when making an investment or voting
decision.
445 In articulating this materiality standard, the Supreme Court recognized that “[d]oubts
as to the critical nature” of the relevant information “will be commonplace.” But “particularly in
view of the prophylactic purpose” of the securities laws,” and “the fact that the content” of the
disclosure “is within management’s control, it is appropriate that these doubts be resolved in
favor of those the statute is designed to protect,” namely investors.446
When recommending that the Commission require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions,
some commenters indicated that Scope 3 emissions represent the relatively large source of
overall GHG emissions for many companies.
447
 Given their relative magnitude, we agree that,
443 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1). As explained below, we are also proposing a safe harbor for Scope 3
disclosures. See infra Section II.G.3.
444 See infra note 461 and accompanying text.
445 See supra note 209.

 TSC Industries, Inc. v Northway, 426 U.S. at 448.
447 See, e.g., letters from Apple; and WK Associates.
163
for many registrants, Scope 3 emissions may be material to help investors assess the registrants’
exposure to climate-related risks, particularly transition risks,448 and whether they have
developed a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint in the face of regulatory, policy, and market
constraints.449
Scope 3 emissions information may be material in a number of situations to help
investors gain a more complete picture of the transition risks to which a registrant may be
exposed. In certain industries, a transition to lower-emission products or processes may already
be underway, triggered by existing laws or regulations, changes in weather, policy initiatives, a
shift in consumer preferences, technological changes, or other market forces, such that financial
risks are reasonably foreseeable for registrants in those industries based on the emissions in their
value chain. For example, some registrants may need to allocate capital to invest in lower
emissions equipment. Investors thus need and use information about the full GHG emissions
footprint and intensity of a registrant to determine and compare how exposed a registrant is to the
financial risks associated with any transition to lower-emission products.
For example, in the automobile industry, the vast majority of car manufacturers’ GHG
emissions footprint comes from tailpipe emissions of cars driven by customers, as compared to
448 See, e.g., letter from Wellington Management Co.
449 See Eric Rosenbaum, Climate experts are worried about the toughest carbon emissions for companies to
capture (Aug. 18, 2021) (“Scope 3 carbon emissions, or those not part of operations or under direct control,
represent the majority of the carbon footprint for most companies, in some cases as high as 85% to 95%”),

also MSCI, Emissions: Seeing the Full Picture (Sept. 17, 2020) (“For some companies and industries, Scope 3
emissions dominate the overall carbon footprint. For example, the Scope 3 emissions of the integrated oil and

emissions from oil products and 60-85% of those from natural gas, according to the International Energy
Agency).

the emissions from manufacturing the cars.450
 There is already a transition underway to reduce
tailpipe emissions through the adoption of stricter fuel efficiency regulations451 and by
governmental initiatives that encourage the manufacture and demand for electric vehicles.
452

Demand for electric vehicles is increasing in the United States and globally,
453 and leading
automobile manufacturers have announced plans to increase the manufacture of electric vehicles,
with many setting commitments to manufacture all-electric fleets or achieve net-zero
emissions.454 This transition raises financial risks for automobile manufacturers, which can be
gauged, in part, by their Scope 3 emissions. Investors can use Scope 3 emissions data
concerning a car manufacturer’s suppliers and the use of its sold products to assess whether a

particular manufacturer is taking steps to mitigate or adapt to the risks posed by a transition to
lower emission vehicles.
Changes in requirements by financial institutions and institutional investors can present
similar financial risks for companies. As many financial institutions and investors begin to set
their own GHG emissions reduction goals, they may consider the total GHG emissions footprint
of companies that they finance or invest in to build portfolios to meet their goals.455
 Financial
institutions and investors may focus on Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for companies in some
industries, particularly for industries in which Scopes 1 and 2 represent the majority of
companies’ total GHG emissions footprint. For other industries, however, Scope 3 emissions
represent a relatively significant portion of companies’ total GHG footprint, and therefore may
reflect a more complete picture of companies’ exposure to transition risks than Scopes 1 and 2
emissions alone. For oil and gas product manufacturers, for example, Scope 3 emissions are
likely to be material and thus necessary to an understanding of a registrant’s climate-related
risks.
When assessing the materiality of Scope 3 emissions, registrants should consider whether
Scope 3 emissions make up a relatively significant portion of their overall GHG emissions.
While we are not proposing a quantitative threshold for determining materiality, we note that
some companies rely on, or support reliance on, a quantitative threshold such as 40 percent when
assessing the materiality of Scope 3 emissions.456
 However, even when Scope 3 emissions do
not represent a relatively significant portion of overall GHG emissions, a quantitative analysis
455 See supra Section I.C.1.
456 See, e.g., letter from Uber Technologies; see also TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans,
at note 40, citing SBTi, SBTi Criteria and Recommendations (Oct. 2021), available at
https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/SBTi-criteria.pdf.
166
alone would not suffice for purposes of determining whether Scope 3 emissions are material.
Consistent with the concept of materiality in the securities laws, this determination would
ultimately need to take into account the total mix of information available to investors, including
an assessment of qualitative factors. Accordingly, Scope 3 emissions may make up a relatively
small portion of a registrant’s overall GHG emissions but still be material where Scope 3
represents a significant risk, is subject to significant regulatory focus, or “if there is a substantial
likelihood that a reasonable [investor] would consider it important.” 457
 Moreover, if a
materiality analysis requires a determination of future impacts, i.e., a transition risk yet to be
realized, then both the probability of an event occurring and its magnitude should be considered.
Even if the probability of an adverse consequence is relatively low, if the magnitude of loss or
liability is high, then the information in question may still be material.
If a registrant determines that its Scope 3 emissions are not material, and therefore not
subject to disclosure, it may be useful to investors to understand the basis for that determination.
Further, if a registrant determines that certain categories of Scope 3 emissions are material,
registrants should consider disclosing why other categories are not material. If, however, Scope
3 emissions are material, then understanding the extent of a registrant’s exposure to Scope 3
emissions, and the choices it makes regarding them, would be important for investors when
making investment or voting decisions.
Several commenters stated that disclosure of a registrant’s Scope 3 emissions is essential
to making an informed investment decision because Scope 3 emissions can indicate a registrant’s
457 TSC Industries v. Northway, 426 U.S. at 449.
167
exposure to climate-related transition risks.458 For example, if policy changes lead to mandatory
emissions reductions or carbon pricing, a registrant with high Scope 3 emissions could
experience higher costs in sourcing key inputs. Similarly, if consumer preferences change to
favor products that are less carbon intensive, a registrant could see a significant change in
demand for its products. Registrants that do not account for these risks, or make suboptimal
choices regarding them, could become less profitable in the future than registrants that
acknowledge these risks and successfully mitigate them.459 Thus, Scope 3 emissions disclosure
could help convey to investors the potential financial risks facing a company related to any
transition to a lower carbon economy. With Scope 3 information disclosed, investors would be
able to assess, in conjunction with reported financial information, how GHG emissions impact
the registrant’s operations as well as its overall business strategy so that they can make more
informed investment or voting decisions.460
Disclosure of Scope 3 emissions could also highlight instances where a registrant
attempts to reduce its total Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by outsourcing carbon intensive activities.
For example, a registrant could contract out certain high-emissions production activities so that
its own Scope 1 or 2 emissions are lower than a similar company that has retained direct
ownership and control over more of its production activities. Thus, Scope 3 emissions reporting
458 See, e.g., letters from Confluence Philanthropy; Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment; Mirova US
LLC; NY City Comptroller; and Wellington Management Co.
459 See id.
460 For example, registrants that choose to mitigate climate-related risks by undertaking research and development
activities to source inputs involving less GHG emissions might incur expenses in the short-term but could
achieve potential long-term cost savings by implementing more energy-efficient production processes and
avoiding potential penalties imposed by regulation.
168
could provide greater transparency and help preclude any efforts by registrants to obscure for
investors the full magnitude of the climate-related risks associated with their GHG emissions.
The proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3 emissions if it
has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes Scope 3 emissions.461
 This
disclosure requirement would enable investors to understand the scale and scope of actions the
registrant may need to take to fulfill its commitment to reduce its Scope 3 emissions and the
potential financial impact of that commitment on the registrant. It would also enable an investor
to assess the registrant’s strategy for meeting its Scope 3 emissions target or goal and its progress
towards that target or goal, which may affect the registrant’s business.
Scope 3 emissions disclosures would help investors to understand and assess the
registrant’s strategy. For example, Scope 3 emissions disclosures would allow an investor to
better understand how feasible it would be for the registrant to achieve its targets through its
current strategy, to track the registrant’s progress over time, and to understand changes the
registrant may make to its strategy, targets, or goals. Scope 3 emissions disclosures would thus
be important to evaluating the financial effects of the registrant’s target or goal. In addition, this
disclosure could help prevent instances of greenwashing or other misleading claims concerning
the potential impact of Scope 3 emissions on a registrant’s business because investors, and the
market would have access to a quantifiable, trackable metric.
A registrant’s Scope 3 emissions disclosure, together with the proposed financial
statement metrics, would also enable an investor to assess the efficiency and efficacy of the
registrant’s actions to achieve its target or goal (e.g., by comparing the registrant’s expenditures
461 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1).
169
or other investments in lower carbon transition activities from year to year with any
corresponding reduction in its Scope 3 emissions). If a registrant has a relatively ambitious
Scope 3 emissions target, but discloses little investment in transition activities in its financial
statements and little or no reduction in Scope 3 emissions from year to year, these disclosures
could indicate to investors that the registrant may need to make a large expenditure or significant
change to its business operations as it gets closer to its target date, or risk missing its
target. Both potential outcomes could have financial ramifications for the registrant and,
accordingly, investors.
The proposed disclosure requirement should also give investors the ability to evaluate
whether a registrant’s target or goal and its plan for achieving that target or goal could have an
adverse impact on the registrant. For example, an investor might conclude that the financial
costs of a registrant’s plan would outweigh any benefits to the business, and factor that into how
the registrant’s securities fit into the investor’s own investment portfolio given the investor’s risk
tolerance and other investment goals. Thus, the objective of this disclosure is not to drive
targets, goals, plans, or conduct, but to provide investors with the tools to assess the implications
of any targets, goals, or plans on the registrant in making investment or voting decisions.
This disclosure requirement could also enable investors to better compare firms. For
example, two registrants may have the same total GHG emissions and have made the same
commitments to reduce total GHG emissions from Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions combined.
However, if the registrants have different proportions of emissions from Scope 1 and 2 versus
Scope 3, investors might determine that there would be different costs and effects for these
registrants from their disclosed plans to reduce their overall emissions.
170
Scope 3 emissions disclosures could also enable investors to better compare registrants’
plans to achieve their Scope 3 emissions targets or goals. For example, registrants in the retail
industry may have a relatively large portion of their Scope 3 emissions derived from customer
travel to the registrant’s stores and shipping products or goods to customers or stores. If a
registrant in this industry has set Scope 3 emissions targets or goals, in order to meet those
targets or goals it may choose to relocate its stores to be closer to public transportation. Another
similarly situated registrant may elect to switch to using electric vehicles for shipping. A third
similarly situated registrant might elect to take neither action, but instead assume Scope 3
emissions reductions based on customers’ change in behavior. Investors could assess the
likelihood of each of these three registrants meeting their Scope 3 emissions target or goal—as
well as the likely financial and operational impact—which could depend on the amount and type
of their Scope 3 emissions. Investors could also compare the potential impacts of these plans on
the three different registrants. Without disclosures of the amount and type of Scope 3 emissions,
investors would face difficulty assessing the likely impacts of a target or goal that includes Scope
3 emissions on registrants and comparing the relative impacts across registrants.
If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would be required to identify the
categories of upstream and downstream activities that have been included in the calculation of its
Scope 3 emissions. Consistent with the GHG Protocol,462 the proposed rules identify several
categories of activities that can give rise to Scope 3 emissions. Upstream activities from which
Scope 3 emissions might result include:
• A registrant’s purchased goods and services;
462 See WBCSD and World Resources Institute, Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3)
Accounting and Reporting Standard (Sept. 2011).
171
• A registrant’s capital goods;
• A registrant’s fuel and energy related activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2
emissions;
• Transportation and distribution of purchased goods, raw materials, and other inputs;
• Waste generated in a registrant’s operations;
• Business travel by a registrant’s employees;
• Employee commuting by a registrant’s employees; and
• A registrant’s leased assets related principally to purchased or acquired goods or
services.463
Downstream activities from which Scope 3 emissions might result include:
• Transportation and distribution of a registrant’s sold products, goods or other outputs;
• Processing by a third party of a registrant’s sold products;
• Use by a third party of a registrant’s sold products;
• End-of-life treatment by a third party of a registrant’s sold products;
• A registrant’s leased assets related principally to the sale or disposition of goods or
services;
• A registrant’s franchises; and
• Investments by a registrant.464

The list of upstream and downstream activities set forth in proposed Item 1500(r) is nonexclusive. If any upstream or downstream activities were significant to the registrant when
463 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(r).
464 See id. The “investments” category would capture what are commonly referred to as “financed emissions.”
172
calculating its Scope 3 emissions, the proposed rules would require it to identify such categories
and separately disclose Scope 3 emissions data for each of those categories together with a total
of all Scope 3 emissions.465
 For example, an energy company that produces oil and gas products
may find that a significant category of activity resulting in Scope 3 emissions relates to the end
use of its sold products. A manufacturer might find that a significant category of activities
resulting in Scope 3 emissions relate to the emissions of its suppliers in the production of
purchased goods or services, the processing of its sold products, or by the fuel consumed by its
third-party transporters and distributors of those goods and services and of its sold products. In
some cases, the category in which an emissions source belongs may be unclear, or the source
might fit within more than one category. In those cases, registrants would need to use their best
judgment as to the description of the emissions source and provide sufficient transparency as to
the reasoning and methodology to facilitate investor understanding of the emissions category and
source.
If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would also be required to describe
the data sources used to calculate those emissions, including the use of any of the following:
• Emissions reported by parties in the registrant’s value chain, and whether such reports
were verified by the registrant or a third party, or unverified;
• Data concerning specific activities,466 as reported by parties in the registrant’s value
chain; and
465 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(1).
466 Activity data refers to a quantitative measure of a level of activity that results in GHG emissions. Depending on
the activity, such data could be expressed, for example, as: liters of fuel consumed; kilowatt-hours of electricity
consumed; kilograms of material consumed; kilometers of distance traveled; hours of time operated; square
meters of area occupied; kilograms of waste generated; kilograms of product sold; or quantity of money spent.
See GHG Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 7.
173
• Data derived from economic studies, published databases, government statistics, industry
associations, or other third-party sources outside of a registrant’s value chain, including
industry averages of emissions, activities, or economic data.467
This information is intended to assist investors in assessing the reliability and accuracy of
the registrant’s Scope 3 emissions disclosure. For example, an investor might find emissions data
related to the downstream transportation and distribution of a registrant’s sold products more
reliable if based on specific distances traveled by the registrant’s transportation and distribution
partners and company-specific emissions factors rather than estimates of distances traveled based
on industry-average data and using national average emission factors. Although we recognize that
a registrant may sometimes need to use industry- and national-average data when calculating its
Scope 3 emissions, information about the data sources for its Scope 3 emissions would help
investors better understand the risk exposure posed by the registrant’s value chain in comparison
with other registrants and make more informed investment decisions.
We acknowledge that a registrant’s material Scope 3 emissions is a relatively new type of
metric, based largely on third-party data, that we have not previously required. We are
proposing the disclosure of this metric because we believe capital markets have begun to assign
financial value to this type of metric, such that it can be material information for investors about
financial risks facing a company. Scope 3 emissions disclosure is an integral part of both the
TCFD468 framework and the GHG Protocol,
469 which are widely accepted. It also has been
widely recognized that, for some companies, disclosure of just Scopes 1 and 2 emissions could
467 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2).
468 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 1.
469 See, e.g., GHG Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
174
convey an incomplete, and potentially misleading, picture.470
 We have attempted to calibrate our
proposal to balance investors’ demand for this information with the current limitations of the
Scope 3 emissions data.
We also recognize, as discussed below, that the reporting of Scope 3 emissions may
present more challenges than the reporting of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. But in light of the fact
that a GHG emissions reporting regime may be incomplete without the reporting of Scope 3
emissions, we are proposing to include them, with an appropriate transition period and safe
harbor, at the outset. Although we have not proposed to exclude specific upstream or downstream
activities from the scope of the proposed Scope 3 disclosure requirement, we have limited the
proposed disclosure requirement to those value chain emissions that overall are material. We also
have not proposed a bright-line quantitative threshold for the materiality determination as
suggested by some commenters471 because whether Scope 3 emissions are material would depend
on the particular facts and circumstances, making it difficult to establish a “one size fits all”
standard.
Request for Comment
93. How would investors use GHG emissions disclosures to inform their investment and
voting decisions? How would such disclosures provide insight into a registrant’s financial
condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations? How would such
disclosures help investors evaluate an issuer’s climate risk-related exposure? Would such
470 See, e.g., TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021), Appendix 1; and letters from
Apple; NY City Comptroller; and Wellington Investment Co.
471 See, e.g., letter from Catavento Consultancy (stating that Scope 3 emissions disclosure should be mandatory for
larger companies and for those in which Scope 3 emissions account for more than 40% of total emissions).
175
disclosures enable investors to better assess physical risks associated with climate-related events,
transition risks, or both types of risks?
94. Should we require a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions both in the aggregate, per
scope, and on a disaggregated basis for each type of greenhouse gas that is included in the
Commission’s proposed definition of “greenhouse gases,” as proposed? Should we instead
require that a registrant disclose on a disaggregated basis only certain greenhouse gases, such as
methane (CH4) or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), or only those greenhouse gases that are the most
significant to the registrant? Should we require disaggregated disclosure of one or more
constituent greenhouse gases only if a registrant is obligated to separately report the individual
gases pursuant to another reporting regime, such as the EPA’s greenhouse gas reporting regime
or any foreign reporting regime? If so, should we specify the reporting regime that would trigger
this disclosure?
95. We have proposed defining “greenhouse gases” as a list of specific gases that aligns with
the GHG Protocol and the list used by the EPA and other organizations. Should other gases be
included in the definition? Should we expand the definition to include any other gases to the
extent scientific data establishes a similar impact on climate change with reasonable certainty?
Should we require a different standard to be met for other greenhouse gases to be included in the
definition?
96. Should we require a registrant to express its emissions data in CO2e, as proposed? If not,
is there another common unit of measurement that we should use? Is it important to designate a
common unit of measurement for GHG emissions data, as proposed, or should we permit
registrants to select and disclose their own unit of measurement?
176
97. Should we require a registrant to disclose its total Scope 1 emissions and total Scope 2
emissions separately for its most recently completed fiscal year, as proposed? Are there other
approaches that we should consider?
98. Should we require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3 emissions for the fiscal year if
material, as proposed? Should we instead require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions for all
registrants, regardless of materiality? Should we use a quantitative threshold, such as a
percentage of total GHG emissions (e.g., 25%, 40%, 50%) to require the disclosure of Scope 3
emissions? If so, is there any data supporting the use of a particular percentage threshold?
Should we require registrants in particular industries, for which Scope 3 emissions are a high
percentage of total GHG emissions, to disclose Scope 3 emissions?
99. Should we require a registrant that has made a GHG emissions reduction commitment
that includes Scope 3 emissions to disclose its Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Should we
instead require registrants that have made any GHG emissions reduction commitments, even if
those commitments do not extend to Scope 3, to disclose their Scope 3 emissions? Should we
only require Scope 3 emissions disclosure if a registrant has made a GHG emissions reduction
commitment that includes Scope 3 emissions?
100. Should Scope 3 emissions disclosure be voluntary? Should we require Scope 3
emissions disclosure in stages, e.g., requiring qualitative disclosure of a registrant’s significant
categories of upstream and downstream activities that generate Scope 3 emissions upon
effectiveness of the proposed rules, and requiring quantitative disclosure of a registrant’s Scope 3
emissions at a later date? If so, when should we require quantitative disclosure of a registrant’s
Scope 3 emissions?
177
101. Should we require a registrant to exclude any use of purchased or generated offsets
when disclosing its Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Should we require a
registrant to disclose both a total amount with, and a total amount without, the use of offsets for
each scope of emissions?
102. Should we require a registrant to disclose its Scope 3 emissions for each separate
significant category of upstream and downstream emissions as well as a total amount of Scope 3
emissions for the fiscal year, as proposed? Should we only require the disclosure of the total
amount of Scope 3 emissions for the fiscal year? Should we require the separate disclosure of
Scope 3 emissions only for certain categories of emissions and, if so, for which categories?
103. Should the proposed rules include a different standard for requiring identification of the
categories of upstream and downstream emissions, such as if those categories of emissions are
significant to total GHG emissions or total Scope 3 emissions? Are there any other categories of,
or ways to categorize, upstream or downstream emissions that a registrant should consider as a
source of Scope 3 emissions? For example, should we require a registrant to disclose Scope 3
emissions only for categories of upstream or downstream activities over which it has influence or
indirect control, or for which it can quantify emissions with reasonable reliability? Are there any
proposed categories of upstream or downstream emissions that we should exclude as sources of
Scope 3 emissions?
104. Should we, as proposed, allow a registrant to provide their own categories of upstream
or downstream activities? Are there additional categories, other than the examples we have
identified, that may be significant to a registrant’s Scope 3 emissions and that should be listed in
the proposed rule? Are there any categories that we should preclude, e.g., because of lack of
accepted methodologies or availability of data? Would it be useful to allow registrants to add
178
categories that are particularly significant to them or their industry, such as Scope 3 emissions
from land use change, which is not currently included in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 3
categories? Should we specifically add an upstream emissions disclosure category for land use?
105. Should we require the calculation of a registrant’s Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3
emissions to be as of its fiscal year end, as proposed? Should we instead allow a registrant to
provide its GHG emissions disclosures according to a different timeline than the timeline for its
Exchange Act annual report? If so, what should that timeline be? For example, should we allow
a registrant to calculate its Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 emissions for a 12-month period
ending on the latest practicable date in its fiscal year that is no earlier than three months or,
alternatively, six months prior to the end of its fiscal year? Would allowing for an earlier
calculation date alleviate burdens on a registrant without compromising the value of the
disclosure? Should we allow such an earlier calculation date only for a registrant’s Scope 3
emissions? Would the fiscal year end calculations required for a registrant to determine if Scope
3 emissions are material eliminate the benefits of an earlier calculation date? Should we instead
require a registrant to provide its GHG emissions disclosures for its most recently completed
fiscal year one, two, or three months after the due date for its Exchange Act annual report in an
amendment to that report?
106. Should we require a registrant that is required to disclose its Scope 3 emissions to
describe the data sources used to calculate the Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Should we
require the proposed description to include the use of: (i) emissions reported by parties in the
registrant’s value chain, and whether such reports were verified or unverified; (ii) data
concerning specific activities, as reported by parties in the registrant’s value chain; and (iii) data
derived from economic studies, published databases, government statistics, industry associations,
179
or other third-party sources outside of a registrant’s value chain, including industry averages of
emissions, activities, or economic data, as proposed? Are there other sources of data for Scope 3
emissions the use of which we should specifically require to be disclosed? For purposes of our
disclosure requirement, should we exclude or prohibit the use of any of the proposed specified
data sources when calculating Scope 3 emissions and, if so, which ones?
107. Should we require a registrant to provide location data for its disclosed sources of Scope
1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions if feasible? If so, should the feasibility of providing location
data depend on whether it is known or reasonably available pursuant to the Commission’s
existing rules (Securities Act Rule 409 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21)? Would requiring
location data, to the extent feasible, assist investors in understanding climate-related risks, and in
particular, likely physical risks, associated with a registrant’s emissions’ sources? Would a
requirement to disclose such location data be duplicative of any of the other disclosure
requirements that we are proposing?
108. If we require a registrant to provide location data for its GHG emissions, how should
that data be presented? Should the emissions data be grouped by zip code separately for each
scope? Should the disclosure be presented in a cartographic data display, such as what is
commonly known as a “heat map”? If we require a registrant to provide location data for its
GHG emissions, should we also require additional disclosure about the source of the emissions?
c. GHG Intensity
In addition to requiring the disclosure of its GHG emissions in gross terms, the proposed
rules would also require a registrant to disclose the sum of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in terms
180
of GHG intensity.472
 If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would also be
required to separately disclose its Scope 3 emissions in terms of GHG intensity.473
 GHG
intensity disclosure should provide context to a registrant’s emissions in relation to its business
scale (e.g., emissions per economic output). For example, car manufacturer A may generate
more emissions in terms of CO2e than car manufacturer B; however, when analyzing an intensity
metric (emissions per unit of production), it becomes apparent that car manufacturer A actually
has a lower emission rate per car produced than car manufacturer B, which indicates a
registrant’s emission efficiency. Because emission efficiency can be a potential indicator of the
likelihood of the registrant being impacted by transition risks, such GHG intensity disclosure
could provide decision-useful information to investors. In addition, the proposed GHG intensity
disclosure would provide a standardized method for presenting such measure of efficiency across
registrants, which should facilitate comparability of the registrant’s emissions efficiency over
time.
The proposed rules would define “GHG intensity” (or “carbon intensity”) to mean a ratio
that expresses the impact of GHG emissions per unit of economic value (e.g., metric tons of
CO2e per unit of total revenues, using the registrant’s reporting currency) or per unit of
production (e.g., metric tons of CO2e per unit of product produced).474
 For purposes of
standardizing the disclosure and facilitating its comparability, we are proposing to require the
disclosure of GHG intensity in terms of metric tons of CO2e per unit of total revenue and per unit
472 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(1).
473 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(2). The proposed safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure would apply
to this proposed GHG intensity metric for Scope 3 emissions. See infra Section II.C.3.
474 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(i). We derived this proposed definition from the GHG Protocol. See GHG
Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 9.
181
of production for the fiscal year.
475
 Total revenue is one of the most commonly used and
understood financial metrics when investors analyze a registrant’s financial results and applies to
most registrants (depending on the nature and maturity of the business) and therefore would be a
good common denominator for the intensity calculation. The selected unit of production should
be relevant to the registrant’s industry to facilitate investor comparison of the GHG intensity of
companies within an industry without regard to registrant size. Investors may find such a
comparison to be useful to making informed investment decisions to the extent that a registrant
within a particular industry that has a lower GHG intensity relative to its peers that face fewer
climate-related risks.
If the registrant has no revenue for a fiscal year, it would be required to calculate its GHG
intensity with another financial measure (e.g., total assets), with an explanation of why the
particular measure was used. Similarly, if the registrant does not have a unit of production, it
would be required to calculate its GHG intensity with another measure of economic output,
depending on the nature of its business (e.g., data processing capacity, volume of products sold,
or number of occupied rooms) with an explanation of why the particular measure was used.476

A registrant could also voluntarily disclose other additional measures of GHG intensity,
including non-financial measures such as economic output, provided it includes an explanation
of the reasons why those particular GHG intensity measures were used and why the registrant
believes such measures provide useful information to investors.477
 In all cases, the registrant
475 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(1).
476 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(3).
477 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(d)(4).
182
would be required to disclose the methodology and other information required pursuant to the
proposed GHG emissions metrics instructions.478

Request for Comment
109. Should we require a registrant to disclose the intensity of its GHG emissions for the
fiscal year, with separate calculations for (i) the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and, if
applicable (ii) its Scope 3 emissions (separately from Scopes 1 and 2), as proposed? Should we
define GHG intensity, as proposed? Is there a different definition we should use for this
purpose?
110. Should we require the disclosed GHG intensity to be expressed in terms of metric tons
of CO2e per unit of total revenue, as proposed? Should we require a different financial measure
of GHG intensity and, if so, which measure? For example, should GHG intensity be expressed
in terms of metric tons of CO2e per unit of total assets?
111. Should we require the disclosed GHG intensity to be expressed in terms of metric tons
of CO2e per unit of production, as proposed? Would such a requirement facilitate the
comparability of the disclosure? Should we require a different economic output measure of
GHG intensity and, if so, which measure? For example, should GHG intensity be expressed in
terms of metric tons of CO2e per number of employees? Should we require the GHG intensity to
be expressed per unit of production relevant to the registrant’s business (rather than its industry)?
Is further guidance needed on how to comply with the proposed requirement? Would requiring
GHG intensity to be expressed in terms of metrics tons of CO2e per unit of production require
disclosure of commercially sensitive or competitively harmful information?
478 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1) and infra Section II.G.2 for the proposed disclosure requirements
pertaining to GHG emissions methodology.
183
112. Should we require a registrant with no revenue or unit of production for a fiscal year to
disclose its GHG intensity based on, respectively, another financial measure or measure of
economic output, as proposed? Should we require such a registrant to use a particular financial
measure, such as total assets, or a particular measure of economic output, such as total number of
employees? For registrants who may have minimal revenue, would the proposed calculation
result in intensity disclosure that is confusing or not material? Should additional guidance be
provided with respect to such instances?
113. Should we permit a registrant to disclose other measures of GHG intensity, in addition
to the required measures, as long as the registrant explains why it uses the particular measure of
GHG intensity and discloses the corresponding calculation methodology used, as proposed?
d. GHG Emissions Data for Historical Periods
The proposed rules would require disclosure to be provided for the registrant’s most
recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in the registrant’s
consolidated financial statements in the applicable filing, to the extent such historical GHG
emissions data is reasonably available.479
 Requiring historical GHG emissions data, to the extent
available, would provide useful information for investors by enabling investors to track over time
the registrant’s exposure to climate-related impacts represented by the yearly emissions data, and
to assess how it is managing the climate-related risks associated with those impacts. Requiring
GHG emissions disclosure for current and, when reasonably available, historical periods should
enable investors to analyze trends in the impacts of material climate-related risks and to evaluate
the narrative disclosure provided pursuant to proposed Item 1502.480 Historical GHG emissions
479 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(a).
480 See supra Section II.C for a discussion of proposed 17 CFR 229.1502.
184
data also could be particularly useful when a registrant has announced a target or goal for
reducing GHG emissions by a certain date by helping investors assess its progress in meeting
that target or goal and the related impacts on the registrant.
Linking the required number of years of historical GHG emissions data to the historical
periods required in the consolidated financial statements should benefit investors by requiring
emissions data that is consistent with the financial statement metrics in the filing. This should
help investors connect GHG emissions with the financial performance of a registrant in the same
period, including the proposed financial statement metrics. Moreover, although we are not
proposing to require the GHG emissions data to be included in the registrant’s consolidated
financial statements, we nevertheless believe that the GHG emissions data is relevant to, and
would be read in conjunction with, information included in the consolidated financial statements.
Just as data about a registrant’s revenues and expenses on its income statement reflect its
activities in financial terms for a given year, a registrant’s emissions data reflect its carbon
footprint activities for that year. For this reason, we have proposed requiring a registrant to
provide its GHG emissions data for the same number of years as it is required to provide data on
its income statement and cash flow statement, to the extent such emissions data is reasonably
available. For example, a registrant that is required to include income statements and cash flow
statements at the end of its three most recent fiscal years would be required to disclose three
years of its Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if material to the registrant or if it has set a GHG emissions
target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions, its Scope 3 emissions, expressed both in
185
absolute terms and in terms of intensity.
481
 If the registrant is a SRC, only two years of Scopes 1
and 2 emissions metrics would be required.482
A registrant, however, would not otherwise be required to provide a corresponding GHG
emissions metric for a fiscal year preceding its current reporting fiscal year if, for example, it
was not required to and has not previously presented such metric for such fiscal year and the
historical information necessary to calculate or estimate such metric is not reasonably available
to the registrant without unreasonable effort or expense.483

Request for Comment
114. Should we require GHG emissions disclosure for the registrant’s most recently
completed fiscal year and for the appropriate, corresponding historical fiscal years included
in the registrant’s consolidated financial statements in the filing, to the extent such historical
GHG emissions data is reasonably available, as proposed? Should we instead only require
GHG emissions metrics for the most recently completed fiscal year presented in the relevant
filing? Would requiring historical GHG emissions metrics provide important or material
information to investors, such as information allowing them to analyze trends?
2. GHG Emissions Methodology and Related Instructions
The proposed rules would require a registrant to describe the methodology, significant
inputs, and significant assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions metrics.484
 As proposed,
the description of the registrant’s methodology must include the registrant’s organizational
481 Alternatively, if a registrant has no revenue, and it decides to calculate GHG intensity using total assets, we
believe it would be appropriate for that registrant to provide its GHG intensity for the same number of years as
are required on its balance sheets (i.e., two years if not a SRC).
482 We are proposing to exempt SRCs from Scope 3 disclosures. See infra Section II.G.3.
483 See Securities Act Rule 409 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21.
484 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).
186
boundaries, operational boundaries, calculation approach, and any calculation tools used to
calculate the registrant’s GHG emissions.485
 Organizational boundaries would be defined to
mean the boundaries that determine the operations owned or controlled by a registrant for the
purpose of calculating its GHG emissions.486
 Operational boundaries would be defined to mean
the boundaries that determine the direct and indirect emissions associated with the business
operations owned or controlled by a registrant.487
 This information should help investors
understand the scope of a registrant’s operations included in its GHG emissions metrics and how
those metrics were measured. With this information, investors could more knowledgeably
compare a registrant’s GHG emissions metrics with the GHG emissions metrics of other
registrants and make more informed investment decisions.
a. The Setting and Disclosure of Organizational Boundaries
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose its Scope 1 emissions and its
Scope 2 emissions separately after calculating them from all sources that are included in the
registrant’s organizational and operational boundaries.488
 An initial step for many registrants
may be to set their organizational boundaries.489
 Those boundaries determine the business
operations owned or controlled by a registrant to be included in the calculation of its GHG
emissions.490
 Because both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions relate to the operations owned or
485 See id.
486 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(m).
487 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(l).
488 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(1).
489 See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 3.
490 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(m).
187
controlled by a registrant, setting a registrant’s organizational boundaries is an important part of
determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.
Several commenters stated that the GHG Protocol’s standards and guidance would
provide an appropriate framework for reporting GHG emissions if the Commission required
disclosure of GHG emissions.
491
 A company following the GHG Protocol would base its
organizational boundaries on either an equity share approach or a control approach.492
 Our
proposed approach, however, would require a registrant to set the organizational boundaries for
its GHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other
holdings within its business organization as those included in, and based upon the same set of
accounting principles applicable to, its consolidated financial statements.493

For similar reasons to those noted above regarding the proposed time periods required for
GHG emissions disclosure, we propose requiring the scope of consolidation and reporting to be
consistent for financial data and GHG emissions data. This would be accomplished by applying
existing GAAP.494
 Requiring a consistent approach should help avoid potential investor
confusion about the reporting scope used in determining a registrant’s GHG emissions and the
reporting scope used for the financial statement metrics, which are included in the financial
statements. Applying existing GAAP could help limit the compliance burden for registrants as
491 See supra note 111.
492 Under the GHG Protocol’s equity share approach, a company accounts for GHG emissions from operations
according to its share of equity in the operation. Under the GHG Protocol’s control approach, a company
accounts for 100% of the GHG emissions from operations over which it has control. A company can choose to
define control either in financial or operational terms. See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard, Chapter 3.
493 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).
494 Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB would
apply IFRS under the proposed rules as the basis for setting its organizational boundaries for the purpose of
providing the proposed GHG emissions disclosure.
188
they would be able to use familiar concepts from financial reporting when preparing their
required GHG emissions disclosures. Requiring registrants to follow the scope of reporting used
in their financial statements should also enhance comparability across registrants when compared
with the multiple options available under the GHG Protocol.
Thus, as proposed, the scope of reporting for a registrant’s GHG emissions metrics would
be consistent with the scope of reporting for the proposed financial statement metrics and other
financial data included in its consolidated financial statements in order to provide investors a
consistent view of the registrant’s business across its financial and GHG emissions disclosures.
For example, a registrant that prepares its financial statements pursuant to U.S. GAAP would
apply relevant guidance from U.S. GAAP (e.g., FASB ASC Topic 810 Consolidation and FASB
ASC Topic 323 Investments –Equity Method and Joint Ventures) when determining which
entities would be subject to consolidation or which investments qualify for equity method
accounting or proportionate consolidation.495
 Therefore, under the proposed rules a registrant
would be required to include all of the emissions from an entity that it consolidates.496
 For an
equity method investee or an operation that is proportionally consolidated, the registrant would
be required to include its share of emissions based on its percentage ownership of such investee
or operation.497
 For a registrant that applies the equity method to an investee, the percentage of
ownership interest used to record its share of earnings or losses in the investee must be the same
495 Issuers that are permitted to, and do, apply IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board would
apply the IASB’s equivalent standards. See, e.g., IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint
Arrangements and International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 28 Investments in Associates and Joint
Ventures. See supra note 319, which states that foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial
statements under home country GAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP as
the basis for calculating and disclosing the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics. The same
requirement would apply for the purpose of determining the proposed GHG emissions metrics.
496 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).
497 See id.
189
for measuring its share of GHG emissions by the equity method investee.498
 The proposed rules
would permit a registrant to exclude emissions from investments that are not consolidated, are
not proportionately consolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting in
the registrant’s consolidated financial statements.499
For example, a registrant might own or control several plants but have only a minority
ownership in another plant over which it has no control. For the plants that are owned or
controlled by the registrant, all of those plants’ direct and indirect emissions should be included
in its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure (regardless of ownership percentage that resulted in
consolidation for financial statement purposes).500
 If the registrant’s proportional interest in the
latter plant is reflected in its consolidated financial statements (e.g., the investment qualifies for
the equity method or a proportionate consolidation approach), when calculating its Scopes 1 and
2 emissions the registrant should include such proportional share (based on ownership interest)
of that plant’s emissions in the total of each of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.501
A related provision under the proposed rules would require a registrant to use the same
organizational boundaries when calculating its Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions502 since
both sets of emissions relate to operations that a registrant owns or controls. If required to
disclose its Scope 3 emissions, a registrant would also be required to apply the same
organizational boundaries used when determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions as an initial step
498 See id.
499 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(2).
500 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(m) (defining organizational boundaries as the boundaries that determine the
operations owned or controlled by a registrant) and 17 CFR 229.1504(b)(1) (requiring the disclosure of Scopes
1 and 2 emissions separately after calculating them from all sources included in a registrant’s organizational and
operational boundaries).
501 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).
502 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(3).
190
in identifying the sources of indirect emissions from activities in its value chain over which it
lacks ownership and control and which must be included in the calculation of its Scope 3
emissions.503
 Requiring a registrant to use the same organizational boundaries when calculating
its Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions should help limit investor confusion over those operations or
activities over which it has ownership or control (sources of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) and
those activities in its value chain over which it lacks ownership or control (sources of its Scope 3
emissions). The proposed provision also would provide that, once a registrant has determined its
organizational (and operational) boundaries, it must consistently use those boundaries when
calculating its GHG emissions.504
 This proposed provision should help investors track and
compare a registrant’s GHG emissions over time.
b. The Setting and Disclosure of Operational Boundaries
When describing the methodology, significant inputs, and significant assumptions used to
calculate its GHG emissions metrics, a registrant is required to describe its operational
boundaries.505
 This would involve identifying emissions sources within its plants, offices, and
other operational facilities that fall within its organizational boundaries, and then categorizing
the emissions as either direct or indirect emissions. For example, a registrant might have direct
emissions from one or more of the following sources that it owns or controls:
• Stationary equipment (from the combustion of fuels in boilers, furnaces, burners,
turbines, heaters, and incinerators);
503 See id.
504 See id.
505
 See proposed Item 1504(e)(1).
191
• Transportation (from the combustion of fuels in automobiles, trucks, buses, trains,
airplanes, boats, ships, and other vessels);
• Manufacturing processes (from physical or chemical processes, such as CO2 from the
calcination process in cement manufacturing or from catalytic cracking in petrochemical
processing, and PFC emissions from aluminum smelting); and
• Fugitive emission sources (equipment leaks from joints, seals, packing, gaskets, coal
piles, wastewater treatment, pits, cooling towers, and gas processing facilities, and other
unintentional releases).506
Most registrants would likely have emission sources from stationary equipment and
transportation devices. Registrants in certain industrial sectors, such as cement, aluminum, and
other manufacturers, or oil and gas production and refining, are likely also to produce emissions
from physical or chemical processes. Some registrants would likely have emissions from all four
types of sources, particularly if they have their own power generation or waste treatment
facilities.
507
The proposed rules would require a registrant to include its approach to categorizing its
emissions and emissions sources when describing its methodology to determine its operational
boundaries.
508
 A registrant could use the above non-exclusive list of emissions sources or other
categories of emissions sources as long as it describes how it determined the emissions to include
as direct emissions, for the purpose of calculating its Scope 1 emissions, and indirect emissions,
506 This non-exclusive list of possible emissions sources is based on categories of emissions sources provided in the
GHG Protocol. See GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6.
507 See id.
508 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).
192
for the purpose of calculating its Scope 2 emissions.509
 For most registrants, purchased
electricity would likely constitute a large percentage of their Scope 2 emissions. Although Scope
2 emissions are generated from a source external to a registrant, the electricity (or steam, heat, or
cooling) is consumed by the registrant’s operations that it owns or controls.
c. The Selection and Disclosure of a GHG Emissions Calculation
Approach, including Emission Factors
In addition to setting its organizational and operational boundaries, a registrant would
need to select a GHG emissions calculation approach. While the direct measurement of GHG
emissions from a source by monitoring concentration and flow rate is likely to yield the most
accurate calculations, due to the expense of the direct monitoring of emissions, an acceptable and
common method for calculating emissions involves the application of published emission factors
to the total amount of purchased fuel consumed by a particular source.510
 The proposed rules
would define “emission factor” as a multiplication factor allowing actual GHG emissions to be
calculated from available activity data or, if no activity data is available, economic data, to derive
absolute GHG emissions.511
 Emission factors are ratios that typically relate GHG emissions to a
proxy measure of activity at an emissions source. Examples of activity data reflected in emission
factors include kilowatt-hours of electricity used, quantity of fuel used, output of a process, hours
of operation of equipment, distance travelled, and floor area of a building.512
 If no activity data
is available, a registrant may use an emission factor based on economic data.513
 For example,
509 See id.
510 See, e.g., GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6.
511 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1500(e).
512 See id.
513 See id.
193
when calculating Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods or services, a registrant could
determine the economic value of the goods or services purchased and multiply it by an industry
average emission factor (expressed as average emissions per monetary value of goods or
services).514
The EPA has published a set of emission factors based on the particular type of source
(e.g., stationary combustion, mobile combustion, refrigerants, and electrical grid, among others)
and type of fuel consumed (e.g., natural gas, coal or coke, crude oil, and kerosene, among many
others).515
 The GHG Protocol’s own set of GHG emission calculation tools are based in part on
the EPA’s emission factors.516
 Whatever set of emission factors a registrant chooses to use, it
must identify the emission factors and its source.517
After a registrant has selected a calculation approach (i.e., direct measurement or
application of emissions factors), the registrant would determine what data must be collected and
how to conduct the relevant calculations, including whether to use any publicly-available
calculation tools. In this regard, we note that there are a number of publicly-available calculation
514 See, e.g., Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard,
Supplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 1 (describing the
“spend-based method” for calculating emissions from purchased goods or services).
515 See EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Apr. 2021), available at
https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/documents/emission-factors_apr2021.pdf.
516 See, e.g., The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, GHG Emission Calculation Tool (Mar. 2021), available at
https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools.
517 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).
194
tools a registrant may elect to utilize in determining its GHG emissions.518
 Finally, a registrant
would gather and report GHG emissions up to the corporate level.
For example, when determining its Scope 1 emissions for a particular plant, a registrant
might add up the amount of natural gas consumed by furnaces and other stationary equipment
during its most recently completed fiscal year and then apply the CO2 emission factor for natural
gas to that total amount to derive the amount of GHG emissions expressed in CO2e. The
registrant would repeat this process for each type of fuel consumed and for each type of source.
If a registrant owns a fleet of trucks, it might total the amount of diesel fuel or other type of
gasoline consumed for the fiscal year and apply the appropriate CO2 emission factor for that
vehicle and type of fuel. A registrant that uses refrigerants also might apply the appropriate
emission factor for the particular type of refrigerant to the total amount of that refrigerant used
during the fiscal year. As part of the roll-up process for a registrant with multiple entities and
emission sources, once it has determined the amount of CO2e for each type of direct emissions
source and for each facility within its organizational and operational boundaries, the registrant
would then add them together to derive the total amount of Scope 1 emissions for the fiscal
year.
519

518 See, e.g., GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6 (providing an overview of
calculation tools by type of source (e.g., for stationary combustion, mobile combustion, and air conditioning and
refrigeration use) and by sector (e.g., for aluminum production, iron and steel production, cement
manufacturing, and pulp and paper production), which are available on the GHG Protocol website at
https://ghgprotocol.org/. The EPA also has published a Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator that is designed
as a simplified calculation tool to help small businesses and low emitter organizations estimate and inventory
their annual GHG emissions. See EPA, Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator (2021), available at
https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/simplified-ghg-emissions-calculator.
519 As noted earlier, a registrant that is required to report its direct emissions to the EPA may be able to use the
EPA-provided data, together with data for any direct emissions not reported to the EPA, to help fulfill the
Commission’s proposed Scope 1 emission disclosure requirement.
195
A registrant would undergo a similar process when calculating its Scope 2 emissions for
its most recently completed fiscal year. There are two common methods for calculating Scope 2
emissions for purchased electricity: the market-based method and the location-based method.520

Pursuant to the market-based method, a registrant would calculate its Scope 2 emissions based
on emission factors and other data provided by the generator of electricity from which the
registrant has contracted to purchase the electricity and which are included in the contractual
instruments. Pursuant to the location-based method, a registrant would calculate its Scope 2
emissions based on average energy generation emission factors for grids located in defined
geographic locations, including local, subnational, or national boundaries.
521 A registrant could
use either of these methods, both methods, a combination, or another method as long as it
identifies the method used and its source.522
 For example, if using the location-based method,
the registrant would apply an appropriate emission factor for the electricity grid in its region to
the total amount of electricity purchased from that grid during its fiscal year.523
 The registrant
would then calculate the amount of CO2e from purchased steam/heat, if any, by applying the
appropriate emission factor for that type of energy source to the total amount consumed.524
 The
520 See World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015), Chapter 4, available at
https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope%202%20Guidance_Final_Sept26.pdf.
521 See id.
522 We note that, pursuant to the GHG Protocol, and as referenced by the EPA, a company that determines its
Scope 2 emissions using a market-based approach would also calculate those emissions using the location-based
method to provide a more complete picture of the company’s Scope 2 emissions. See World Resources
Institute, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, Chapter 7; and EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership,
Scope 1 and Scope 2 Inventory Guidance.
523 See, e.g., EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Table 6, which provides emission factors for
regional electrical grids.
524 See, e.g., EPA, Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Table 7, which provides emission factors for
steam and heat.
196
registrant would report the sum of its CO2e from purchased electricity and steam/heat as its total
Scope 2 emissions for the fiscal year.
As noted above, in all instances a registrant would be required to describe its
methodology, including its organizational and operational boundaries, calculation approach
(including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors), and any calculation
tools used to calculate the GHG emissions.525
 Requiring a registrant to describe its methodology
for determining its GHG emissions should provide investors with important information to assist
them in evaluating the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure as part of its overall business and
financial disclosure. Such disclosure should enable investors to evaluate the reasonableness and
accuracy of the emission disclosures, and should promote consistency and comparability over
time. For example, an investor would be able to evaluate both if the registrant’s selection of an
emission factor is reasonable given the registrant’s industry sector and whether changes in
reported emissions reflect changes in actual emissions in accordance with its strategy or simply a
change in calculation methodology.
Like registrants in other sectors, registrants in the financial sector would be required to
disclose their Scope 3 emissions if those emissions are material and to describe the methodology
used to calculate those emissions. A financial registrant’s Scope 3 emissions disclosures would
likely include the emissions from companies that the registrant provides debt or equity financing
to (“financed emissions”). While financial registrants may use any appropriate methodology to
calculate its Scope 3 emissions, the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials’ Global GHG
Accounting & Reporting Standard (the “PCAF Standard”) provides one methodology that
525 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(1).
197
complements the GHG Protocol and assists financial institutions in calculating their financed
emissions.526
 The PCAF Standard was developed to work with the calculation of Scope 3
emissions for the “investment” category of downstream emissions and was endorsed by the
drafters of the GHG Protocol.
527 The PCAF Standard covers six asset classes: listed equity and
corporate bonds; business loans and unlisted equity; project finance; commercial real estate;
mortgages; and motor vehicle loans.528

At this time, we are not proposing to require a particular methodology for the financial
sector in order to provide a financial sector registrant the flexibility to choose the methodology
that best suits its particular portfolio and financing activities. We believe the proposed
requirement to disclose the methodology used (e.g., the PCAF Standard or another standard)
would provide sufficient information to an investor.
d. Additional Rules Related to Methodology Disclosure
We are proposing additional rules related to the methodology for calculating GHG
emissions. Some of these rules would apply generally to the determination of GHG emissions
while some would apply specifically to the calculation of Scope 3 emissions. For example, one
proposed rule would provide that a registrant may use reasonable estimates when disclosing its
GHG emissions as long as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using,
526 See PCAF, Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2020), available at
https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/PCAF-Global-GHG-Standard.pdf .
527 See id. See also GHG Protocol Press Release, New Standard Developed to Help Financial Industry Measure
and Report Emissions (Mar. 2021), available at https://ghgprotocol.org/blog/new-standard-developed-helpfinancial-industry-measure-and-report-emissions.
528 While the guidance provided by the PCAF Standard for each asset class differs in certain respects, the PCAF
Standard applies a common set of principles across the various asset classes. A key principle is that the GHG
emissions from a client’s activities financed by loans or investments attributable to the reporting financial
institution should be allocated to that institution based on its proportional share of lending or investment in the
borrower or investee through the application of an “attribution factor.” See PCAF, Global GHG Accounting &
Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2020), Sections 4.2 and 5.
198
the estimates.529
 While we encourage registrants to provide as accurate a measurement of its
GHG emissions as is reasonably possible, we recognize that, in many instances, direct
measurement of GHG emissions at the source, which would provide the most accurate
measurement, may not be possible.
Several commenters indicated that a registrant may find it difficult to complete its GHG
emissions calculations for its most recently completed fiscal year in time to meet its disclosure
obligations for that year’s Exchange Act annual report.530
 The proposed rules would permit a
registrant to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter if no
actual reported data is reasonably available, together with actual, determined GHG emissions
data for its first three fiscal quarters when disclosing its GHG emissions for its most recently
completed fiscal year, as long as the registrant promptly discloses in a subsequent filing any
material difference between the estimate used and the actual, determined GHG emissions data
for the fourth fiscal quarter.531
 We believe that this proposed provision would help address the
concerns of commenters about the timely completion of both the work required to disclose a
registrant’s GHG emissions as of its fiscal year-end and to meet its other Exchange Act annual
reporting obligations.532

Another proposed provision would require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material
and as applicable, any use of third-party data when calculating its GHG emissions, regardless of
529 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4).
530 See, e.g., letters from Cisco; Dow; Energy Infrastructure Council; National Mining Association; Newmont
Corporation; and United Airlines Holdings, Inc.
531 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4)(i). One commenter made a similar recommendation when stating that a
registrant should be required to follow the same timeline for disclosure of its GHG emissions as for its
Exchange Act annual reporting obligations. See letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
532 See supra note 530.
199
the particular scope of emissions.533
 While this proposed provision would be most relevant to
the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, where the use of third-party data is common, it would apply
in other instances when third-party data is material to the GHG emissions determination, such as
when determining Scope 2 emissions using contractual, supplier-provided emission factors for
purchased electricity. When disclosing the use of third-party data, a registrant would be required
to identify the source of the data and the process the registrant undertook to obtain and assess
such data.534
 This information would help investors better understand the basis for, and assess
the reasonableness of, the GHG emissions determinations and, accordingly, evaluate the GHG
disclosures as part of a registrant’s business and financial information.
One proposed provision would require a registrant to disclose any material change to the
methodology or assumptions underlying its GHG emissions disclosure from the previous fiscal
year.535
 For example, if a registrant uses a different set of emission factors, or develops a more
direct method of measuring GHG emissions, which results in a material change to the GHG
emissions produced from the previous year under (or assuming) the same organizational and
operational boundaries, it would be required to report that change. This should help investors
more knowledgeably compare the emissions data from year to year and better understand the
nature and significance of a material change in emissions (i.e., was the change primarily due to
an implementation of strategy or a change in methodology).
533 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(5).
534 See id.
535 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(6).
200
Another proposed provision would require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material
and as applicable, any gaps in the data required to calculate its GHG emissions.
536
 This proposed
provision would be particularly relevant to a registrant’s Scope 3 emissions. While a registrant’s
GHG emissions disclosure should provide investors with a reasonably complete understanding of
the registrant’s GHG emissions in each scope of emissions, as previously noted, we recognize
that a registrant may encounter data gaps, particularly when calculating its Scope 3 emissions.
The proposed provision would require the registrant to disclose the data gaps and discuss
whether it used proxy data or another method to address such gaps. A registrant would also be
required to discuss how its accounting for any data gaps has affected the accuracy or
completeness of its GHG emissions disclosure.537
 This information should help investors
understand certain underlying uncertainties and limitations, and evaluate the corresponding
reliability, of a registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure, particularly for its Scope 3 emissions, as
part of their assessment of the registrant’s business and financial information.
One proposed provision would provide that, when determining whether its Scope 3
emissions are material, and when disclosing those emissions, in addition to emissions from
activities in its value chain, a registrant must include GHG emissions from outsourced activities
that it previously conducted as part of its own operations, as reflected in the financial statements
for the periods covered in the filing.
538
 This proposed approach, which is consistent with the
GHG Protocol,539 would help ensure that investors receive a complete picture of a registrant’s
536 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(7).
537 See id.
538 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(8).
539 See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard,
Supplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Chapter 6.
201
carbon footprint by precluding the registrant from excluding emissions from activities that are
typically conducted as part of operations over which it has ownership or control but that are
outsourced in order to reduce its Scopes 1 or 2 emissions.
Another proposed provision would provide that, if a registrant is required to disclose
Scope 3 emissions, and if there was any significant overlap in the categories of activities
producing the Scope 3 emissions, the registrant must describe the overlap, how it accounted for
the overlap, and its disclosed total Scope 3 emissions.540
 For example, a mining registrant may
mine and process iron ore for conversion into steel products. Because the processing of iron ore
and steelmaking both require the use of coal, GHG emissions would arise both from the
downstream activities involving the processing of sold products and the use of sold products
(i.e., the use of iron ore in the production of steel). If the registrant has allocated GHG emissions
to both categories (i.e., processing of sold products and use of sold products), it would be
required to describe the overlap in emissions between the two categories of downstream
activities, how it accounted for the overlap, and the effect on its disclosed total Scope 3
emissions. For example, if the total reported Scope 3 emissions involved some double-counting
because of the overlap, a registrant would be required to report this effect. This information
could help investors better understand the true extent of a registrant’s disclosed Scope 3
emissions and, thus, the climate-related risks faced by the registrant.
Finally, a proposed provision would provide that a registrant may present its estimated
Scope 3 emissions in terms of a range as long as it discloses its reasons for using the range and
the underlying assumptions.541
 This proposed provision reflects our understanding that, because
540 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(9).
541 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(4)(ii).
202
a registrant may encounter more difficulties obtaining all of the data required for determining its
Scope 3 emissions compared to determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, presenting its Scope 3
emissions in terms of a range may be a reasonable means of estimating these emissions when
faced with such gaps in the data.
Request for Comment
115. Should we require a registrant to disclose the methodology, significant inputs, and
significant assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions metrics, as proposed? Should we
require a registrant to use a particular methodology for determining its GHG emission metrics?
If so, should the required methodology be pursuant to the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard and related standards and guidance? Is there another methodology that
we should require a registrant to follow when determining its GHG emissions? Should we base
our climate disclosure rules on certain concepts developed by the GHG Protocol without
requiring a registrant to follow the GHG Protocol in all respects, as proposed? Would this
provide flexibility for registrants to choose certain methods and approaches in connection with
GHG emissions determination that meet the particular circumstances of their industry or business
or that emerge along with developments in GHG emissions methodology as long as they are
transparent about the methods and underlying assumptions used? Are there adjustments that
should be made to the proposed methodology disclosure requirements that would provide
flexibility for registrants while providing sufficient comparability for investors?
116. Should we require a registrant to disclose the organizational boundaries used to
calculate its GHG emissions, as proposed? Should we require a registrant to determine its
organizational boundaries using the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other holdings
within its business organization as that used in its consolidated financial statements, as proposed?
203
Would prescribing this method of determining organizational boundaries avoid potential investor
confusion about the reporting scope used in determining a registrant’s GHG emissions and the
reporting scope used for the financial statement metrics, which are included in the financial
statements? Would prescribing this method of determining organizational boundaries result in
more robust guidance for registrants and enhanced comparability for investors? If, as proposed,
the organizational boundaries must be consistent with the scope of the registrant’s consolidated
financial statements, would requiring separate disclosure of the organizational boundaries be
redundant or otherwise unnecessary?
117. Except for calculating Scope 3 emissions, the proposed rules would not require a
registrant to disclose the emissions from investments that are not consolidated, proportionately
consolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting. Should we require such
disclosures for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and if so, how?
118. Could situations arise where it is impracticable for a registrant to align the scope of its
organizational boundaries for GHG emission data with the scope of the consolidation for the rest
of its financial statements? If so, should we allow a registrant to take a different approach to
determining the organizational boundaries of its GHG emissions and provide related disclosure,
including an estimation of the resulting difference in emissions disclosure (in addition to
disclosure about methodology and other matters that would be required by the proposed GHG
emissions disclosure rules)?
119. Alternatively, should we require registrants to use the organizational boundary
approaches recommended by the GHG Protocol (e.g., financial control, operational control, or
equity share)? Do those approaches provide a clear enough framework for complying with the
proposed rules? Would such an approach cause confusion when analyzing information in the
204
context of the consolidated financial statements or diminish comparability? If we permit a
registrant to choose one of the three organizational boundary approaches recommended by the
GHG Protocol, should we require a reconciliation with the scope of the rest of the registrant’s
financial reporting to make the disclosure more comparable?
120. Should we require a registrant to disclose its operational boundaries, as proposed?
Should we require a registrant to discuss its approach towards the categorization of emissions
(e.g., as direct or indirect emissions) and emissions sources (e.g., stationary or mobile) when
describing its operational boundaries, as proposed?
121. The proposed operational boundaries disclosure is based largely on concepts developed
by the GHG Protocol. Would requiring a registrant to determine its organizational boundaries
pursuant to the GAAP applicable to the financial statement metrics included in the financial
statements but its operational boundaries largely pursuant to concepts developed by the GHG
Protocol cause confusion? Should we require a registrant to apply the GAAP applicable to its
financial statements when determining whether it “controls” a particular source pursuant to the
definition of Scope 1 emissions, or particular operations pursuant to the definition of Scope 2
emissions, as proposed? If not, how should “control” be determined and would applying a
definition of control that differs from applicable GAAP result in confusion for investors?
122. Should we require a registrant to use the same organizational boundaries when
calculating its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as proposed? Are there any circumstances when a
registrant’s organizational boundaries for determining its Scope 2 emissions should differ from
those required for determining its Scope 1 emissions? Should we also require a registrant to
apply the same organizational boundaries used when determining its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions as
an initial step in identifying the sources of indirect emissions from activities in its value chain
205
over which it lacks ownership and control and which must be included in the calculation of its
Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Are there any circumstances where using a different
organizational boundary for purposes of Scope 3 emissions disclosure would be appropriate?
123. Should we require a registrant to be consistent in its use of its organizational and
operational boundaries once it has set those boundaries, as proposed? Would the proposed
requirement help investors to track and compare the registrant’s GHG emissions over time?
124. Should we require a registrant to disclose the methodology for calculating the GHG
emissions, including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors, as
proposed? Should we require a registrant to use a particular set of emission factors, such as
those provided by the EPA or the GHG Protocol?
125. Should we permit a registrant to use reasonable estimates when disclosing its GHG
emissions as long as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using, the
estimates, as proposed? Should we permit the use of estimates for only certain GHG emissions,
such as Scope 3 emissions? Should we permit a registrant to use a reasonable estimate of its
GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter if no actual reported data is reasonably available,
together with actual, determined GHG emissions data for its first three fiscal quarters when
disclosing its GHG emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year, as long as the registrant
promptly discloses in a subsequent filing any material difference between the estimate used and
the actual, determined GHG emissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter, as proposed? If so,
should we require a registrant to report any such material difference in its next Form 10-Q if
domestic, or in a Form 6-K, if a foreign private issuer? Should we permit a domestic registrant
to report any such material difference in a Form 8-K if such form is filed (rather than furnished)
206
with the Commission? Should any such reasonable estimate be subject to conditions to help
ensure accuracy and comparability? If so, what conditions should apply?
126. Should we require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material, any use of third-party
data when calculating its GHG emissions, regardless of the particular scope of emissions, as
proposed? Should we require the disclosure of the use of third-party data only for certain GHG
emissions, such as Scope 3 emissions? Should we require the disclosure of the use of thirdparty data for Scope 3 emissions, regardless of its materiality to the determination of those
emissions? If a registrant discloses the use of third-party data, should it also be required to
identify the source of such data and the process the registrant undertook to obtain and assess the
data, as proposed?
127. Should we require a registrant to disclose any material change to the methodology or
assumptions underlying its GHG emissions disclosure from the previous year, as proposed? If
so, should we require a registrant to restate its GHG emissions data for the previous year, or for
the number of years for which GHG emissions data has been provided in the filing, using the
changed methodology or assumptions? If a registrant’s organizational or operational boundaries,
in addition to methodology or assumptions, change, to what extent should we require such
disclosures of the material change, restatements or reconciliations? In these cases, should we
require a registrant to apply certain accounting standards or principles, such as FASB ASC Topic
250, as guidance regarding when retrospective disclosure should be required?
128. Should we require a registrant to disclose, to the extent material, any gaps in the data
required to calculate its GHG emissions, as proposed? Should we require the disclosure of data
gaps only for certain GHG emissions, such as Scope 3 emissions? If a registrant discloses any
data gaps encountered when calculating its Scope 3 emissions or other type of GHG emissions,
207
should it be required to discuss whether it used proxy data or another method to address such
gaps, and how its management of any data gaps has affected the accuracy or completeness of its
GHG emissions disclosure, as proposed? Are there other disclosure requirements or conditions
we should adopt to help investors obtain a reasonably complete understanding of a registrant’s
exposure to the GHG emissions sourced by each scope of emissions?
129. When determining the materiality of its Scope 3 emissions, or when disclosing those
emissions, should a registrant be required to include GHG emissions from outsourced activities
that it previously conducted as part of its own operations, as reflected in the financial statements
for the periods covered in the filing, in addition to emissions from activities in its value chain, as
proposed? Would this requirement help ensure that investors receive a complete picture of a
registrant’s carbon footprint by precluding the registrant from excluding emissions from
activities that are typically conducted as part of operations over which it has ownership or
control but that are outsourced in order to reduce its Scopes 1 or 2 emissions? Should a
requirement to include outsourced activities be subject to certain conditions or exceptions and, if
so, what conditions or exceptions?
130. Should we require a registrant that must disclose its Scope 3 emissions to discuss
whether there was any significant overlap in the categories of activities that produced the Scope
3 emissions? If so, should a registrant be required to describe any overlap, how it accounted for
the overlap, and its effect on the total Scope 3 emissions, as proposed? Would this requirement
help investors assess the accuracy and reliability of the Scope 3 emissions disclosure?
131. Should we permit a registrant to present its Scope 3 emissions in terms of a range as
long as it discloses its reasons for using the range and the underlying assumptions, as proposed?
Should we place limits or other parameters regarding the use of a range and, if so, what should
208
those limits or parameters be? For example, should we require a range to be no larger than a
certain size? What other conditions or guidance should we provide to help ensure that a range, if
used, is not overly broad and is otherwise reasonable?
132. Should we require a registrant to follow a certain set of published standards for
calculating Scope 3 emissions that have been developed for a registrant’s industry or that are
otherwise broadly accepted? For example, should we require a registrant in the financial
industry to follow PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard for the Financial
Industry when calculating its financed emissions within the “Investments” category of Scope 3
emissions? Are there other industry-specific standards that we should require for Scope 3
emissions disclosure? Should we require a registrant to follow the GHG Protocol’s Corporate
Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard if an industry-specific standard is not
available for Scope 3 emissions disclosure? If we should require the use of a third-party standard
for Scope 3 emissions reporting, or any other scope of emissions, how should we implement this
requirement?
3. The Scope 3 Emissions Disclosure Safe Harbor and Other Accommodations
We recognize that the calculation and disclosure of Scope 3 emissions may pose
difficulties compared to Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, which has caused concern for some
commenters.542
 It may be difficult to obtain activity data from suppliers and other third parties in
a registrant’s value chain, or to verify the accuracy of that information. It may also be necessary
to rely heavily on estimates and assumptions to generate Scope 3 emissions data. For example,
542 See, e.g., letter from Dimensional Fund Advisors; see also supra note 422.
209
registrants may need to rely on assumptions about how customers will use their products in order
to calculate Scope 3 emissions from the use of sold products.
Depending on the size and complexity of a company and its value chain, the task of
calculating Scope 3 emissions could be challenging.
543
 We expect that some of these challenges
may recede over time. For example, as more companies make their Scope 1 and 2 emissions
data publicly available, these data can serve as the input for other companies’ Scope 3
calculations. In addition, large companies that are voluntarily disclosing Scope 3 emissions
information currently are also working with suppliers to increase access to emissions data and
improve its reliability,
544 which could have positive spillover effects for other companies that use
the same suppliers. Furthermore, within certain industries, there is work underway to improve
methodologies and share best practices to make Scope 3 calculations less burdensome and more
reliable.545
 Notwithstanding these anticipated developments, calculating and disclosing Scope 3
543 While there may be less challenging approaches, such as using industry averages or proxies for activity data
(such as economic data), the result may be less accurate and could obscure the impact of choices that companies
may make to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. For example, if a company uses industry averages to calculate
Scope 3 emissions from shipping its products, it may have difficulty communicating to investors how its
selection of a shipping company that runs on lower emissions fuel or picks more efficient routes has lowered its
Scope 3 emissions.
544 See, e.g., Apple, Environmental Social Governance Report (2021), available at
https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/2021/08/2021_Apple_ESG_Report.pdf (stating that
Apple works with its suppliers to help address Apple’s environmental commitments, such as becoming carbon
neutral by 2030 across its entire product footprint).
545 See, e.g., PCAF, The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. In addition,
the American Petroleum Institute has developed an overview of Scope 3 methodologies to inform oil and gas
companies about Scope 3 estimation approaches. See API and IPIECA, Estimating petroleum industry value
chain (Scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions, available at https://www.api.org/~/media/Files/EHS/climatechange/Scope-3-emissions-reporting-guidance-2016.pdf. Finally, an initiative launched by food and beverage
companies, Danone and Mars, together with the Science Based Targets Initiative, aims to provide Scope 3
guidance to companies in difference industries, starting with the food and beverage industry. See SB, Serious
About Scope 3: Pioneering Companies Embracing Complexity, Reaping the Benefits, available at

emissions could represent a challenge for certain registrants, in particular those that do not
currently report such information on a voluntary basis.
To balance concerns about reporting Scope 3 emissions with the need for decision-useful
emissions disclosure, we are proposing the following accommodations for Scope 3 emissions
disclosure:
• A safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure from certain forms of liability under the
Federal securities laws;546
• An exemption for smaller reporting companies (“SRCs”) from the Scope 3 emissions
disclosure provision;547 and
• A delayed compliance date for Scope 3 emissions disclosure.548
We are proposing a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure to alleviate concerns
that registrants may have about liability for information that would be derived largely from third
parties in a registrant’s value chain. Many commenters recommended that the Commission
adopt a safe harbor for climate-related disclosures.549
 These commenters asserted that a safe
harbor would encourage registrants to provide meaningful, quantitative metrics and analysis.
Other commenters focused their recommendation for a safe harbor on certain types of climate546 See 17 CFR 229.1504(f).
547 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(3).
548 See infra Section II.M.

related disclosures, such as those pertaining to scenario analysis, third-party derived data (such
as Scope 3 emissions),550 or forward-looking statements generally.551
 With respect to Scope 3
emissions specifically, commenters recommended that the Commission provide a safe harbor
due to the reliance on estimates and data needed for Scope 3 emissions reporting that are outside
of the registrant’s control.552

While we are not proposing a broad safe harbor for all climate-related disclosures, many
of which are similar to other business and financial information required by Commission rules,
we are proposing a targeted safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions data in light of the unique
challenges associated with this information. The proposed safe harbor would provide that
disclosure of Scope 3 emissions by or on behalf of the registrant would be deemed not to be a
fraudulent statement unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed without a
reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith.553
 The safe harbor would extend to
any statement regarding Scope 3 emissions that is disclosed pursuant to proposed subpart 1500
of Regulation S-K and made in a document filed with the Commission.554
 For purposes of the
proposed safe harbor, the term “fraudulent statement” would be defined to mean a statement that
is an untrue statement of material fact, a statement false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, an omission to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading,

Community Bankers of America.

or that constitutes the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device,
contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business, or an artifice to defraud as
those terms are used in the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder.555
 The proposed safe harbor is intended to mitigate potential liability
concerns associated with providing emissions disclosure based on third-party information by
making clear that registrants would only be liable for such disclosure if it was made without a
reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith. It also may encourage more robust
Scope 3 emissions information, to the extent registrants feel reassured about relying on actual
third-party data as opposed to national or industry averages for their emissions estimates.
Several commenters expressed concern that the Commission would impose a “one size
fits all” approach, which could disproportionately impact smaller registrants, when adopting
climate-related disclosure rules.556
 Several commenters recommended that the Commission
phase-in or scale down the climate-related disclosure requirements for smaller registrants.557

Although we are not proposing to exempt SRCs from the full scope of the proposed
climate-related disclosure rules, we are proposing to exempt SRCs from the proposed Scope 3
emissions disclosure requirement.558
 We believe that exempting SRCs from the proposed Scope

CFR 230.175.

3 emissions disclosure requirement would be appropriate in light of the proportionately higher
costs they could incur, compared to non-SRCs, to engage in the data gathering, verification, and
other actions associated with Scope 3 emissions reporting, many of which may have fixed cost
components.
To further ease the burden of complying with the proposed Scope 3 disclosure
requirement, we are also proposing a delayed compliance date for this requirement. As
explained in greater detail below, all registrants, regardless of their size, would have an
additional year to comply initially with the Scope 3 disclosure requirement beyond the
compliance date for the other proposed rules. Moreover, because a registrant’s Scope 3
emissions consist of the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of its suppliers, distributors, and other third
parties in the registrant’s value chain, to the extent those parties become subject to the proposed
rules, the increased availability of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions data following the rules’
effectiveness should help ease the burden of complying with the Scope 3 emissions disclosure
requirement.
Finally, we note that Securities Act Rule 409 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21, which
provide accommodations for information that is unknown and not reasonably available, would be
available for the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosures.
559
 These rules allow for the
conditional omission of required information when such information is unknown and not
reasonably available to the registrant, either because obtaining the information would involve
559 See 17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 240.12b-21.
214
unreasonable effort or expense, or because the information rests peculiarly within the knowledge
of another person not affiliated with the registrant.560
Request for Comment
133. Should we provide a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure, as proposed? Is the
scope of the proposed safe harbor clear and appropriate? For example, should the safe harbor
apply to any registrant that provides Scope 3 disclosure pursuant to the proposed rules, as
proposed? Should we limit the use of the safe harbor to certain classes of registrants or to
registrants meeting certain conditions and, if so, which classes or conditions? For example,
should we require the use of a particular methodology for calculating and reporting Scope 3
emissions, such as the PCAF Standard if the registrant is a financial institution, or the GHG
Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard for other types of registrants? Should we
clarify the scope of persons covered by the language “by or on behalf of a registrant” by
including language about outside reviewers retained by the registrant or others? Should we
define a “fraudulent statement,” as proposed? Is the level of diligence required for the proposed
safe harbor (i.e., that the statement was made or reaffirmed with a reasonable basis and disclosed
in good faith) the appropriate standard? Should the safe harbor apply to other climate-related
disclosures, such as Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures, any targets and goals disclosures in
response to proposed Item 1505 (discussed below), or the financial statement metrics disclosures
required pursuant to Proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X? Should the safe harbor apply
indefinitely, or should we include a sunset provision that would eliminate the safe harbor some
number of years, (e.g., five years) after the effective date or applicable compliance date of the
560 See id. We expect, however, that a registrant that requires emissions data from another registrant in its value
chain would be able to obtain that data without unreasonable effort or expense because of the increased
availability of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions data for registrants following the effectiveness of the proposed rules.
215
rules? Should the safe harbor sunset after certain conditions are satisfied? If so, what types of
conditions should we consider? What other approaches should we consider?
134. Should we provide an exemption from Scope 3 emissions disclosure for SRCs, as
proposed? Should the exemption not apply to a SRC that has set a target or goal or otherwise
made a commitment to reduce its Scope 3 emissions? Are there other classes of registrants we
should exempt from the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement? For example, should we
exempt EGCs, foreign private issuers, or a registrant that is filing or has filed a registration
statement for its initial public offering during its most recently completed fiscal year from the
Scope 3 disclosure requirement? Instead of an exemption, should we provide a longer phase in
for the Scope 3 disclosure requirements for SRCs than for other registrants?
H. Attestation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions Disclosure
1. Overview
The proposed rules would require a registrant, including a foreign private issuer, that is
an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer to include in the relevant filing an attestation report
covering the disclosure of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions561 and to provide certain related
disclosures about the service provider.562
 As proposed, the attestation engagement must, at a
561 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a). In order to attest to the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, we believe a
GHG emissions attestation provider would need to include in its evaluation relevant contextual information. In
particular, the attestation provider would be required to evaluate the registrant’s compliance with (i) proposed
Item 1504(a), which includes presentation requirements (e.g., disaggregation by each constituent greenhouse
gas), (ii) the calculation instructions included in proposed Item 1504(b), and (iii) the disclosure requirements in
proposed Item 1504(e) regarding methodology, organizational boundary, and operational boundary. See infra
Section II.H.3 for further discussion of the criteria against which the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure are
measured or evaluated.
562 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d).
216
minimum, be at the following assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG
emissions disclosure:
563
Limited Assurance Reasonable Assurance
Fiscal Years 2 and 3 after Scopes 1 and 2
emissions disclosure compliance date
Fiscal Years 4 and beyond after Scopes 1 and 2
emissions disclosure compliance date
To provide additional clarity, the following table illustrates the application of the
transition periods assuming that the proposed rules will be adopted with an effective date in
December 2022 and that the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer has a December 31st fiscal
year-end:
Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 GHG

Filer
Fiscal year 2023 (filed in 2024) Fiscal year 2024

(filed in 2027)
* See infra Section II.M for a discussion of the proposed disclosure compliance dates for Scopes 1 and 2 GHG
emissions disclosure. If the accelerated filer or the large accelerated filer has a non-calendar-year fiscal year-end
date that results in its 2024 or 2023 fiscal year, respectively, commencing before the compliance dates of the
rules, it would not be required to comply with proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirements until the
following fiscal year (as discussed below in Section II.M). Accordingly, for such filers, the time period for
compliance with the corresponding attestation requirements under proposed Item 1505 would be one year later
than illustrated above.
During the transition period when limited assurance is required, the proposed rules would
permit an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer, at its option, to obtain reasonable
assurance of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosure.564
 For example, an accelerated filer or a
563 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(1).
564 Reasonable assurance is equivalent to the level of assurance provided in an audit of a registrant’s consolidated
financial statements included in a Form 10-K. Limited assurance is equivalent to the level of assurance
(commonly referred to as a “review”) provided over a registrant’s interim financial statements included in a
Form 10-Q.
217
large accelerated filer may choose to obtain reasonable assurance such that its GHG emissions
disclosure receives the same level of assurance as its financial statements.565

At its option, an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer would be able to obtain any
level of assurance over its climate-related disclosures that are not required to be assured pursuant
to proposed Item 1505(a). For example, an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer could
voluntarily include an attestation report at the limited assurance level for its GHG intensity
metrics or its Scope 3 emissions disclosure. To avoid potential confusion, however, the
voluntary assurance obtained by such filer would be required to follow the requirements of
proposed Item 1505(b)–(d), including using the same attestation standard as the required
assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2.566
 For filings made by accelerated filers and large
accelerated filers after the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but
before proposed Item 1505(a) requires limited assurance, the filer would only be required to
provide the disclosure called for by proposed Item 1505(e). As discussed below in Section
II.H.5, a registrant that is not an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer that obtains
voluntary assurance would be required to comply only with proposed Item 1505(e).
565 We refer to “assurance” broadly when describing the level and scope of assurance to which climate-related
disclosures should be subject. Our proposed approach to assurance has been guided by “attestation” standards
published by organizations including the PCAOB, AICPA, and the International Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board (“IAASB”). Such attestation standards apply to engagements other than audit and review of
historical financial statements and have been widely used in the current voluntary ESG and GHG assurance
market for a number of years.
566 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2). If the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer was required to obtain
reasonable assurance over its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosures and the attestation provider chose to
follow, for example, the AICPA attestation standards, the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer could
voluntarily obtain limited assurance over its GHG intensity metric or Scope 3 emissions disclosures, and the
attestation provider would be required to follow the AICPA’s attestation standard for providing limited
assurance.
218
Many commenters recommended that we require climate-related disclosures to be subject
to some level of assurance to enhance the reliability of the disclosures.567
 Commenters noted
that companies are increasingly seeking some type of third-party assurance or verification over
ESG and climate-related disclosures. For example, according to one commenter, 80 percent of
S&P 100 companies currently subject certain items of their ESG information, including climaterelated disclosures such as greenhouse gas emissions, to some type of third-party assurance or
verification.
568
 Several commenters recommended that we require climate-related disclosures to
be subject to limited assurance,569 which provides a lower level of assurance than reasonable
assurance, but is less costly, and is the most common form of assurance provided for ESG,
including climate-related disclosures, in the current voluntary reporting landscape.
570

One commenter recommended that, at a minimum, we require a registrant to obtain a
limited assurance report for its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure while encouraging optional
verification for other ESG metrics.571
 Another commenter indicated that a limited assurance
requirement for climate-related disclosures would be similar to the EU’s Corporate Sustainability

Reporting Directive proposal that, if adopted, would initially require companies in the European
Union to obtain limited assurance on reported sustainability information with an option to move
towards reasonable assurance in the future.
572
 One commenter stated the view that, while the
professional capacity of audit firms might, at this point, be insufficient to provide reasonable
assurance of ESG data, it supported a mandatory limited assurance requirement for climate risk
reporting.573
 Other commenters recommended that we require climate-related disclosures to be
audited at the reasonable assurance level.574

Some commenters, however, opposed any third-party assurance requirement for climaterelated disclosures because of the significant cost that these commenters asserted it could impose
on public companies, and because, in their view, application of assurance standards to data that is
different from traditional financial reporting disclosures, such as GHG emissions, would be a
relatively new and evolving field.575
 Some of these commenters indicated that, as a first step,
registrants should develop their internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures (“DCP”)
to include climate-related disclosures, and defer mandated third-party assurance requirements to
a later time.576

We recognize that requiring GHG emissions disclosure in Commission filings should
enhance the consistency, comparability, and reliability of such disclosures due to the application
572 See letter from CAQ.
573 See letter from Credit Suisse.
574 See, e.g., letters from Ceres et al.; and Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.
575 See, e.g., letters from American Petroleum Institute; Investment Company Institute; and National Association of
Manufacturers.
576 See, e.g., letters from American Petroleum Institute; and Investment Company Institute. We agree that
registrants should develop their DCP to include their GHG emissions disclosures. When the proposed GHG
emissions disclosures are included in Form 10-K and Form 20-F annual reports, our rules governing DCP
would apply to those disclosures. See 17 CFR 240.13a-15 and 240.15d-15.
220
of DCP and the proposed inclusion of certain prescriptive elements that may help improve
standardization of GHG emissions calculations. Nevertheless, the evolving and unique nature of
GHG emissions reporting involves and, in some cases, warrants varying methodologies, differing
assumptions, and a substantial amount of estimation. Certain aspects of GHG emissions
disclosure also involve reliance on third-party data. As such, requiring a third party’s attestation
over these disclosures would provide investors with an additional degree of reliability regarding
not only the figures that are disclosed, but also the key assumptions, methodologies, and data
sources the registrant used to arrive at those figures. In other contexts, such as mineral resources
and oil and gas reserves, the Commission has recognized the value that third parties with
specialized expertise in audit and engineering can bring to company disclosures of physical
resources or risks.577

Our rules typically do not require registrants to obtain assurance over disclosure provided
outside of the financial statements, including quantitative disclosure. We believe, however, that
there are important distinctions between existing quantitative disclosure required to be provided
outside of the financial statements and the proposed GHG emissions disclosure. In contrast to
GHG emissions disclosure, quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements typically is
derived, at least in part, from the same books and records that are used to generate a registrant’s
audited financial statements and accompanying notes and that are subject to ICFR. Accordingly,
such quantitative disclosure has been subject to audit procedures as part of the audit of the
577 See 17 CFR 229.1302 (requiring a registrant’s disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, or mineral
reserves to be based on and accurately reflect information and supporting documentation prepared by a
qualified person, which, pursuant to 17 CFR 229.1300, is defined to mean a mineral industry professional with
at least five years of relevant experience in the type of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration
who meets certain additional criteria); and 17 CFR 229.1202(a)(7) (requiring a registrant to disclose the
qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the oil and gas
reserves estimates or reserves audit).
221
financial statements in the same filing. Further, the auditor’s read and consider obligation
requires an evaluation of this quantitative information based on the information obtained through
the audit of the financial statements.
578 Unlike other quantitative information that is provided
outside of the financial statements, GHG emissions disclosure would generally not be developed
from information that is included in the registrant’s books and records and, therefore, would not
be subjected to audit procedures.579
 In addition, although not an assurance engagement, we have
adopted rules requiring an expert to review and provide conclusions on other specialized,
quantitative data that is provided outside of the financial statements.580
 Accordingly, to enhance
its reliability, we believe it is appropriate to require that GHG emissions disclosure be subject to
third-party attestation.
For similar reasons, we also considered proposing to require that management assess and
disclose the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosure (apart from the existing
requirements with respect to the assessment and effectiveness of DCP). More specifically, in
addition to the requirement to assess such controls, we considered whether to require
management to include a statement in their annual report regarding their responsibility for the
578 See PCAOB AS 2710 Other Information in Documents Containing Audited Financial Statements (requiring an
auditor to read the other information (included in an annual report with the audited financial statements) and
consider whether such information, or the manner of its presentation, is materially inconsistent with
information, or the manner of its presentation, appearing in the financial statements). For example, disclosure
pursuant to 17 CFR 229.303 (Item 303 of Regulation S-K – MD&A) is derived in part from the same books and
records that are subject to ICFR and used to generate a registrant’s audited financial statements and
accompanying notes (e.g., the liquidity and capital resources disclosures are anchored to the audited cash flows
information disclosed in the financial statements).
579 Although GHG emission disclosure would generally not be directly derived from the same books and records
that are used to generate a registrant’s audited financial statements and accompanying notes and that are subject
to ICFR , GHG emission disclosure, as proposed, would be required to use the same organizational and
operational boundaries as the registrant’s financial statement disclosures. See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(e)(2).

design and evaluation of controls over GHG emissions disclosures, as well as to disclose their
conclusion regarding the effectiveness of such controls. We also considered proposing to require
a GHG emissions attestation provider’s attestation of the effectiveness of controls over GHG
emissions disclosure in addition to the proposed attestation over the Scopes 1 and 2 GHG
emissions disclosure. Although both such requirements could further enhance the reliability of
the related Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosure, we are not currently proposing them at
this time. We are, however, continuing to consider these alternatives, including: (i) the need to
develop guidance for management on conducting such an assessment and (ii) whether
appropriate attestation standards exist. Accordingly, we request comment on these and related
issues below.
The Commission has long recognized the important role played by an independent audit
in contributing to the reliability of financial reporting.581 Relatedly, studies suggest that
investors have greater confidence in information that has been assured, particularly when it is
assured at the reasonable assurance level.582
 Although a limited assurance engagement provides
a lower level of assurance than a reasonable assurance engagement,583 studies of ESG-related
assurance, which is typically provided at a limited assurance level, have found benefits such as

credibility enhancement, lower cost of equity capital, and lower analyst forecast errors and
dispersion.584
 Therefore, proposing to require Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure by
accelerated filers and large accelerated filers be subject to limited assurance initially, with an
eventual scaling up to reasonable assurance, could potentially improve both the actual reliability
of disclosure and investor confidence in such disclosure.585
Increasing investor demand for consistent, comparable, and reliable climate-related
financial information appears to have led a growing number of companies to voluntarily obtain
third-party assurance over their climate-related disclosures both within the U.S. and globally.
For example, according to one study, 53% of the S&P 500 companies had some form of
assurance or verification over climate-related metrics, along with other metrics.586
 Another
survey of sustainability reporting trends from 5,200 companies across 52 countries (including the
United States) stated that, of the top 100 companies (by revenue), 80% have reporting on ESG
(including climate), with up to 61% of those companies also obtaining assurance.587

prevalence of major companies obtaining assurance in connection with their voluntary
sustainability reports suggests that both the companies and their investors are focused on the
reliability of such disclosures.
Although many registrants have voluntarily obtained some level of assurance for their
climate-related disclosures, current voluntary ESG assurance practices have been varied with
respect to the levels of assurance provided (e.g., limited versus reasonable), the assurance
standards used, the types of service providers, and the scope of disclosures covered by the
assurance. This fragmentation has diminished the comparability of the assurance provided and
may require investors to become familiar with many different assurance standards and the
varying benefits of different levels of assurance. The consequences of such fragmentation has
also been highlighted by certain international organizations,588 including IOSCO, which stated
that the “perceived lack of clarity and consistency around the purpose and scope of [voluntary]
assurance . . . potentially lead[s] to market confusion, including misleading investors and
exacerbating the expectations gap.”589
 For example, investors may see that a service provider
has produced an assurance report for a registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure and have an
expectation that such assurance will enhance the reliability of that disclosure without always
understanding the service provider’s qualifications for producing the report, what level of
assurance (e.g., limited versus reasonable) is being provided, what scope of assurance (e.g., the
disclosures covered by the assurance) is being provided with respect to the registrant’s GHG

emissions disclosure, and the methodologies and procedures that the attestation provider used.
While some experienced assurance providers may be proficient in applying attestation standards
to GHG emissions disclosures, other assurance providers may lack GHG emissions expertise.
Similarly, some service providers providing assurance may have expertise in GHG emissions but
have minimal assurance experience. Moreover, some service providers may use standards that
are developed by accreditation bodies with notice and public comment and other robust due
process procedures590 for standard setting, while other service providers may use privately
developed “verification” standards.
591
To improve accuracy, comparability, and consistency with respect to the proposed GHG
emissions disclosure, we are proposing to require a minimum level of attestation services for
accelerated filers and large accelerated filers including: (1) limited assurance for Scopes 1 and 2
emissions disclosure that scales up to reasonable assurance after a specified transition period; (2)
minimum qualifications and independence requirements for the attestation service provider; and
(3) minimum requirements for the accompanying attestation report. These proposed
requirements would be minimum standards that the GHG emissions attestation provider engaged
by accelerated filers and large accelerated filers must meet, but, as mentioned above, would not
prevent a registrant from obtaining a heightened level of assurance over its climate-related
disclosures (prior to the transition to reasonable assurance) or to obtain assurance over climaterelated disclosures other than Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
590 See infra Section II.H.3.
591 See, e.g., CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021) (pointing to the use of assurance methodologies
developed by individual service providers, which in some cases were based on IAASB International Standard
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 with modifications).
226
By specifying minimum standards for the attestation provided with respect to GHG
emissions disclosure by accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, the proposed rules should
improve accuracy and consistency in the reporting of this information, while also providing
investors with an enhanced level of reliability against which to evaluate the disclosure. In
addition to the proposed minimum standards for attestation services, the proposed additional
disclosure requirements for registrants, described below, should further assist investors in
understanding the qualifications and suitability of the GHG emissions attestation provider
selected by the registrant, particularly in light of the broad spectrum of attestation providers that
would be permitted to provide attestation services under the proposed rules.
Although we are proposing certain minimum standards for attestation services, this
proposal does not aim to create or adopt a specific attestation standard for assuring GHG
emissions, just as this proposal does not define a single methodology for calculating GHG
emissions. This is because both the reporting and attestation landscapes are currently evolving
and it would be premature to adopt one approach and potentially curtail future innovations in
these two areas. The evolving nature of GHG emissions calculations and attestation standards
could suggest that it may also be premature to require assurance. We are soliciting comment on
the feasibility of our proposal and will consider any public feedback received, but we have
preliminarily determined that the phased-in approach that we are proposing, along with an
extended period for disclosure compliance for accelerated filers, balances the benefits of thirdparty review with the costs of seeking assurance in this evolving space.
The proposed minimum standards for attestation services and the proposed additional
disclosure requirements would not eliminate fragmentation with respect to assurance or obviate
the need for investors to assess and compare multiple attestation standards. Nevertheless, we
227
believe some flexibility in our approach is warranted at this time given the unique and evolving
nature of third-party assurance for climate-related disclosures. We believe the proposed
minimum standards and additional disclosure requirements would enable investors to better
understand the assurance that has been provided.
We are cognizant of the fact that the calculation and disclosure of GHG emissions would
be new for many registrants, as would be the application of assurance standards to GHG
emissions disclosure. For these reasons and the reasons discussed in greater detail below, we are
proposing to require assurance (1) only for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, (2) only
with respect to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and (3) with an initial transition period for
limited assurance and a subsequent transition period for reasonable assurance.
Although we have considered the challenges that mandatory assurance of GHG emissions
disclosure could present, accelerated filers and large accelerated filers should have the necessary
resources to devote to complying with such requirements over the proposed implementation
timetable. For the many large accelerated filers that are already voluntarily obtaining some form
of assurance over their GHG emissions, any cost increases associated with complying with the
proposed rules would be mitigated.592
 Furthermore, larger issuers generally bear proportionately
592 See, e.g., CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Aug. 9, 2021) (providing statistics on limited assurance versus
reasonable assurance obtained voluntarily in the current market (e.g., at least 26 of 31 companies that obtained
assurance from public company auditors obtained limited assurance; at least 174 of 235 companies that
obtained assurance or verification from other service providers (non-public company auditors) obtained limited
assurance)). For similar information on the S&P 100, see CAQ, S&P 100 and ESG Reporting (Apr. 29, 2021),
available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp-100-and-esg-reporting/. Based on an analysis by Commission staff on
Mar. 3, 2022, a substantial number of the S&P 500 companies (460+) are large accelerated filers and therefore
would be subject to the proposed assurance requirements.
228
lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of such
compliance.593

The proposed transition periods would also provide existing accelerated filers and large
accelerated filers one fiscal year to transition to limited assurance594 and two additional fiscal
years to transition to reasonable assurance.595
 For existing accelerated filers, this transition
period would be in addition to the one additional year they will have to comply with the Scopes 1
and 2 emission disclosure requirements (compared to large accelerated filers). As such, these
filers would have significant time to develop processes to support their GHG emissions
disclosure requirements and the relevant DCP, as well as to adjust to the incremental costs and
efforts associated with escalating levels of assurance. During this transition period, GHG
emissions attestation providers would also have time to prepare themselves for providing such
services in connection with Commission filings.
In addition to the challenges posed by the newness of calculating and disclosing GHG
emissions, we believe that only requiring assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions would
be appropriate because the emissions result directly or indirectly from facilities owned or
activities controlled by a registrant, which makes it relatively more accessible and easier to
subject to the registrant’s DCP compared to Scope 3 data. Further, as discussed earlier, many
593 See infra note 948 in Section IV.C of the Economic Analysis for further discussion on proportionate costs
between different types of filers.
594 See infra note 604 for a discussion of the key differences between limited and reasonable assurance
engagements.
595 By limiting the assurance requirements to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, a new registrant would
not be required to provide assurance until it has been subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months and it has filed at least one annual report pursuant
to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. See 17 CFR 240.12b-2. Therefore, no registrant would be
required to provide assurance covering its GHG emissions disclosure during an initial public offering.
However, any registrant that voluntarily includes an attestation report for GHG emissions disclosure would be
required to comply with proposed Item 1505(e).
229
registrants already voluntarily seek assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure
(predominately Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures),596 which further supports the feasibility and
readiness of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure for mandatory assurance. In contrast, we
are not proposing to require assurance of Scope 3 emissions disclosure at this time because the
preparation of such disclosure presents unique challenges.597
 Depending on the size and
complexity of a company and its value chain, the task of calculating Scope 3 emissions could be
relatively more burdensome and expensive than calculating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. In
particular, it may be difficult to obtain activity data from suppliers, customers, and other third
parties in a registrant’s value chain, or to verify the accuracy of that information compared to
disclosures of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data, which are more readily available to a
registrant.
We are proposing to require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain
limited assurance, with an eventual scaling up to reasonable assurance. The objective of a
limited assurance engagement is for the service provider to express a conclusion about whether it

is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the subject matter (e.g., the Scopes
1 and 2 emissions disclosure) in order for it to be fairly stated or in accordance with the relevant
criteria (e.g., the methodology and other disclosure requirements specified in proposed 17 CFR
229.1504 (Item 1504 of Regulation S-K).598
 In such engagements, the conclusion is expressed in
the form of negative assurance regarding whether any material misstatements have been
identified.599
 In contrast, the objective of a reasonable assurance engagement, which is the same
level of assurance provided in an audit of a registrant’s consolidated financial statements, is to
express an opinion on whether the subject matter is in accordance with the relevant criteria, in all
material respects. A reasonable assurance opinion provides positive assurance that the subject
matter is free from material misstatement.600

Reasonable assurance is feasible whenever limited assurance can be provided on a
subject,601 and as noted above the voluntary attestation obtained by some registrants has been at
the reasonable assurance level.602
 We understand, however, that a limited assurance engagement
598 See, e.g., AICPA’s Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No.22, AT-C Section 210.
599 See infra Section II.H.3 for further discussion of the attestation report requirements, including the difference
between a conclusion and an opinion.
600 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C Sections 205 and 206.
601
 Under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance
engagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the
engagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. Thus, if the subject matter is appropriate
for a limited assurance engagement, it is also appropriate for a reasonable assurance engagement. See AICPA
SSAE No. 18 (Apr. 2016); and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) (Dec. 2013).
602 For example, some registrants have voluntarily sought reasonable assurance over certain information, including
Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, for which others have voluntarily sought limited assurance. See, e.g., Apple, Inc.
Environmental Progress Report (Mar. 2021), at 88-90, available at

231
is less extensive and is currently the level of assurance most commonly provided603 in the
voluntary assurance market for climate-related disclosure.604
 Therefore, prior to the transition to
reasonable assurance, the additional compliance efforts required to comply with the proposed
assurance requirement should be limited for the many registrants that—according to commenters
and others—are already obtaining limited assurance for their climate-related disclosures.605

Furthermore, although reasonable assurance provides a significantly higher level of assurance
than limited assurance, we believe limited assurance would benefit investors during the initial
transition period by enhancing the reliability of a registrant’s Scopes 1 and 2 emissions
disclosure, in light of the benefits that assurance provides, as discussed above. Moreover, under
the proposed rules, accelerated filers and large accelerated filers would not be prevented from
obtaining reasonable assurance for their climate disclosures earlier than required. After the
transition to mandatory reasonable assurance, investors would have the benefits of a higher level
of assurance with smaller incremental costs to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers than
moving directly to a reasonable assurance requirement.
603 See supra note 592 (providing statistics on limited assurance obtained voluntarily in the current market).
604 The scope of work in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than a reasonable assurance
engagement. The primary difference between the two levels of assurance relates to the nature, timing, and
extent of procedures required to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to support the limited assurance
conclusion or reasonable assurance opinion. Limited assurance engagements primarily include procedures such
as inquiries and analytical procedures and do not necessarily include a consideration of whether internal
controls have been effectively designed, whereas reasonable assurance engagements require the assurance
service provider to consider and obtain an understanding of internal controls. More extensive testing
procedures beyond inquiries and analytical procedures, including recalculation and verification of data inputs,
are also required in reasonable assurance engagements, such as inspecting source documents that support
transactions selected on a sample basis. Driven by these differences, the cost of limited assurance is generally
lower than that of reasonable assurance.

assurance obtained by S&P 100 and S&P 500 companies).

Request for Comment
135. Should we require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation
report covering their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure, as proposed? Should we
require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation report
covering other aspects of their climate-related disclosures beyond Scope 1 and 2
emissions? For example, should we also require the attestation of GHG intensity metrics,
or of Scope 3 emissions, if disclosed? Conversely, should we require accelerated filers
and large accelerated filers to obtain assurance covering only Scope 1 emissions
disclosure? Should any voluntary assurance obtained by these filers after limited
assurance is required be required to follow the same attestation requirements of Item
1505(b)–(d), as proposed?
136. If we required accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation report
covering Scope 3 emissions disclosure, should the requirement be phased-in over time? If
so, what time frame? Should we require all Scope 3 emissions disclosure to be subject to
assurance or only certain categories of Scope 3 emissions? Would it be possible for
accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain an attestation report covering the
process or methodology for calculating Scope 3 emissions rather than obtaining an
attestation report covering the calculations of Scope 3 emissions? Alternatively, is there
another form of verification over Scope 3 disclosure that would be more appropriate than
obtaining an attestation report?
137. Should the attestation requirement be limited to accelerated filers and large accelerated
filers, as proposed? Alternatively, should the attestation requirement be limited to a subset
of accelerated filers and large accelerated filers? If so, what conditions should apply?
233
Should the attestation requirement only apply to well-known seasoned issuers?606
 Should
the attestation requirement also apply to other types of registrants? Should we create a
new test for determining whether the attestation requirements apply to a registrant that
would take into account the resources of the registrant and also apply to initial public
offerings? For example, should we create a test similar to the SRC definition,607 which
includes a separate determination for initial registration statements, but using higher
public float and annual revenue amounts?
138. Instead of requiring only accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to include an
attestation report for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, should the proposed attestation
requirements also apply to registrants other than accelerated filers and large accelerated
filers? If so, should the requirement apply only after a specified transition period? Should
such registrants be required to provide assurance at the same level as accelerated filers and
large accelerated filers and over the same scope of GHG emissions disclosure, or should
we impose lesser requirements (e.g., only limited assurance and/or assurance over Scope 1
emissions disclosure only)?
139. Should we require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to initially include
attestation reports reflecting attestation engagements at a limited assurance level,
eventually increasing to a reasonable assurance level, as proposed? What level of
assurance should apply to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure, if any, and when
should that level apply? Should we provide a one fiscal year transition period between the
GHG emissions disclosure compliance date and when limited assurance would be required
606 See 17 CFR 230.405 (defining “well-known seasoned issuer”).
607 See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.12b-2.
234
for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, as proposed? Should we provide an
additional two fiscal year transition period between when limited assurance is first
required and when reasonable assurance is required for accelerated filers and large
accelerated filers, as proposed?
140. Should we provide the same transition periods (from the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions
disclosure compliance date) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, as proposed?
Instead, should different transition periods apply to accelerated filers and large accelerated
filers? Should we provide transition periods with different lengths than those proposed?
Should we require the attestation to be at a reasonable assurance level without having a
transition period where only limited assurance is required? Should we instead impose
assurance requirements to coincide with reporting compliance periods?
141. Under prevailing attestation standards, “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance”
are defined terms that we believe are generally understood in the marketplace, both by
those seeking and those engaged to provide such assurance. As a result, we have not
proposed definitions of those terms. Should we define “limited assurance” and
“reasonable assurance” and, if so, how should we define them? Would providing
definitions in this context cause confusion in other attestation engagements not covered by
the proposed rules? Are the differences between these types of attestation engagements
sufficiently clear without providing definitions?
142. As proposed, there would be no requirement for a registrant to either provide a separate
assessment and disclosure of the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosure
by management or obtain an attestation report from a GHG emissions attestation provider
specifically covering the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosure.
235
Should we require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to provide a separate
management assessment and disclosure of the effectiveness of controls over GHG
emissions disclosure (separate from the existing requirements with respect to the
assessment and effectiveness of DCP)? Should we require management to provide a
statement in their annual report on their responsibility for the design and evaluation of
controls over GHG emissions disclosure and to disclose their conclusion regarding the
effectiveness of such controls? Instead of, or in addition to, such management assessment
and statement, should we require the registrant to obtain an attestation report from a GHG
emissions attestation provider that covers the effectiveness of such GHG emissions
controls as of the date when the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer is required to
comply with the reasonable assurance requirement under proposed Item 1505(a)? If so:
(i) Would it be confusing to apply either such requirement in light of the existing DCP
requirements that would apply to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure?
(ii) Would a separate management assessment and statement on the effectiveness of
controls over GHG emissions provide meaningful disclosure to investors beyond the
existing requirement for DCP?
(iii) Should we specify that the separate management assessment and statement must be
provided by the accelerated filer’s or large accelerated filer’s principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions? Should we
clarify which members of the accelerated filer or large accelerated filer’s
management should be involved in performing the underlying assessment?
(iv) What controls framework(s) would the effectiveness of the registrant’s controls over
GHG emissions disclosure be evaluated against, if any?
236
(v) For the GHG emissions attestation provider, what requirements should be applied to
such GHG emissions disclosure controls attestation requirement? For example, what
attestation standards should apply? Should other service provider(s) in addition to or
in lieu of the GHG emissions attestation provider be permitted to provide such
attestation over the effectiveness of the GHG controls?
(vi) Should we limit such a requirement to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers
only or should it apply to other registrants as well?
(vii)What would be the potential benefits and costs of either approach?
(viii) Should we require a certification on the design and evaluation of controls over GHG
emissions disclosures by officers serving in the principal executive and principal
financial officer roles or persons performing similar functions for an accelerated filer
or large accelerated filer? Would a certification requirement have any additional
benefits or impose any additional costs when compared to a requirement for
management to assess and disclose in a statement in the annual report the
effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions?
143. We considered whether to require registrants to include the GHG emissions metrics in
the notes or a separate schedule to their financial statements, by amending Regulation S-X
instead of Regulation S-K.
(i) Would there be benefits to including this information in a registrant’s financial
statements? For example, would requiring the GHG emissions disclosure to be
included in the financial statements improve the consistency, comparability, reliability,
and decision-usefulness of the information for investors? Would it facilitate the
integration of GHG metrics and targets into the registrant’s financial analysis? Would
237
such placement cause registrants to incur significantly more expense in obtaining an
audit of the disclosure? If so, please quantify those additional expenses where
possible.
(ii) Should we require a registrant to include the GHG emissions disclosure in its audited
financial statements so that the disclosure would be subject to the existing
requirements for an independent audit and ICFR? If so, we seek comment on the
following aspects of this alternative:
(a) If GHG emissions disclosure is subject to ICFR, or an internal control framework
similar to ICFR, would GHG emissions disclosure be more reliable compared to
what is currently proposed? What are the benefits or costs?
(b) Should the GHG emissions disclosure be included in a note to the registrant’s
financial statements (e.g., in the note where the proposed financial statement
metrics as discussed above in Section II.F would be included) or in a schedule, or
somewhere else? If the GHG emissions disclosure was required in the financial
statements, should it be subject to a reasonable assurance audit like the other
information in the financial statements? If in a schedule, should the GHG
emissions disclosure be disclosed in a schedule similar to those required under
Article 12 of Regulation S-X, which would subject the disclosure to audit and
ICFR requirements? Should we instead require the metrics to be disclosed as
supplemental financial information, similar to the disclosure requirements under
FASB ASC Topic 932-235-50-2 for registrants that have significant oil- and gasproducing activities? If so, should such supplemental schedule be subject to ICFR
requirements? Instead of requiring the GHG emissions disclosure to be included
238
in a note to the registrant’s audited financial statements, should we require a new
financial statement for such metrics?
(c) PCAOB auditing standards apply to the audit of a registrant’s financial statements.
If GHG emissions disclosure is included in a supplemental schedule to the
financial statements, should we allow other auditing standards to be applied? If so,
which ones? What, if any, additional guidance or revisions to such standards
would be needed in order to apply them to the audit of GHG emissions disclosure?
(d) What are the costs and benefits of employing registered public accounting firms to
perform audits of GHG emissions disclosure and related attestation of internal
controls? Are there potential cost savings in employing registered public
accountants that currently perform audits of financial statements and attestation of
ICFR to review GHG emissions disclosure and any related internal controls? If we
require GHG emissions disclosure to be presented in the financial statements,
should we permit entities other than registered public accounting firms to provide
assurance of this information, as proposed for the current attestation requirements
under Regulation S-K? If not limited to registered public accounting firms, who
should be permitted to provide assurance of GHG emissions disclosure? Should we
permit environmental consultants, engineering firms, or other types of specialists
to provide assurance? What are the costs and benefits of such approach? Would
the reliability of the audits and therefore the information disclosed be affected if
assurance providers other than registered public accounting firms are permitted to
conduct these audits? Please provide supporting data where possible. If we should
allow for assurance providers that are not registered public accounting firms, what
239
qualifications and oversight should they have, and what requirements should we
impose on them? Should we direct the PCAOB to develop a separate registration
process for service providers that are not otherwise registered? What expertise,
independence and quality control standards should apply?
(e) What would be the other potential benefits and costs of such an approach?
2. GHG Emissions Attestation Provider Requirements
The proposed rules would require the GHG emissions attestation report required by
proposed Item 1505(a) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to be prepared and
signed by a GHG emissions attestation provider.608
 The proposed rules would define a GHG
emissions attestation provider to mean a person or a firm that has all of the following
characteristics:
• Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in measuring,
analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means
having sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:
o perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal
and regulatory requirements; and
o enable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the
circumstances.
609
608 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b).
609 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(1).
240
• Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates,610 for whom it is
providing the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement
period.
611
The proposed expertise requirement is intended to help ensure that the service provider
preparing the attestation report has sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute
the attestation engagement. In this regard, if the service provider is a firm, we would expect that
it have policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that the
personnel selected to conduct the GHG emissions attestation engagement have significant
experience with respect to both attestation engagements and GHG disclosure. This would mean
that the service provider has the qualifications necessary for fulfillment of the responsibilities
that it would be called on to assume, including the appropriate engagement of specialists, if
needed.612
 The proposed expertise requirement would apply to the person or the firm signing the
GHG emissions attestation report.613

610 “Affiliates,” for purposes of proposed 17 CFR 229.1505 has the meaning provided in 17 CFR 210.2-01, except
references to “audit” are deemed to be references to the attestation services provided pursuant to this section.
See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(iii).
611 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2) and 229.1505(b)(2)(iv) (defining the term “attestation and professional
engagement period”).
612 Independent auditors and accountants are already required to comply with similar quality control and
management standards when providing audit and attest services under the PCAOB, AICPA, or IAASB
standards. See, e.g., PCAOB, Quality Control (QC) Standards Section 20 System of Quality Control for a CPA
Firm’s Accounting and Auditing Practice and Section 40 The Personnel Management Element of a Firm’s
System of Quality Control – Competencies Required by a Practitioner-in-Charge of an Attest Engagement,
available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/qc-standards; AICPA, QC Section 10, A Firm’s System of
Quality Control, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/
downloadabledocuments/qc-00010.pdf; and IAASB, International Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality
Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related
Services Engagements, available at https://www.ifac.org/system/files/publications/files/IAASB-QualityManagement-ISQM-1-Quality-Management-for-Firms.pdf.
613 We have adopted similar expertise requirements in the past to determine eligibility to prepare a mining technical
report. Although also relating to technical, specialized disclosures, the mining technical report requirements
differ in that such an engagement is not an assurance engagement. See Modernization of Property Disclosures
for Mining Registrants, Release No. 33-10570 (Oct. 31, 2018), [83 FR 66344 (Dec. 26, 2018)].
241
The second proposed requirement is modeled on the Commission’s qualifications for
accountants under 17 CFR 210.2-01 (Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X), which are designed to
ensure that auditors are independent of their audit clients. Similar to how assurance provided by
independent public accountants improves the reliability of financial statements and disclosures
and is a critical component of our capital markets, assurance of GHG emissions disclosure by
independent service providers should also improve the reliability of such disclosure. Academic
studies demonstrate that assurance provided by an independent auditor reduces the risk that an
entity provides materially inaccurate information to external parties, including investors, by
facilitating the dissemination of transparent and reliable financial information.614
 We expect that
GHG emissions disclosure would similarly benefit if assured by an independent service provider.
Moreover, the potential conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts of interest,
between the GHG emissions attestation provider and the registrant could raise doubts for
investors about whether they can rely on the attestation service and its report.
Similar to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,615 the proposed rules would provide that a GHG
emissions attestation provider is not independent if during the attestation and professional
engagement period such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of
all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable
of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation
614 See Mark Defond & Jieying Zhang, A Review of Archival Auditing Research, 58 J. ACCT. & ECON., 275 (2014);
Qualifications of Accountants, Release No. 33-10876 (Oct. 16, 2020) [85 FR 80508 (Dec. 11, 2020)], at 80508
(“The Commission has long recognized that an audit by an objective, impartial, and skilled professional
contributes to both investor protection and investor confidence”). See also Statement of Paul Munter, Acting
Chief Accountant, The Importance of High Quality Independent Audits and Effective Audit Committee
Oversight to High Quality Financial Reporting to Investors (Oct. 26, 2021).
615 See 17 CFR 210.2-01(b).
242
provider’s engagement.616
 The proposed definition for the attestation and professional
engagement period, which is modeled on Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, includes both (1) the
period covered by the attestation report and (2) the period of the engagement to attest to the
registrant’s GHG emissions or to prepare a report filed with the Commission (the “professional
engagement period”). Under the proposed rules, the professional engagement period would
begin when the GHG attestation service provider either signs an initial engagement letter (or
other agreement to attest to a registrant’s GHG emissions) or begins attest procedures, whichever
is earlier.617

The proposed rules would further state that, in determining whether a GHG emissions
attestation provider is independent, the Commission will consider:
• whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting interest
between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), places the
attestation provider in the position of attesting to such attestation provider’s own work,
results in the attestation provider acting as management or an employee of the registrant
(or any of its affiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position of being an
advocate for the registrant (or any of its affiliates);618 and
• all relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the
attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those relating
to reports filed with the Commission.619
616 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(i).
617 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(iv).
618 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(ii)(A).
619 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(b)(2)(ii)(B).
243
These proposed provisions are modeled on the factors used by the Commission in
determining whether an accountant is independent.620
 Similar to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,
the proposed provisions should help protect investors by requiring the GHG emissions attestation
provider to be independent both in fact and appearance from the registrant, including its
affiliates.
Because the GHG emissions attestation provider would be a person whose profession
gives authority to the statements made in the attestation report and who is named as having
provided an attestation report that is part of the registration statement, the registrant would be
required to obtain and include the written consent of the GHG emissions attestation provider
pursuant to Securities Act Section 7,621 the corresponding rule requiring the written consents of
such experts,622 and the Regulation S-K provision requiring the attachment of the written consent
of an expert to a Securities Act registration statement or an Exchange Act report that
incorporates by reference a written expert report attached to a previously filed Securities Act
registration statement.623
 The GHG emissions attestation provider would also be subject to
liability under the federal securities laws for the attestation conclusion or, when applicable,
opinion provided. Such liability should encourage the attestation service provider to exercise
due diligence with respect to its obligations under a limited or reasonable assurance engagement.
620 See 17 CFR 210.2-01. For the avoidance of doubt, we note that if the independent accountant who audits the
registrant’s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation for the
same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered “AuditRelated Fees” for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a-101, Item 14 of Form 10-K, Item 16C of Form 20-
F, or any similar requirements.
621 15 U.S.C. 77g.
622 See 17 CFR 230.436.
623 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(23).
244
Request for Comment
144. Should we require a registrant to obtain a GHG emissions attestation report that is
provided by a GHG emissions attestation provider that meets specified requirements, as
proposed? Should one of the requirements be that the attestation provider is an expert in GHG
emissions, with significant experience in measuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG
emissions, as proposed? Should we specify that significant experience means having sufficient
competence and capabilities necessary to: (a) perform engagements in accordance with
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and (b) enable the
service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the circumstances, as proposed?
Should we instead require that the GHG emissions attestation provider have a specified number
of years of the requisite type of experience, such as 1, 3, 5, or more years? Should we specify
that a GHG emissions attestation provider meets the expertise requirements if it is a member in
good standing of a specified accreditation body that provides oversight to service providers that
apply attestation standards? If so, which accreditation body or bodies should we consider (e.g.,
AICPA)? Are there any other requirements for the attestation provider that we should specify?
Instead, should we require a GHG emissions attestation provider to be a PCAOB-registered audit
firm?
145. Is additional guidance needed with respect to the proposed expertise requirement?
Should we instead include prescriptive requirements related to the qualifications and
characteristics of an expert under the proposed rules? For example, should we include a
provision that requires a GHG emissions attestation provider that is a firm to have established
policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that the personnel
selected to provide the GHG attestation service have the qualifications necessary for fulfillment
245
of the responsibilities that the GHG emissions attestation provider will be called on to assume,
including the appropriate engagement of specialists, if needed?
146. Should we require the GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with
respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is providing the attestation report,
as proposed? Should we specify that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if
such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and
circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising
objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation provider’s
engagement, as proposed? The proposed provision is based on a similar provision regarding the
qualification of an accountant to be an independent auditor under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.
Is Rule 2-01 an appropriate model for determining the independence of a GHG emissions
attestation provider? Is being independent from a registrant and its affiliates an appropriate
qualification for a GHG emissions attestation provider?
147. Should we specify that the factors the Commission would consider in determining
whether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent include whether a relationship or
the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the attestation provider
and the registrant, including its affiliates, places the attestation provider in the position of
attesting to such attestation provider’s own work, results in the attestation provider acting as
management or an employee of the registrant, including its affiliates, or places the attestation
provider in a position of being an advocate for the registrant and its affiliates, as proposed?
Should we specify that the Commission also will consider all relevant circumstances, including
all financial and other relationships between the attestation provider and the registrant, including
its affiliates, and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission, as proposed?
246
148. Should we adopt all of the proposed factors for determining the independence of a GHG
emissions attestation provider, or are there factors we should omit? Are there any additional
factors that we should specify that the Commission will consider when determining the
independence of a GHG emissions attestation provider? For example, should we include any
non-exclusive specifications of circumstances that would be inconsistent with the independence
requirements, similar to those provided in 17 CFR 210.2-01(c) (Rule 2-01(c) of Regulation SX)?
149. Should the definition of “affiliates” be modeled on Rule 2-01, as proposed, or should we
use a different definition? Would defining the term differently than proposed cause confusion
because the rest of the proposed independence requirement is modeled on Rule 2-01? Many
accountants are likely familiar with the proposed definition given their required compliance with
Rule 2-01, would non-accountants understand how to comply with and apply this concept?
150. Should the term “attestation and professional engagement period” be defined in the
proposed manner? If not, how should “attestation and professional engagement period” be
defined? Alternatively, should the Commission specify a different time period during which an
attestation provider must meet the proposed independence requirements?
151. Should we include disclosure requirements when there is a change in, or disagreement
with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider that are similar to the disclosure
requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8-K and 17 CFR 229.304 (Item 304 of Regulation S-K)?
152. Accountants are already required to comply with the relevant quality control and
management standards when providing audit and attest services under the PCAOB, AICPA, or
IAASB standards. These quality control and management standards would apply to accountants
providing GHG attestation services pursuant to those standards as well. Should we require the
247
GHG emissions attestation provider to comply with additional minimum quality control
requirements (e.g., acceptance and continuance of engagements, engagement performance,
professional code of conduct, and ethical requirements) to provide greater consistency over the
quality of service provided by GHG emissions attestation providers who do not (or cannot) use
the PCAOB, AICPA, or IAASB attestation standards? If so, what should the minimum
requirements be?
153. As proposed, the GHG emissions attestation provider would be a person whose
profession gives authority to statements made in the attestation report and who is named as
having provided an attestation report that is part of the registration statement, and therefore the
registrant would be required to obtain and include the written consent of the GHG emissions
provider pursuant to Securities Act Section 7 and related Commission rules. This would subject
the GHG emissions attestation provider to potential liability under Section 11 of the Securities
Act. Would the possibility of Section 11 liability deter qualified persons from serving as GHG
emissions attestation providers? Should we include a provision similar to 17 CFR 230.436(c), or
amend that rule, to provide that a report on GHG emissions at the limited assurance level by a
GHG emissions attestation provider that has reviewed such information is not considered part of
a registration statement prepared or certified by a person whose profession gives authority to a
statement made by him or a report prepared or certified by such person within the meaning of
Section 7 and 11 of the Act?
3. GHG Emissions Attestation Engagement and Report Requirements
The proposed rules would require the attestation report required by proposed Item
1505(a) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to be included in the separatelycaptioned “Climate-Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing and provided pursuant to
248
standards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a body or group that has
followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public
comment.624
 The requirement that the standards be established by a body or group that has
followed due process procedures would be similar to the requirements for determining a suitable,
recognized control framework for use in management’s evaluation of an issuer’s ICFR.625
 In
both cases, a specific framework is not prescribed but minimum requirements for what
constitutes a suitable framework are provided. This approach would help to ensure that the
standards upon which the attestation engagement and report are based are the result of a
transparent, public, and reasoned process. This requirement should also help to protect investors
who may rely on the attestation report by limiting the standards to those that have been
sufficiently developed. Rather than prescribe a particular attestation standard, the proposed
approach recognizes that more than one suitable attestation standard exists and that others may
develop in the future.
624 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2) and (c).
625 See 17 CFR 240.13a-15(c) and 240.15d-15(c) (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation
of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control
framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due-process procedures, including the broad
distribution of the framework for public comment”).
249
In our view, the attestation standards, for example, of the PCAOB,626 AICPA,627 and
IAASB628 would meet this due process requirement. In addition, all of these attestation
standards are publicly available at no cost to investors who desire to review them. We believe
that open access is an important consideration when determining the suitability of attestation
standards for application to GHG emissions disclosure because it would enable investors to
evaluate the report against the requirements of the selected attestation standard. By highlighting
these standards, we do not mean to imply that other standards currently used in voluntary
reporting would not be suitable for use under the proposed rules. Our proposal intends to set
minimum standards while acknowledging the current voluntary practices of registrants. As
noted below, we seek comment on whether other standards currently used in the voluntary
climate-related assurance market or that are otherwise under development would meet the
proposed due process requirement and also be suitable for application to GHG emissions under
the Commission’s proposed rules.
The proposed rules would not include any requirement for a registrant to obtain an
attestation report covering the effectiveness of internal control over GHG emissions disclosure,
626 See PCAOB AT Section 101, Attest Engagements, available at
https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/attestation-standards/details/AT101.
627 See AICPA SSAE No. 18 (general attestation standard), available at

250
and therefore such a report would not be required even when the GHG emissions attestation
engagement is performed at a reasonable assurance level. Given the current evolving state of
GHG emissions reporting and assurance, we believe that existing DCP obligations, and the
proposed requirement that accelerated filers and large accelerated filers initially obtain at least
limited assurance of such disclosure, are appropriate first steps toward enhancing the reliability
of GHG emissions disclosure. We also note that, under prevailing attestation standards for
limited assurance engagements, the testing of and attestation over internal controls are not
required.
629
 With respect to the eventual reasonable assurance engagements, while there are
requirements under prevailing attestation standards to consider and obtain an understanding of
internal controls, there is no required attestation of the effectiveness of internal controls such as
that included in Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act).
630
We recognize that the attestation standards that a GHG emissions attestation provider
may use would have specific requirements for the form and content of attestation reports. The
proposed rules would require a GHG emissions attestation provider to follow the specific
requirements regarding form and content of the reports set forth by the attestation standard (or
standards) used by such attestation provider.631 Nevertheless, in order to provide some
standardization and comparability of GHG emissions attestation reports, the proposed rules
would impose minimum requirements for the GHG emissions attestation report.632
 In particular,
such minimum report requirements would provide investors with consistent and comparable
629 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C § 210.A16.
630 See 15 U.S.C. 7262(b) (requiring a registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues an audit report for
certain issuers to attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the management of the issuer with respect to
internal controls).

251
information about the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report obtained by the
registrant when the engagement is conducted by a GHG emissions attestation provider using an
attestation standard that may be less widely used or that has less robust report requirements than
more prevalent standards.
The proposed minimum attestation engagement and report requirements are primarily
derived from the AICPA’s attestation standards (e.g., SSAE No. 18), which are commonly used
by accountants who currently provide GHG attestation engagement services as well as other nonGHG-related attestation engagement services, and are largely similar to the report requirements
under PCAOB AT-101 and IAASB ISAE 3410. Many of the following proposed minimum
attestation report requirements are also elements of an accountant’s report when attesting to
internal control over financial reporting, of an accountant’s report on audited financial statements
(which is conducted at a reasonable assurance level), or of a review report on interim financial
statements (which is conducted at a limited assurance level). We explain below each of the
proposed minimum components of a GHG emissions attestation report. These are all common
elements of current assurance reports and are also similar to elements of other expert reports and
legal opinions provided in Commission filings and other transactions.
As proposed, the GHG emissions attestation report would be required to include an
identification or description of the subject matter or assertion on which the attestation provider is
reporting.633
 For example, the attestation report would identify the subject matter as Scope 1 and
Scope 2 emissions disclosure. If a registrant voluntarily sought attestation of additional items of
disclosure, such as GHG intensity metrics or Scope 3 emissions, the attestation provider would
633 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1).
252
be required to identify those additional items as well in the attestation report. If a registrant has
made an assertion about the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter to the attestation
provider,634 the attestation report must include such assertion. For example, the attestation report
might refer to the registrant’s assertion that the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure
included within the filing has been presented in accordance with Item 1504 of Regulation S-K.
These proposed minimum requirements would elicit information that is fundamental to
understanding the attestation report and would clarify the scope of the attestation report when the
scope does not align with the scope of the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure (e.g., when
Scope 3 emissions disclosure is included in the filing but not covered by the attestation report).
The proposed rules would also require the GHG emissions attestation report to include
the point in time or period of time to which the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter
or assertion relates.
635
 Therefore, the attestation provider would be required to identify the time
period to which the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure (or other additional disclosure) relates,
which would be the registrant’s most recently completed fiscal year or some other 12-month
period if permitted under the applicable climate-related disclosure rules636 as well as any relevant
historical period disclosure included within the filing. This proposed requirement seeks to avoid
any confusion investors may have about which period or periods of the climate-related
disclosures included within the filing are subject to the attestation.
634 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C §210.45(c); AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C §205.63(c).
635 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(1).
636 As previously mentioned, we are soliciting comment regarding whether the GHG emissions should be reported
as of fiscal year-end or some other 12-month period. See supra Section II.G.1.
253
The proposed rules would also require the attestation report to identify the criteria against
which the subject matter was measured or evaluated.
637
 For an attestation report solely covering
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, the identified criteria would include the requirements in
proposed Item 1504 of Regulation S-K and, in particular, Item 1504(a), which includes
presentation requirements such as disaggregation by each constituent greenhouse gas. The
identified criteria would also include Item 1504(b) and the applicable instructions in Item
1504(e) regarding methodology, organizational boundary, and operational boundary. In other
words, this minimum requirement would require an attestation provider to refer to the
requirements with which the registrant must comply when making the disclosure that is subject
to the attestation. Without the frame of reference provided by the identified criteria, the
conclusion or opinion included in the report may be open to individual interpretation and
misunderstanding by investors.
Prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is
measured or evaluated to be “suitable.” In the context of the proposed rules, suitable criteria
would, when followed, result in reasonably consistent measurement or evaluation of the
registrant’s disclosure that is within the scope of the engagement. Characteristics of suitable
criteria include relevance, objectivity, measurability, and completeness.638
 We believe that
proposed Item 1504 of Regulation S-K would satisfy the suitable criteria requirements of the
prevailing attestation standards because the proposed requirements set forth relevant, objective
637 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(2).
638 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C §105.A16 and .A42; AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C §105.A16 and .A44.
In addition to relevance and completeness, the characteristics of suitable criteria under ISAE 3000.A23 include
reliability, neutrality and understandability. Despite the differences in the characteristics listed, the underlying
concepts and objectives are consistent.
254
standards that call for measurable and complete disclosure of GHG emissions that would allow
for a consistent evaluation of the registrant’s disclosure.
The GHG emissions attestation report would further be required to include a statement
that identifies the level of assurance provided and describes the nature of the attestation
engagement.
639
 For example, under the proposed rule, an attestation report providing limited
assurance would need to include not only a statement that limited assurance is the provided level
of assurance, but also would need to describe the scope of work performed in a limited assurance
engagement, which typically would indicate that the procedures performed vary in nature,
timing, and extent compared to a reasonable assurance engagement. This proposed minimum
requirement would help investors understand the level of assurance provided.
The proposed rules would require the attestation report to include a statement that
identifies the attestation standard (or standards) used.
640
 As previously discussed, the standard
used must be publicly available at no cost and have been established by a body or group that has
followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public
comment.641
 This minimum report requirement would allow investors to easily identify the
attestation standard that the engagement is executed against, which is particularly important
because the proposed rules do not prescribe a particular attestation standard. Understanding the
attestation standard used would allow investors to better understand the attestation performed by
evaluating the report against the attestation standard’s requirements and would facilitate
comparability across the attestation reports of different registrants.
639 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(3).
640 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(4).
641 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2).
255
The attestation report would also be required to include a statement that describes the
registrant’s responsibility to report on the subject matter or assertion being reported on in order
to make it clear to investors who is ultimately responsible for the disclosure.642
 At a minimum,
this proposed provision would require a statement that the registrant is responsible for the subject
matter, or its assertion on the subject matter. This proposed requirement, like all of the minimum
requirements, has corollaries outside of the GHG emissions context. For example, an
independent auditor’s audit report on a registrant’s financial statements is required to include a
statement that the registrant’s management is responsible for the financial statements that are
being audited.643
The proposed rules would further require the attestation report to include a statement that
describes the attestation provider’s responsibilities in connection with the preparation of the
attestation report.
644
 This is consistent with existing requirements in reports such as those issued
by the independent auditor on the audited financial statements or a review report on the interim
financial statements. For example, with respect to a limited assurance engagement, under
prevailing attestation standards, the report would typically include a statement that the attestation
provider’s responsibilities include expressing a conclusion on the subject matter or the assertion
based on the attestation provider’s review.645
 Similarly, for a reasonable assurance engagement,
the report would typically include a statement that the attestation provider’s responsibilities
642 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(5).
643 See, e.g., PCAOB AS 3101, par. 9(a).
644 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(6).
645 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No.22, AT-C sec. 210.45(f).
256
include expressing an opinion on the subject matter or assertion, based on the attestation
provider’s examination.646
The proposed rules would also require the attestation report to include a statement that
the attestation provider is independent, as required by proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a).
647
 Because
independence from the registrant, including its affiliates, would be a necessary qualification for
the GHG emissions attestation provider,648 the attestation report would be required to include the
attestation provider’s confirmation of his or her compliance with the proposed independence
requirement.
The proposed rules would further require the attestation report, for a limited assurance
engagement, to include a description of the work performed as a basis for the attestation
provider’s conclusion.649
 This proposed provision is intended to enhance the transparency of the
GHG emissions attestation report for investors by eliciting disclosure about the procedures
undertaken by the attestation provider in its limited assurance engagement, such as inquiries and
analytical procedures. This information would allow investors to assess and understand the
extent of procedures performed to support the conclusion reached by the attestation provider,
which could also facilitate an investor’s comparison of different attestation reports provided
under the same or different attestation standards.
The GHG emissions attestation report would also be required to include a statement that
describes any significant inherent limitations associated with the measurement or evaluation of
646 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT-C sec. 205.63(f) and sec. 206.12(e)(ii).
647 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(7).
648 See supra Section II.H.2.
649 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(8).
257
the subject matter (at a minimum, Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) against the criteria (i.e., the
applicable requirements in proposed Item 1504).650
 Such a statement is a common characteristic
of attestation reports, including the independent auditor’s report on internal control over financial
reporting. This proposed provision is intended to elicit disclosure about the estimation
uncertainties inherent in the quantification of GHG emissions, driven by reasons such as the state
of the science, methodology, and assumptions used in the measurement and reporting processes.
For example, an attestation provider might include in its report a statement about measurement
uncertainty resulting from accuracy and precision of GHG emission conversion factors.
The proposed rules would require the GHG emissions attestation report to include the
attestation provider’s conclusion or opinion, as applicable, based on the attestation standard(s)
used.651
 For a limited assurance engagement, under prevailing attestation standards, the
conclusion would typically state whether the provider is aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the subject matter in order for the disclosure to be in accordance with (or
based on) the requirements specified in Item 1504, or for the registrant’s assertion about such
subject matter to be fairly stated.652
 For a reasonable assurance engagement, the attestation
provider would typically provide an opinion on whether the subject matter is in accordance with
(or based on) the requirements specified in Item 1504 in all material respects, or that the
registrant’s assertion about its subject matter is fairly stated, in all material respects.
653
650 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(9).
651 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(10).
652 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT-C sec. 210.45(l).
653 See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 21 AT-C sec. 205.63(k) and sec. 206.12(j).
258
Finally, the proposed rules would require the GHG emissions attestation report to include
the signature of the attestation provider (whether by an individual or a person signing on behalf
of the attestation provider’s firm),654 the city and state where the attestation report has been
issued,
655 and the date of the report.656
 These are all common elements of current assurance and
expert reports, and each of these proposed provisions would help to identify and confirm the
validity of the GHG emissions attestation provider.
Request for Comment
154. Should we require the attestation engagement and related attestation report to be
provided pursuant to standards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a
body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the
framework for public comment, as proposed? Is the requirement of “due process procedures,
including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment” sufficiently clear?
Would the attestation standards of the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB meet this due process
requirement? Are there other standards currently used in the voluntary climate-related assurance
market or otherwise in development that would meet the due process and publicly availability
requirements? For example, would verification standards commonly used by non-accountants
currently, such as ISO 14064-3 and the AccountAbility’s AA1000 Series of Standards, meet the
proposed requirements? Are there standards currently used in the voluntary climate-related
assurance market or otherwise under development that would be appropriate for use under the
Commission’s climate-related disclosure rules although they may not strictly meet the proposed
654 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(11).
655 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(12).
656 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(c)(13).
259
public comment requirement? If so, please explain whether those standards have other
characteristics that would serve to protect investors?
155. Should we require that the attestation standards used be publicly available at no cost to
investors, as proposed? Should we permit the use of attestation standards, even if not publicly
available at no cost, provided that registrants provide access to those standards at the request of
their investors?
156. Should we require the GHG emissions attestation report to meet certain minimum
requirements in addition to any form and content requirements set forth by the attestation
standard or standards used by the GHG emissions attestation provider, as proposed? Should we
instead require that the attestation report solely meet whatever requirements are established by
the attestation standard or standards used?
157. Should we adopt each of the proposed minimum requirements? Are there any proposed
requirements that we should omit or add to the proposed list of minimum GHG emissions
attestation report requirements?
158. Regarding the proposed provision requiring the identification of the criteria against
which the subject matter was measured or evaluated, would reference to proposed Item 1504(a),
Item 1504(b), and Item 1504(e)’s instructions concerning the presentation, methodology,
including underlying assumptions, and organizational and operational boundaries applicable to
the determination of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under
prevailing attestation standards (e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT-C 105.A16)?
159. If we require or permit a registrant to use the GHG Protocol as the methodology for
determining GHG emissions, would the provisions of the GHG Protocol qualify as “suitable
criteria” against which the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated?
260
4. Additional Disclosure by the Registrant
In addition to the minimum attestation report requirements described above, which reflect
the contents of attestation reports under prevailing attestation standards, we are proposing to
require disclosure by the registrant of certain additional matters related to the attestation of a
registrant’s GHG emissions.657
 These disclosures are not typically included in an attestation
report, and would not be included in the GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed
rules. Instead, the registrant would be required to provide these disclosures in the separately
captioned “Climate-Related Disclosure” section, where the GHG emissions disclosure would be
provided pursuant to the proposed rules.658

These proposed additional disclosures should assist investors in evaluating the
qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider selected by the registrant, particularly in
light of the broad spectrum of attestation providers that would be permitted to provide an
attestation report under the proposed rules.659
We considered requiring the proposed disclosures to be provided in the attestation report
but are not proposing to do so because we are concerned such an approach may create confusion
by conflicting with prevalent attestation standards. Furthermore, in light of the variety of
attestation service providers the registrant is permitted to engage, requiring the registrant to
provide such disclosures may allow the registrant to better provide its investors with relevant
information about the qualifications of the service provider that the registrant engaged for the
GHG emissions attestation.
657 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d).
658 See id.
659 See supra Section II.H.2.
261
With respect to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions attestation required pursuant to
proposed Item 1505(a) for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers,660 the registrant would
be required to disclose in the filing, based on relevant information obtained from any GHG
emissions attestation provider:
• Whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to
provide assurance, and if so, the identity of the licensing or accreditation body, and
whether the attestation provider is a member in good standing of that licensing or
accreditation body;661
• Whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight
inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs);662 and
• Whether the attestation provider is subject to record-keeping requirements with respect to
the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement and, if so, identify the
record-keeping requirements and the duration of those requirements.663
The first two above items of disclosure would help investors better understand the
qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn could help them assess
the reliability of the attestation results. An example of a license from a licensing or accreditation
body to provide assurance would be a Certified Public Accountant license issued by a state board
of accountancy (e.g., the California Board of Accountancy), while an example of oversight
programs would include the AICPA peer review program, among others. The proposed
660 If an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer voluntarily obtains assurance beyond what would be required
by proposed Item 1505(a) and uses a different service provider for such assurance, it would also be required to
provide the information required by proposed Item 1505(d) for such service provider.
661 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d)(1).
662 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d)(2).
663 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(d)(3).
262
disclosure requirement about any record-keeping requirements to which the attestation provider
is subject would help enhance the transparency of the attestation process by providing investors
with information about the business practices of the attestation provider that has been retained by
the registrant.664

Request for Comment
160. Should we require certain items of disclosure related to the attestation of a registrant’s
GHG emissions to be provided by the registrant in its filing that includes the attestation report
(where the GHG emissions and other climate-related disclosures are presented), based on
relevant information obtained from the GHG emissions attestation provider, as proposed?
Should these additional items of disclosure instead be included in the attestation report?
161. Should we require the registrant to disclose whether the attestation provider has a
license from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance, and if so, the identity of
the licensing or accreditation body, and whether the attestation provider is a member in good
standing of that licensing or accreditation body, as proposed? In lieu of disclosure, should we
require a GHG emissions attestation provider to be licensed to provide assurance by specified
licensing or accreditation bodies? If so, which licensing or accreditation bodies should we
specify?
162. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation
engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or
programs), as proposed? Should we instead require the registrant to disclose whether the
664 For example, the AICPA imposes a minimum five-year documentation retention program for an audit. See AUC 230.17. Although document retention is less prescriptive for attestation engagements, many attestation
providers adhere to the five-year period in practice.
263
attestation engagement is subject to certain specified oversight programs? If so, which oversight
programs should we specify?
163. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether the attestation provider is subject to
record-keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions
attestation engagement and, if so, identify the record-keeping requirements and duration of those
requirements, as proposed? In lieu of disclosure, should we specify that the record-keeping
requirements of a GHG emissions attestation provider must be of a certain minimum duration,
such as three, five, or seven years, or some other period? Should we specify that the recordkeeping requirements must include certain reasonable procedures and, if so, what procedures?
5. Disclosure of Voluntary Attestation
Because GHG emissions reporting and assurance landscapes are both relatively new and
evolving as described earlier, at this time, we are proposing to require a registrant, other than a
large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer that is required to include a GHG emissions
attestation report pursuant to proposed Item 1505(a), to disclose within the separately captioned
“Climate-Related Disclosure” section in the filing the following information if the registrant’s
GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third-party attestation or verification:
(i) Identify the provider of such assurance or verification;665
(ii) Describe the assurance or verification standard used;666
(iii) Describe the level and scope of assurance or verification provided;667
665 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(e)(1).
666 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(e)(2).
667 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(e)(3).
264
(iv) Briefly describe the results of the assurance or verification;668
(v) Disclose whether the third-party service provider has any other business
relationships with or has provided any other professional services to the
registrant that may lead to an impairment of the service provider’s
independence with respect to the registrant;669 and
(vi) Disclose any oversight inspection program to which the service provider is
subject (e.g., the AICPA’s peer review program).670
Taken together, these proposed disclosure items should help investors understand the
nature and reliability of the attestation or verification provided and help them assess whether the
voluntary assurance or verification has enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure.
We are limiting the proposed assurance disclosure requirement to a registrant’s GHG emissions
disclosure because registrants are more likely to obtain assurance voluntarily for this disclosure
item than for other climate-related disclosures.671
 The proposed approach should mitigate the
compliance burden of the proposed GHG emissions disclosure rules, taking into consideration
the proportionate compliance costs that may impact accelerated and large accelerated filers
versus other types of filers, while providing transparency for investors about the level and
reliability of the assurance or verification, if any, provided on the GHG emissions disclosures.

Reporting.
265
164. Should we require a registrant that is not required to include a GHG emissions
attestation report pursuant to proposed Item 1505(a) to disclose within the separately captioned
“Climate-Related Disclosure” section in the filing the following information, if the registrant’s
GHG emissions disclosure was subject to third-party attestation or verification, as proposed:
(i) Identify the provider of such assurance or verification;
(ii) Disclose the assurance or verification standard used;
(iii) Describe the level and scope of assurance or verification provided;
(iv) Briefly describe the results of the assurance or verification;
(v) Disclose whether the third-party service provider has any other business
relationships with or has provided any other professional services to the registrant that
may lead to an impairment of the service provider’s independence with respect to the
registrant; and
(vi) Disclose any oversight inspection program to which the service provider is subject
(e.g., the AICPA’s peer review program), each as proposed?
Are there other disclosure items that we should require if a registrant has obtained voluntary
assurance or verification of the climate-related disclosures? Are there any of the proposed
disclosure items that we should omit? Should we specify parameters or include guidance on
when the services provided by a third-party would be considered “assurance” or “verification”
and thus require disclosure pursuant to the proposed rules? Should a registrant be required to
furnish a copy of or provide a link to the assurance or verification report so that it is readily
accessible by an investor?
165. Instead of requiring a registrant to disclose whether the third-party service provider has
any other business relationships with or has provided any other professional services to the
266
registrant that may lead to an impairment of the service provider’s independence with respect to
the registrant as proposed, should we require the third-party service provider to be independent,
according to the standard proposed under Item 1505(b) for accelerated filers and large
accelerated filers that are required to include a GHG emissions attestation report pursuant to
proposed Item 1505(a)? If not, should we provide guidance as to what constitutes an impairment
of a service provider’s independence with respect to the registrant? Would this result in
decision-useful information to an investor? Should we instead require a registrant to disclose
whether the third-party service provider would be considered independent under some other
independence requirement?
166. As proposed, a registrant would be required to disclose any oversight inspection
program to which the service provider is subject, such as the PCAOB’s inspection program or
the AICPA’s peer review program. Are there other oversight programs that we should provide
as examples? Would such disclosure provide decision-useful information to an investor? Is it
clear what “any oversight inspection program” would include?
167. As proposed, a registrant would not be required to disclose the voluntary assurance or
verification fees associated with the GHG disclosures. Should we require GHG disclosure
assurance or verification fees to be disclosed? Would such disclosure be decision-useful to
investors making voting or investment decisions?
I. Targets and Goals Disclosure
If a registrant has set any climate-related targets or goals, then the proposed rules would
require the registrant to provide certain information about those targets or goals.
672
 Those goals
672 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1).
267
or targets might, for example, relate to the reduction of GHG emissions, or address energy
usage,673 water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration. A registrant might also set goals
with regard to revenues from low-carbon products in line with anticipated regulatory
requirements, market constraints, or other goals established by a climate-related treaty, law,
regulation, policy, or organization. The proposed disclosure requirements could help investors
better understand the scope of a registrant’s climate-related targets or goals, including those
related to GHG emissions, and assist in assessing progress towards achieving those targets or
goals.
Many commenters recommended that we require registrants to provide detailed
information about their climate-related targets and goals, including action plans and timelines for
achieving such targets as GHG emissions reductions and performance data measured against
those targets.674
 This information could be important for investors in light of the fact that,
according to one publication, two-thirds of S&P 500 companies had set a carbon reduction target
by the end of 2020.675
 Despite the numerous commitments to reduce GHG emissions, according
to several sources, many companies do not provide their investors with sufficient information to
understand how the companies intend to achieve those commitments or the progress made
673 For example, numerous companies have pledged to achieve 100% of the electricity used in their global
operations from renewable sources by 2050. See RE100, What are the requirements to become a RE100
member?, available at https://www.there100.org/technical-guidance.
674 See, e.g., letters from Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and Public Citizen; Center for Law and
Social Policy; Domini Impact Investments; Dynamhex, Inc.; FAIRR Initiative; Generation Investment
Management; Hannon Armstrong; HP, Inc.; Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility; NYC Office of
Comptroller; Pre-Distribution Initiative; Regenerative Crisis Response Committee; and WK Associates.
675 See supra note 66 (referencing The Wall Street Journal (Nov. 5, 2021)).
268
regarding them.676 The proposed disclosure requirements are intended to elicit enhanced
information about climate-related targets and goals so that investors can better evaluate these
points.
If a registrant has set climate-related targets or goals, the proposed rules would require it
to disclose them, including, as applicable, a description of:
• The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;
• The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;
• The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the
time horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty,
law, regulation, policy, or organization;
• The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will be
tracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;
• Any interim targets set by the registrant; and
• How the registrant intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals.
677
This information would help investors understand a registrant’s particular target or goal
and a particular timeline for that target or goal, how the target or goal is to be measured, and how
progress against the target or goal is to be tracked. For example, a registrant might disclose that
it plans to cut its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 50 percent by 2030.678
 The registrant might also
disclose a target to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 50 percent by 2035. In addition, the
676 See, e.g., Jocelyn Timperley, The Guardian, The truth behind corporate climate pledges (July 26, 2021); Peter
Eavis and Clifford Krauss, The New York Times, What’s Really Behind Corporate Promises on Climate
Change? (May 12, 2021); and Alice C. Hill and Jennifer Nash, The Hill, The truth behind companies' 'net zero'
climate commitments (Apr. 9, 2021).

678 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(3).
269
registrant might also set a goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its
operations by 2050, in keeping with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Under the proposed rules, the registrant would be required to disclose the baseline year
for multiple targets.
679
 Requiring disclosure of defined baseline time periods and baseline
emissions against which progress will be tracked, with a consistent base year for multiple targets,
could help investors compare the progress made towards each target. The registrant would also
be required to disclose the unit of measurement, including whether the target is expressed in
absolute terms or is intensity-based. If the registrant has set intervening targets (e.g., reducing its
Scope 3 emissions by 35 percent by 2030), the registrant would be required to disclose these
targets.680
 Each of the proposed disclosure requirements is intended to provide investors with
additional insight into the scope and specifics of a registrant’s climate-related targets or goals.
The proposed rules would further require a registrant to discuss how it intends to meet its
climate-related targets or goals.681
 This information should enable investors to better understand
the potential impacts on a registrant associated with pursuing its climate-related targets or goals.
For example, for a target or goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could
include a strategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase
carbon offsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage.682
 For a registrant
operating in a water-stressed area, with the goal of reducing its freshwater needs, the discussion
could include a strategy to increase the water efficiency of its operations, such as by recycling
679 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(4).
680 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(5).
681 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(6).
682 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(6).
270
wastewater or, if in agriculture, engaging in bioengineering techniques to make crops more
resilient and less water dependent. Information about how a registrant intends to achieve its
climate-related target or goal could provide investors with a better understanding of the potential
costs to mitigate a potential climate-related risk, such as a manufacturer’s reduction of GHG
emissions through implementation of a relatively high cost solution such as carbon capture and
storage technology.
683
The proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose relevant data to indicate
whether it is making progress toward achieving the target or goal and how such progress has
been achieved.684
 A registrant would be required to update this disclosure each fiscal year by
describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or goals.685
 This proposed
disclosure could help investors assess how well a registrant is managing its identified climaterelated risks.
Some companies might establish climate-related goals or targets without yet knowing
how they will achieve those goals. They might plan to develop their strategies over time,
particularly as new technologies become available that might facilitate their achievement of their
goals. The fact that a company has set a goal or target does not mean that it has a specific plan
for how it will achieve those goals. What is important is that investors be informed of a
registrant’s plans and progress wherever it is in the process of developing and implementing its
plan.
683 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1502.
684 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(c).
685 See id.
271
If the registrant has used carbon offsets or RECs in its plan to achieve climate-related
targets or goals, it would be required to disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by
the offsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of
the offsets or RECs, a description and location of the underlying projects, any registries or other
authentication of the offsets or RECs, and the cost of the offsets or RECs.686
 For example, a
carbon offset might pertain to an underlying project to reduce GHG emissions, increase the
storage of carbon, or enhance GHG removals from the atmosphere. Information regarding the
source, value, underlying projects, and authentication of the offsets or RECs could help investors
assess the offsets or RECs and the effectiveness of the registrant’s plan to achieve its climaterelated targets or goals. Such information could also help investors understand changes in the
use or viability of the carbon offsets or RECs as part of achieving a registrant’s climate-related
targets or goals that are caused by changes in regulation or markets. A reasonable investor could
well assess differently the effectiveness and value to a registrant of the use of carbon offsets
where the underlying projects resulted in authenticated reductions in GHG emissions compared
to the use of offsets where the underlying projects resulted in the avoidance, but not the
reduction, in GHG emissions or otherwise lacked verification. As some commenters have
indicated, mandated detailed disclosure about the nature of a purchased carbon offset could also
help to mitigate instances of greenwashing.687
Proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(2) (Item 1505(a)(2)) would state that a registrant may
provide the disclosures required by the section when discussing climate-related impacts on its
strategy, business model, and outlook (in response to proposed Item 1502) or when discussing its
686 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1506(d).
687 See, e.g., letter from Dimensional Fund Advisors.
272
transition plan as part of its risk management disclosure (in response to proposed Item 1503). If
so, it need not repeat the disclosure in response to the proposed targets and goals section but
should cross-refer to the section where the information has been provided.
A registrant’s disclosure of its climate-related targets or goals should not be construed to
be promises or guarantees. To the extent that information regarding a registrant’s climate-related
targets or goals would constitute forward-looking statements, which we would expect, for
example, with respect to how a registrant intends to achieve its climate-related targets or goals
and expected progress regarding those targets and goals, the PSLRA safe harbors would apply to
such statements, assuming all other statutory requirements for those safe harbors are satisfied.
Request for Comment
168. Should we require a registrant to disclose whether it has set any targets related to the
reduction of GHG emissions, as proposed? Should we also require a registrant to disclose
whether it has set any other climate-related target or goal, e.g., regarding energy usage, water
usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration, or revenues from low-carbon products, in line with
anticipated regulatory requirements, market constraints, or other goals, as proposed? Are there
any other climate-related targets or goals that we should specify and, if so, which targets or
goals? Is it clear when disclosure under this proposed item would be triggered, or do we need to
provide additional guidance? Would our proposal discourage registrants from setting such
targets or goals?
169. Should we require a registrant, when disclosing its targets or goals, to disclose:
• The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;
• The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;
273
• The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the
time horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty,
law, regulation, or organization;
• The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will be
tracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;
• Any intervening targets set by the registrant; and
• How it intends to meet its targets or goals, each as proposed?
Are there any other items of information about a registrant’s climate-related targets or
goals that we should require to be disclosed, in addition to or instead of these proposed items?
Are there any proposed items regarding such targets or goals that we should exclude from the
required disclosure? If a registrant has set multiple targets or goals, should it be permitted to
establish different base years for those targets or goals?
170. Should we require a registrant to discuss how it intends to meet its climate-related
targets or goals, as proposed? Should we provide examples of potential items of discussion
about a target or goal regarding GHG emissions reduction, such as a strategy to increase energy
efficiency, a transition to lower carbon products, purchasing carbon offsets or RECs, or engaging
in carbon removal and carbon storage, as proposed? Should we provide additional examples of
items of discussion about climate-related targets or goals and, if so, what items should we add?
Should we remove any of the proposed examples of items of discussion?
171. Should we require a registrant, when disclosing its targets or goals, to disclose any data
that indicates whether the registrant is making progress towards meeting the target and how such
progress has been achieved, as proposed?
274
172. Should we require that the disclosure be provided in any particular format, such as
charts? Would certain formats help investors and others better assess these disclosures in the
context of assessing the registrant’s business and financial condition? What additional or other
requirements would help in this regard?
173. If a registrant has used carbon offsets or RECs, should we require the registrant to
disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by the offsets or the amount of generated
renewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of the offsets or RECs, the nature and
location of the underlying projects, any registries or other authentication of the offsets or RECs,
and the cost of the offsets or RECs, as proposed? Are there other items of information about
carbon offsets or RECs that we should specifically require to be disclosed when a registrant
describes its targets or goals and the related use of offsets or RECs? Are there proposed items of
information that we should exclude from the required disclosure about offsets and RECs?
174. Should we apply the PSLRA statutory safe harbors as they currently exist to forwardlooking statements involving climate-related targets and goals, or other climate-related forwardlooking information? Should we instead create a separate safe harbor for forward-looking
climate-related information, including targets and goals? Should we adopt an exception to the
PSLRA statutory safe harbors that would extend the safe harbors to climate-related forwardlooking disclosures made in an initial public offering registration statement?
275
J. Registrants Subject to the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules and Affected
Forms
The proposed climate-related disclosure rules would apply to a registrant with Exchange
Act reporting obligations pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(a)688 or Section 15(d)689 and
companies filing a Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statement. Specifically, we are
proposing to require a registrant to include climate-related disclosure in Securities Act or
Exchange Act registration statements (Securities Act Forms S-1, F-1, S-3, F-3, S-4, F-4, and S11, and Exchange Act Forms 10 and 20-F)690 and Exchange Act annual reports (Forms 10-K and
20-F), including the proposed financial statement metrics.691
 Similar to the treatment of other
important business and financial information, the proposed rules would also require registrants to
disclose any material change to the climate-related disclosure provided in a registration statement
688 15 U.S.C. 78m(a).
689 15 U.S.C. 78o(d).
690 Form 20-F is the Exchange Act form used by a foreign private issuer for its annual report or to register a class
of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The proposed rules would amend Part I of Form 20-F to
require a foreign private issuer to provide the climate-related disclosures pursuant to the proposed rules either
when registering a class of securities under the Exchange Act or when filing its Exchange Act annual report. A
foreign private issuer would also be required to comply with the proposed rules when filing a Securities Act
registration statement on Form F-1. Because Form F-1 requires a registrant to include the disclosures required
by Part I of Form 20-F, the proposed amendment to Form 20-F would render unnecessary a formal amendment
to Form F-1. We are similarly not formally amending Forms S-3 and F-3 because the climate-related disclosure
would be included in a registrant’s Form 10-K or 20-F annual report that is incorporated by reference into those
Securities Act registration statements.
691 See Form 20-F, General Instruction B(d) (stating that Regulation S-X applies to the presentation of financial
information in the form). Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20-F, and the forms that refer to Form 20-F
(including Forms F-1 and F-3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements prepared in accordance
with IFRS as issued by the IASB, the proposed Article 14 disclosure would nevertheless be required (similar to
disclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S-X). See Acceptance from Foreign Private Issuers of
Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Without
Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, Rel. No. 33-8879 (Dec. 21, 2007) [73 FR 986 (Jan. 4, 2008)], 999, n.136 (stating
that “Regulation S–X will continue to apply to the filings of all foreign private issuers, including those who file
financial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB,” but providing that such issuers “will comply
with IASB requirements for form and content within the financial statements, rather than with the specific
presentation and disclosure provisions in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Regulation S-X”).
276
or annual report in its Form 10-Q (or, in certain circumstances, Form 6-K for a registrant that is a
foreign private issuer that does not report on domestic forms).692
The proposed rules would amend Form 20-F and the Securities Act forms that a foreign
private issuer may use to register the offer and sale of securities under the Securities Act to
require the same climate-related disclosures as proposed for a domestic registrant.693
 Because
climate-related risks potentially impact both domestic and foreign private issuers, regardless of
the registrant’s jurisdiction of origin or organization, requiring that foreign private issuers
provide this disclosure would be important to achieving our goal of more consistent, reliable, and
comparable information across registrants. Moreover, we note that Form 20-F imposes
substantially similar disclosure requirements as those required for Form 10-K filers on matters,
such as risk factors and MD&A, that are similar and relevant to the proposed climate-related
disclosures.694

692 Form 6-K is the form furnished by a foreign private issuer with an Exchange Act reporting obligation if the
issuer: (i) makes or is required to make the information public pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction of its
domicile or in which it is incorporated or organized, or (ii) files or is required to file the information with a
stock exchange on which its securities are traded and which was made public by that exchange, or (iii)
distributes or is required to distribute the information to its security holders. See General Instruction B to Form
6-K. That instruction currently list certain types of information that are required to be furnished pursuant to
subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii), above. While we are proposing to amend Form 6-K to add climate-related
disclosure to the list of the types of information to be provided on Form 6-K, a foreign private issuer would not
be required to provide the climate-related disclosure if such disclosure is not required to be furnished pursuant
to subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii) of General Instruction B.
693 See proposed Item 3.E to Form 20-F.
694 For similar reasons, we believe that requiring the proposed climate disclosures on Forms F-1, F-3, and F-4 is
appropriate because those forms either require the disclosure pursuant to certain parts of Form 20-F (Forms F-1
and F-4) and certain items, such as risk factors, under Regulation S-K, or permit the incorporation by reference
of Form 20-F (Forms F-3 and F-4) and therefore require disclosure similar to the domestic forms.
277
We are not proposing generally to exempt SRCs, EGCs,695 or registrants that are foreign
private issuers from the entire scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules because we
agree with commenters who stated that, because of their broad impact across industries and
jurisdictions, climate-related risks may pose a significant risk to the operations and financial
condition of domestic and foreign issuers, both large and small.696
 While we are not proposing
to exempt SRCs from the full scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules, we are
proposing to exempt SRCs from the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement.
697 We
also are proposing to provide a longer transition period for SRCs to comply with the proposed
rules than we are proposing for other registrants.698
 The proposed accommodations for Scope 3
emissions disclosures could mitigate the proposed rules’ compliance burden for smaller
registrants that, when compared to larger registrants with more resources, may be less able to
afford the fixed costs associated with the reporting of GHG emissions. In addition, the extended
compliance period would give SRCs additional time to allocate the resources necessary to
compile and prepare their climate-related disclosures.
695 An emerging growth company (“EGC”) is a registrant that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07
billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and has not met the specified conditions for no longer
being considered an EGC. See 17 CFR 230.405; 17 CFR 240.12b-2; 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19); 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(80); and Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments under Titles I and II of the JOBS Act,
Release No. 33- 10332 (Mar. 31, 2017) [82 FR 17545 (Apr. 12, 2017)].
696 See, e.g., letters from Rob Bonta, California Attorney General et al.; Ceres et al.; and Natural Resources
Defense Council.
697 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(3). In this regard we note that participants in the Commission-hosted 2021
Small Business Forum recommended that the Commission provide exemptions or scaled requirements for small
and medium-sized companies in connection with any new ESG disclosure requirements adopted by the
Commission. See Report on the 40th Annual Small Business Forum (May 2021), available at
https://www.sec.gov/files/2021_OASB_Annual_Forum_Report_FINAL_508.pdf. See also Office of the
Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation, Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2021 (supporting “efforts to
continue tailoring the disclosure and reporting framework to the complexity and size of operations of
companies, either by scaling obligations or delaying compliance for the smallest of the public companies,
particularly as it pertains to potential new or expanded disclosure requirements”).
698 See infra Section II.M.
278
Request for Comment
175. Should the proposed climate-related disclosures be required in Exchange Act reports
and registration statements, as proposed? Should we exempt SRCs from all of the proposed
climate-related disclosure rules instead of exempting them solely from Scope 3 emissions
disclosure requirements, as proposed? Should we exempt SRCs from certain other proposed
climate-related disclosure requirements and, if so, which requirements? For example, in addition
to the proposed exemption from Scope 3 emissions disclosure, should we exempt SRCs from the
proposed requirement to disclose Scopes 1 and 2 emissions? Are there certain types of other
registrants, such as EGCs or business development companies (“BDCs”),699 that should be
excluded from all or some of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules?
176. Should we require foreign private issuers that report on Form 20-F to provide the same
climate-related disclosures as Form 10-K filers, as proposed? Should we require climate-related
disclosures in the registration statements available for foreign private issuers, as proposed? If
not, how should the climate-related disclosures provided by foreign private issuer registrants
differ from the disclosures provided by domestic registrants?
177. Should we require a registrant to disclose any material changes to the climate-related
disclosure provided in its registration statement or annual report in its Form 10-Q or Form 6-K,
as proposed? Are there any changes that should be required to be reported on Form 8-K?
178. Should we require the climate-related disclosure in the forms specified above? Is the
application of the proposed rules to the forms sufficiently clear, or should we include additional
699 A BDC is a closed-end investment company that has a class of its equity securities registered under, or has filed
a registration statement pursuant to, Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and elects to be regulated as a business
development company. See Section 54 of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-53. Like other Section
12 registrants, BDCs are required to file Exchange Act annual reports.
279
clarifying amendments? For example, would the application of proposed Article 14 to Forms
20-F, F-1 and F-3 be sufficiently clear when a registrant prepares its financial statements
pursuant to IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) without
reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), or should we
add a related instruction to those forms?
179. Are there certain registration statements or annual reports that should be excluded from
the scope of the proposed climate-related disclosure rules? For example, should we exclude
Securities Act registration statements filed in connection with a registrant’s initial public
offering? Would such an accommodation help address concerns about the burdens of
transitioning to public company status? We have not proposed to require climate-related
disclosures in registration statements on Form S-8 or annual reports on Form 11-K. Should we
require such disclosures?
180. Should we require climate-related disclosure in Forms S-4 and F-4, as proposed?
Should we provide transitional relief for recently acquired companies? For example, should we
provide that a registrant would not be required to provide the proposed climate-related
disclosures for a company that is a target of a proposed acquisition under Form S-4 or F-4 until
the fiscal year following the year of the acquisition if the target company is not an Exchange Act
reporting company and is not the subject of foreign climate-related disclosure requirements that
are substantially similar to the Commission’s proposed requirements? Should such transitional
relief in this instance be for a longer period than one year and, if so, for how long should such
transitional relief extend?
181. We have not proposed to amend Form 40-F, the Exchange Act form used by a
Canadian issuer eligible to report under the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (“MJDS”) to
280
register securities or to file its annual report under the Exchange Act, to include the proposed
climate-related disclosure requirements. Should we require a Form 40-F issuer to comply with
the Commission’s proposed climate-related disclosure requirements? Should we permit a MJDS
issuer to comply with Canadian climate-related disclosure requirements instead of the proposed
rules if they meet certain conditions or provide certain additional disclosures and, if so, which
conditions or disclosures?
182. The proposed rules would not apply to asset-backed issuers. The Commission and staff
are continuing to evaluate climate-related disclosures with respect to asset-backed securities.
Should we require asset-backed issuers to provide some or all of the disclosures under proposed
Subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K? If so, which of the proposed disclosures should apply to assetbacked issuers? Are other types of climate disclosure better suited to asset-backed issuers? How
can climate disclosure best be tailored to various asset classes?
183. Should we adopt an alternative reporting provision that would permit a registrant that is
a foreign private issuer and subject to the climate-related disclosure requirements of an
alternative reporting regime that has been deemed by the Commission to be substantially similar
to the requirements of proposed Subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation SX to satisfy its disclosure obligations under those provisions by complying with the reporting
requirements of the alternative reporting regime (“alternative reporting provision”)? If so,
should we require the submission of an application for recognition of an alternative reporting
regime as having substantially similar requirements for purposes of alternative reporting
regarding climate-related disclosures? Should we permit companies, governments, industry
groups, or climate-related associations to file such an application? Should we require the
applicant to follow certain procedures, such as those set forth in 17 CFR 240.0-13?
281
184. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we specify certain minimum
standards that the alternative reporting regime must meet in order to be recognized and, if so,
what standards? For example, should we specify that an alternative reporting regime must
require the disclosure of a foreign private issuer’s Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and related targets,
the proposed financial statement metrics, as well as disclosures pursuant to the TCFD’s
recommendations regarding governance, strategy, and risk management disclosure? Should we
specify that the alternative reporting regime must require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions
and, if so, should we deem the alternative reporting regime to be substantially similar even if its
Scope 3 emissions requirements become effective after the Commission’s phase in period for
Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements? Should we specify that the alternative reporting
regime must require the disclosure of scenario analysis if a registrant uses scenario analysis in
formulating its strategy regarding climate-related risks? Are there certain climate-related
disclosure requirements that have been adopted or are in the process of being adopted in other
jurisdictions that we should consider to be substantially similar to the Commission’s rules for
purposes of an alternative reporting provision? If so, which requirements should we consider?
185. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should it be a mutual recognition system,
so that, as a condition of our recognition of a particular jurisdiction as an alternative reporting
regime, that jurisdiction must recognize the Commission’s climate-related disclosure rules as an
alternative reporting system that a registrant dual-listed in the United States and the other
jurisdiction may use to fulfill the foreign jurisdiction’s climate-related disclosure rules?
186. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we require a registrant filing the
alternative climate-related disclosure to make certain changes that we deem necessary as a
condition to alternative reporting? For example, should we require a registrant to comply with
282
XBRL tagging requirements as a condition to filing alternative climate-related disclosure? Are
there other specific conditions that we should impose on disclosure under an alternative climate
reporting provision?
187. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we require a registrant using that
system to:
• State in the filing that it is relying on this alternative reporting provision;
• Identify the alternative reporting regime for which the climate-related disclosure was
prepared;
• Identify the exhibit number of the filing where the alternative disclosure can be found;
and
• File a fair and accurate English translation of the alternative climate-related disclosure if
in a foreign language?
Would these requirements enhance the accessibility of the alternative disclosures? Are there
other requirements that we should impose to enhance the transparency of the alternative climaterelated disclosure?
188. If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should we permit a registrant to follow
the submission deadline of the approved alternative reporting regime even if that deadline differs
from the deadline for reporting under our rules? If so, what conditions, if any, should apply to
permit the use of such alternative deadline? For example, should the registrant be required to
provide adequate notice, before the due date of the Commission filing in which the alternative
disclosure is required to be included? Should such notice indicate the registrant’s intent to file
the alternative disclosure using the alternative jurisdiction’s deadline? If so, what would
constitute adequate notice? For example, should the deadline for filing the notice be three, five,
283
or ten business days before the Commission filing deadline? Should we permit a registrant to
provide such notice through an appropriate submission to the Commission’s EDGAR system?
Should we permit a registrant to indicate in its Form 20-F or other report that it will file the
alternative disclosure at a later date if permitted to do so by the alternative reporting regime? In
that case, should we permit the registrant to file the alternative disclosure on a Form 6-K or 8-K?
Should we instead require a registrant to submit the notice via a form that we would create for
such purpose? Should there be any consequences if a registrant fails to file a timely notice or
fails to file the alternative disclosure by the alternative regime’s due date? For example, should
we preclude such a registrant from relying on the alternative reporting provision for the
following fiscal year?
189. An International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has recently been created,
which is expected to issue global sustainability standards, including climate-related disclosure
standards.700
 If we adopt an alternative reporting provision, should that provision be structured
to encompass reports made pursuant to criteria developed by a global sustainability standards
body, such as the ISSB? If so, should such alternative reporting be limited to foreign private
issuers, or should we extend this option to all registrants? What conditions, if any, should we
place on a registrant’s use of alternative reporting provisions based on the ISSB or a similar
body?
K. Structured Data Requirement
The proposed rules would require a registrant to tag the proposed climate-related
disclosures in a structured, machine-readable data language.701
 Specifically, the proposed rules
700 See supra note 92.
701 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1507.
284
would require a registrant to tag climate-related disclosures in Inline eXtensible Business
Reporting Language (“Inline XBRL”) in accordance with 17 CFR 232.405 (Rule 405 of
Regulation S-T) and the EDGAR Filer Manual. The proposed requirements would include block
text tagging and detail tagging of narrative and quantitative disclosures provided pursuant to
Subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X.702
In 2009, the Commission adopted rules requiring operating companies to submit the
information from the financial statements (including footnotes and schedules thereto) included in
certain registration statements and periodic and current reports in a structured, machine-readable
data language using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”).703
 In 2018, the
Commission adopted modifications to these requirements by requiring issuers to use Inline
XBRL, which is both machine-readable and human-readable, to reduce the time and effort
associated with preparing XBRL filings and improve the quality and usability of XBRL data for
702 For the proposed Subpart 1500 disclosures, this tagging requirement would be implemented by including a
cross-reference to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T in proposed Item 1507 of Regulation S-K, and by revising Rule
405(b) of Regulation S-T to include the proposed climate-related disclosures required by Subpart 1500 of
Regulation S-K. The proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X disclosures would be subject to existing
requirements in Rule 405(b) to tag information in financial statements (including footnotes). Pursuant to Rule
301 of Regulation S-T the EDGAR Filer Manual is incorporated by reference into the Commission’s rules. In
conjunction with the EDGAR Filer Manual, Regulation S-T governs the electronic submission of documents
filed with the Commission. Rule 405 of Regulation S-T specifically governs the scope and manner of
disclosure tagging requirements for operating companies and investment companies, including the requirement
in Rule 405(a)(3) to use Inline XBRL as the specific structured data language to use for tagging the disclosures.

investors.704
 In 2020, the Commission adopted Inline XBRL requirements for business
development companies that will be effective no later than February 2023.705
Requiring Inline XBRL tagging of the proposed climate-related disclosures would benefit
investors by making the disclosures more readily available and easily accessible to investors,
market participants, and other users for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis, as
compared to requiring a non-machine readable data language such as ASCII or HTML. This
would enable automated extraction and analysis of climate-related disclosures, allowing
investors and other market participants to more efficiently perform large-scale analysis and
comparison of climate-related disclosures across companies and time periods. At the same time,
we do not expect the incremental compliance burden associated with tagging the additional
information to be unduly burdensome, because issuers subject to the proposed requirements are
or in the near future will be subject to similar Inline XBRL requirements in other Commission
filings.706
Request for Comment
190. Should we require registrants to tag the climate-related disclosures, including block text
tagging and detail tagging of narrative and quantitative disclosures required by Subpart 1500 of
Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X in Inline XBRL, as proposed? Should we
permit custom tags for the climate-related disclosures?

2018)]. Inline XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL data directly into an HTML document, eliminating the need
to tag a copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit. Id. at 40851.

706 See supra notes 704 and 705. Inline XBRL requirements for business development companies will take effect
beginning Aug. 1, 2022 (for seasoned issuers) and Feb. 1, 2023 (for all other issuers). See id. If the proposed
Inline XBRL requirements are adopted in the interim, they will not apply to business development companies
prior to the aforementioned effectiveness dates.
286
191. Should we modify the scope of the proposed climate-related disclosures required to be
tagged? For example, should we only require tagging of the quantitative climate-related metrics?
192. Are there any third-party taxonomies the Commission should look to in connection with
the proposed tagging requirements?
193. Should we require issuers to use a different structured data language to tag climaterelated disclosures? If so, what structured data language should we require? Should we leave
the structured data language undefined?
L. Treatment for Purposes of Securities Act and Exchange Act
We are proposing to treat the proposed required climate-related disclosures as “filed” and
therefore subject to potential liability under Exchange Act Section 18,
707 except for disclosures
furnished on Form 6-K. The proposed filed climate-related disclosures would also be subject to
potential Section 11 liability708 if included in or incorporated by reference into a Securities Act
registration statement. This treatment would apply both to the disclosures in response to
proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and to proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X.
Form 6-K disclosures would not be treated as “filed” because the form, by its own terms,
states that “information and documents furnished in this report shall not be deemed to be “filed”
for the purposes of Section 18 of the Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.”709

The treatment of disclosures on Form 6-K as furnished is a long-standing part of our foreign
private issuer disclosure system.710
707 15 U.S.C. 78r.
708 15 U.S.C. 77k.

710 See Release No. 34-8069 (Apr. 28, 1967), [32 FR 7853 (May 30, 1967)]. Form 6-K’s treatment as furnished for
purposes of Section 18 has existed since the Commission adopted the form.
287
Commenters expressed differing views on whether we should treat Commissionmandated climate-related disclosures as filed or furnished. Many commenters recommended that
we treat such climate-related disclosures as filed.711
 Some of these commenters stated that we
should treat climate-related disclosures like financial disclosures and require them to be filed
together with the rest of the Commission filing.
712 Other commenters indicated that the
treatment of climate-related disclosures as filed would help ensure that investors have confidence
in the accuracy and completeness of such disclosures because of the liability associated with
filed documents.
713
Other commenters recommended that we treat climate-related disclosures as furnished.714

Some of these commenters stated that the Commission’s treatment of such disclosures as filed
could act as a disincentive to providing “broader” disclosure and would incentivize some issuers
“to disclose in the manner most limited to meet the specific requirement and avoid more robust
explanation.”
715
 Other commenters stated that the treatment of climate-related disclosures as

furnished would be appropriate because, in their view, much of that disclosure is based on
projections and aspirational statements ill-suited to the application of a stricter liability
standard.716
We agree with those commenters who indicated that the treatment of climate-related
disclosures as filed could help promote the accuracy and reliability of such disclosures for the
benefit of investors.717
 In this regard, we believe these disclosures should be subject to the same
liability as other important business or financial information that the registrant includes in its
registration statements and periodic reports. While we acknowledge commenters who stated that
the methodology underlying climate data continues to evolve,718 we intend to provide registrants
with an ample transition period to prepare to provide such disclosure.719
 Further, much of the
disclosure proposed to be required reflects discussion of a company’s own climate risk
assessment and strategy, which is not dependent on external sources of information. In addition,
we have provided guidance and proposed rules on the applicability of safe harbors to certain
disclosures under the proposed rules. For these reasons, we believe it would be appropriate for
the proposed disclosures to be filed rather than furnished, except with respect to the proposed
disclosure we are requiring on Form 6-K.
Request for Comment
194. Should we treat the climate-related disclosures required by proposed subpart 1500 of
Regulation S-K and proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X as filed for purposes of potential
716 See, e.g., letters from National Mining Association; and United Airlines Holdings.

719 See infra Section II.M.
289
liability under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, except for the climate disclosures on Form
6-K, as proposed? Should we instead treat the climate-related disclosures required by both
proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X as
furnished? Are there reasons why the proposed climate-related disclosures should not be subject
to Section 18 liability?
195. Should we only treat the climate-related disclosures required by proposed subpart 1500
of Regulation S-K as filed? Should we only treat the climate-related disclosures required by
proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X as filed? Is there some other subset of climate-related
disclosures that should be treated as furnished rather than filed? For example, should we only
treat as filed disclosures related to a registrant’s Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and treat a registrant’s
Scope 3 emissions as furnished?
196. Should we treat the climate disclosures on Form 6-K as filed?
M. Compliance Date
We recognize that many registrants may require time to establish the necessary systems,
controls, and procedures to comply with the proposed climate-related disclosure requirements.
In addition, some commenters recommended that the Commission not adopt a “one size fits all”
approach when promulgating climate-related disclosure rules because such an approach would
disproportionately impact smaller registrants.720
 In order to provide registrants, especially
smaller registrants, with additional time to prepare for the proposed climate-related disclosures,
we are proposing phased-in dates for complying with proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K
and Article 14 of Regulation S-X, which would provide additional time for certain smaller
720 See supra note 556.
290
registrants. The table below summarizes the proposed phase-ins for the compliance date. The
table assumes, for illustrative purposes, that the proposed rules will be adopted with an effective
date in December 2022, and that the registrant has a December 31st fiscal year-end.

Exempted
The proposed compliance dates in the table above would apply to both annual reports and
registration statements. For example, if a non-accelerated filer with a December 31st fiscal yearend filed a registration statement that was not required to include audited financial statements for
fiscal year 2024 (e.g., the registration statement was filed in 2023 or 2024), it would not be
required to comply with the proposed climate disclosure rules in that registration statement.
A registrant with a different fiscal year-end date that results in its fiscal year 2023
commencing before the effective date of the rules would not be required to comply with subpart
1500 of Regulation S-K and Article 14 of Regulation S-X until the following fiscal year. For
example, a large accelerated filer with a March 31st fiscal year-end date would not be required to
comply with the proposed climate disclosure rules until its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024, filed
in June, 2024. This would provide large accelerated filers, who would have the earliest
compliance date of all categories of filers, with what we believe is a reasonable amount of time
to comply with the rules.
291
We believe that initially applying the disclosure requirements to the more limited pool of
large accelerated filers would be appropriate, because many large accelerated filers are already
collecting and disclosing climate-related information, have already devoted resources to these
efforts, and have some levels of controls and processes in place for such disclosure.721 In
comparison, registrants that are not large accelerated filers may need more time to develop the
systems, controls, and processes necessary to comply with the proposed rules, and may face
proportionately higher costs. Accordingly, we propose to provide them additional time to
comply.
We also recognize that obtaining the data necessary to calculate a registrant’s Scope 3
emissions might prove challenging since much of the data is likely to be under the control of
third parties. In order to provide sufficient time for registrants to make the necessary
arrangements to begin gathering and assessing such data, we are proposing an additional oneyear phase-in period for the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements. As previously
mentioned, we also are proposing an exemption for SRCs from the proposed Scope 3 emissions
disclosure provision.722

The proposed mandatory compliance periods are intended to provide registrants with
ample time to prepare to provide the proposed disclosures. Registrants would, however, be able
to provide the disclosures at any time after the effective date of the rules.
Request for Comment
197. Should we provide different compliance dates for large accelerated filers, accelerated
filers, non-accelerated filers, or SRCs, as proposed? Should any of the proposed compliance
721 See, e.g., letters from Adobe; Apple; BNP Paribas; bp; Chevron; Eni SpA; and Walmart.
722 See supra Section II.G.3.
292
dates in the table above be earlier or later? Should any of the compliance dates be earlier so that,
for example, a registrant would be required to comply with the Commission’s climate-related
disclosure rules for the fiscal year in which the rules become effective?
198. Should we provide a compliance date for the proposed Scope 3 emissions disclosure
requirements that is one year later than for the other disclosure requirements, as proposed?
Should the compliance dates for the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements be earlier or
later? Should the compliance date for the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements depend
upon whether the registrant is a large accelerated filer, accelerated filer, or non-accelerated filer?
199. Should we provide different compliance dates for registrants that do not have a
December 31st fiscal year-end?
200. Should we include rules or guidance addressing less common situations, such as, but not
limited to, reverse mergers, recapitalizations, other acquisition transactions, or if a registrant’s
SRC (or EGC) status changes as a result of such situations?
201. Are there other phase-ins or exemptions regarding any or all of the proposed rules that
we should provide?
III. GENERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENTS
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments on any aspect of the
proposed amendments, other matters that might have an impact on the proposed amendments,
and any suggestions for additional changes. With respect to any comments, we note that they are
of greatest assistance to our rulemaking initiative if accompanied by supporting data and analysis
of the issues addressed in those comments and by alternatives to our proposals where
appropriate.
293
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
We are mindful of the economic effects that may result from the proposed rules,
including the benefits, costs, and the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 723
This section analyzes the expected economic effects of the proposed rules relative to the current
baseline, which consists of the regulatory framework of disclosure requirements in existence
today, the current disclosure practices of registrants, and the use of such disclosures by investors
and other market participants.
We anticipate the proposed rules will give rise to several benefits by strengthening
investor protection, improving market efficiency, and facilitating capital formation. The primary
benefit is that investors would have access to more consistent, comparable, and reliable
disclosures with respect to registrants’ climate-related risks, which is expected to enable
investors to make more informed investment or voting decisions. 724 By providing access to this
information through SEC filings for all public issuers, this enhanced disclosure could mitigate
the challenges that investors currently confront in assessing the nature and extent of the climaterelated risks faced by registrants and their impact on registrants’ business operations and
financial condition. In this way, the proposed rules may reduce information asymmetry both
among investors, which can reduce adverse selection problems and improve stock liquidity,
725
723 Section 2(b) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77b (b), and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act, 17 U.S.C. 78c(f),
require the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an
action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors,
whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act, 17 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2), requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to
consider the impact that the rules would have on competition, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any
rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange
Act.
724 See infra Section IV.C.1.
725 Id.
294
and between investors and firms, which can reduce investors’ uncertainty about estimated future
cash flows, thus lowering the risk premium they demand and therefore registrant’s cost of
capital. The proposed rules could also mitigate certain agency problems between the firm’s
shareholders and management, thus strengthening investor protection.726 Further, by enabling
climate-related information to be more fully incorporated into asset prices, the proposed rules
would allow climate-related risks to be borne by those who are most willing and able to bear
them, thereby strengthening financial system resilience. Taken together, the proposed rules are
expected to contribute to the efficient allocation of capital, capital formation, competition, and
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.727
We are also mindful of the costs that would be imposed by the proposed rules.
Registrants would face increased compliance burdens in meeting the new disclosure
requirements. In some cases, these additional compliance burdens could be significant while in
others relatively small if companies already provide information similar to that required by our
rules. Other potential costs include increased litigation risk and the potential disclosure of
proprietary information about firms’ operations and/or production processes.728
A. Baseline and Affected Parties
This section describes the current regulatory and economic landscape with respect to
climate-related disclosures. It discusses the parties likely to be affected by the proposed rules,
current trends in registrants’ voluntary reporting on climate risks, related assurance practices, and
726 Id.
727 See infra Section IV.D.
728 See infra Section IV.C.2
295
existing mandatory disclosure rules under state and other Federal laws. These factors form the
baseline against which we estimate the likely economic effects of the proposed rules.
1. Affected Parties
The proposed disclosure requirements would apply to Forms S-1, F-1, S-3, F-3, S-4, F-4,
S-11, 6-K, 10, 10-Q, 10-K, and 20-F. Thus, the parties that are likely affected by the proposed
rules include registrants subject to the disclosure requirements imposed by these forms, as well
as investors and other market participants that use the information in these filings (e.g. financial
analysts, investment advisors, asset managers, etc.).
The proposed rules may affect both domestic registrants and foreign private issuers
(FPIs).729 We estimate that during calendar year 2020, excluding registered investment
companies, there were approximately 6,220 registrants that filed on domestic forms730 and
approximately 740 FPIs that filed on Forms 20-F. Among the registrants that filed on domestic
forms, approximately 31 percent were large accelerated filers, 11 percent were accelerated filers,
and 58 percent were non-accelerated filers. In addition, we estimate that approximately 50
percent of these domestic registrants were smaller reporting companies (SRCs) and 22 percent
were emerging growth companies (EGCs).
729 FPIs refer to the subset of all FPIs that file annual reports on Form 20-F, excluding MJDS filers using form 40-
F.The number of domestic registrants and FPIs affected by the final amendments is estimated as the number of
unique companies, identified by Central Index Key (CIK), that filed a Form 10-K, Form 20-F, or an amendment
thereto, or both a Form 10-Q and a Form S-1, S-3, S-4, or S-11 with the Commission during calendar year
2020, excluding asset-backed securities issuers. For purposes of this economic analysis, these estimates do not
include registrants that only filed a Securities Act registration statement during calendar year 2020, or only filed
a Form 10-Q not preceded by a Securities Act registration statement (in order to avoid including entities such as
certain co-issuers of debt securities). We believe that most registrants that have filed a Securities Act
registration statement or a Form 10-Q not preceded by a Securities Act registration statement, other than such
co-issuers, would be captured by this estimate. The estimates for the percentages of SRCs, EGCs, accelerated
filers, large accelerated filers, and non-accelerated filers are based on data obtained by Commission staff using a
computer program that analyzes SEC filings, with supplemental data from Ives Group Audit Analytics and
manual review of filings by staff.
730 This number includes approximately 20 FPIs that filed on domestic forms in 2020 and approximately 90 BDCs.
296
2. Current Regulatory Framework
A number of the Commission’s existing disclosure requirements may elicit disclosure
about climate-related risks; however, many of these requirements are principles-based in nature
and thus the nature and extent of the information provided depends to an extent on the judgment
of management. As discussed above, in 2010, the Commission published interpretive guidance
on existing disclosure requirements as they pertain to business or legal developments related to
climate change.731 The 2010 Guidance emphasized that if climate-related factors have a material
impact on a firm’s financial condition, disclosure may be required under current Item 101
(Description of Business), Item 103 (Legal Proceedings), Item 105 (Risk Factors), or Item 303
(MD&A) of Regulation S-K. While these provisions may elicit some useful climate-related
disclosure, these provisions have not resulted in the consistent and comparable information about
climate-related risks that many investors have stated that they need in order to make informed
investment or voting decisions.732
3. Existing State and Federal Laws
There are also state and other Federal laws that require certain climate-related disclosures
or reporting. For instance, there are requirements for mandatory climate risk disclosure within
the insurance industry. As of 2021, 14 states733 and the District of Columbia require any
731 See Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change, Release No. 33-9106 (Feb. 2,
2010) [75 FR 6290 (Feb, 8, 2010)] (“2010 Climate Change Guidance”), available at
https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf (The guidance did not create new legal requirements nor
modify existing ones. Instead, it highlighted climate-related topics that registrants should consider in seeking to
meet their existing disclosure obligations (e.g. the impact of legislation, regulation, international accords,
indirect consequences, physical risks, etc.) and in what section they should be discussed (e.g. risk factors,
MD&A, etc.)). See also discussion in Section I.A.
732 See Section I.B.
733 The 14 states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.
297
domestic insurers that write more than $100 million in annual net written premium734 to disclose
their climate-related risk assessment and strategy via the NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure
Survey.735 Survey question topics include climate risk governance, climate risk management,
modeling and analytics, stakeholder engagement, and greenhouse gas management. In fiscal year
2020, there were 66 publicly traded insurance companies that may be required to provide
disclosure pursuant to these state law provisions and that also would be subject to the proposed
rules.
There also exist Federal- and state-level reporting requirements related to greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. Federal GHG reporting requirements consist of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2009 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule.736 This rule
requires large direct emitters and suppliers of fossil fuels to report their emissions to the EPA.
737
Specifically, the rule requires each facility that directly emits more than 25,000 metric tons of
CO2e per year to report these direct emissions. Additionally, facilities that supply certain
products that would result in over 25,000 metric tons of CO2e if those products were released,
734 Net written premium is defined as the premiums written by an insurance company, minus premiums paid to
reinsurance companies, plus any reinsurance assumed.
735 See NAIC, Assessments of and Insights from NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Data (Nov. 2020), available at
https://content.naic.org/article/news_release_naic_assesses_provides_insight_insurer_climate_risk_disclosure_s
urvey_data.htm.
736 See 40 CFR Part 98 (2022); see also EPA, EPA Fact Sheet: Greenhouse Gases Reporting Program
Implementation (2013), available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-09/documents/ghgrpoverview-factsheet.pdf.
737 According to the EPA, "direct emitters" are facilities that combust fuels or otherwise put GHGs into the
atmosphere directly from their facility. An example of this is a power plant that burns coal or natural gas and
emits carbon dioxide directly into the atmosphere. The EPA estimates that the GHGRP data reported by direct
emitters covers about half of total U.S. emissions. "Suppliers" are those entities that supply products into the
economy which if combusted, released or oxidized emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These fuels and
industrial gases are not emitted from the supplier facility but instead distributed throughout the country and
used. An example of this is gasoline, which is sold in the U.S. and primarily burned in cars throughout the
country. The majority of GHG emissions associated with the transportation, residential and commercial sectors
are accounted for by these suppliers.
298
combusted, or oxidized must similarly report these “supplied” emissions.
738 The resulting
emissions data are then made public through their website.
Due to the nature of the EPA’s reporting requirements, their emissions data does not
allow a clean disaggregation across the different scopes of emissions for a given registrant. The
EPA requires reporting of facility-level direct emissions, which can contribute to a registrant’s
Scope 1 emissions (but can typically be considered a subset, to the extent that the registrant has
other non-reporting facilities), and facility-level supplied emissions, which can contribute to a
registrant’s Scope 3 emissions (but can also be very different from it).739 Gases required to be
reported by the EPA include all those referenced by the GHG Protocol and included within the
proposed definition of “greenhouse gases.”740 The EPA estimates that the required reporting
under their rule covers 85-90% of all GHG emissions from over 8,000 facilities in the United
States.741

In addition, at least 17 states have specific GHG emissions reporting requirements.742
States’ rules vary with respect to reporting thresholds and emissions calculation methodologies,
738 The EPA’s emissions data does not include emissions from agriculture, land use, or direct emissions from
sources that have annual emissions of less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e.
739
 On this latest point, in particular, facility-level supplied emissions cannot necessarily be characterized as a
portion of the registrant’s Scope 3 emission as the boundaries of the entity required to report under the EPA
reporting regime (the facility) are different from the boundaries of the entity required to report under our
proposed rules (the registrant).
740 The EPA requires emissions reporting only for domestic facilities, while the proposed rule would not be limited
to U.S. facilities and includes indirect emissions. The EPA also requires some gases (e.g. fluorinated ethers,
perfluoropolyether) that are considered optional under the GHG Protocol and that are not included within the
proposed definition of “greenhouse gases.”
741 See supra note736.
742 See NCSL, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Targets and Market-Based Policies (2021), available at
https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-targets-and-market-basedpolicies.aspx. The 17 states with GHG reporting requirements are Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California,
Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine.
299
but most tend to focus on direct emissions (i.e., Scope 1), with certain exceptions. For example,
New York requires the reporting of direct emissions from any owner or operator of a facility that
directly emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons per year or more of GHGs, and 100,000 tons
per year or more of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).743 Colorado excludes oil and gas that is
exported out of state, but includes both imported and exported electricity when calculating the
state’s emissions inventory.744 California requires annual reporting of GHG emissions by
industrial sources that emit more than 10,000 metric tons of CO2e, transportation and natural gas
fuel suppliers, and electricity importers.745 As a result of these federal and state-level emissions
reporting requirements, some registrants affected by the proposed rules may already have in
place certain processes and systems to measure and disclose their emissions.
4. International Disclosure Requirements
Issuers with operations abroad may also be subject to those jurisdictions’ disclosure
requirements. Many jurisdictions’ current and/or proposed requirements are based on the
TCFD’s framework for climate-related financial reporting.746 In 2015, the Financial Stability
Board (FSB) established the TCFD, an industry-led task force charged with developing a
framework for assessing and disclosing climate-related financial risk. In 2017, the TCFD
published disclosure recommendations that provide a framework to evaluate climate-related risks

and opportunities through an assessment of their projected short-, medium-, and long-term
financial impact on an issuer. The framework establishes eleven disclosure topics related to four
pillars that reflect how companies operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics
and targets.747 The TCFD forms the framework for the recently published climate prototype
standard that the IFRS Foundation is considering as a potential model for standards by the IFRS
Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). As of September 2021, the
TCFD reported that eight jurisdictions have implemented formal TCFD-aligned disclosure
requirements for domestic issuers: Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, New
Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.748 In these jurisdictions, disclosures
are already being provided by in-scope issuers or are expected to start between 2022 and 2025.
Plans to expand the scope of current requirements have also been announced in several countries,
747 See TCFD, Overview (Mar. 2021) (“TCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020”), available at
https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/TCFD_Booklet_FNL_Digital_March-2020.pdf.
748 See TCFD, 2021 Status Report (Oct. 2021), available at
https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Status_Report.pdf.
301
including the United Kingdom,749 the European Union,750 and Japan.751 In addition, several other
jurisdictions have proposed TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements, issued policies or guidance
in line with the TCFD recommendations, or otherwise indicated support for the TCFD
749 For example, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a policy statement in 2021
expanding its TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements to standard issuers and formally incorporating references
to the TCFD’s Oct. 2021 guidance on metrics, targets and transition plans and updated implementation annex.
This policy will apply for accounting periods beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2022. The FCA requirements are
currently on a comply-or-explain basis; the FCA has announced that it plans to consult on making these
requirements mandatory alongside future proposals adapting the rules to any future ISSB climate standard, once
issued. See FCA, PS21/23: Enhancing Climate-Related Disclosures by Standard Listed Companies (Dec.
2021), available at https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-23.pdf. In addition, the United Kingdom has
adopted TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements for asset managers and certain asset owners, effective Jan. 1,
2022, with certain phase-ins. See FCA, PS21/24: Enhancing Climate-Related Disclosures by Asset Managers,
Life Insurers and FCA-Regulated Pension Providers (Dec. 2021), available at
https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-24.pdf.
750 In the European Union, the European Commission (EC) adopted a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability
Reporting Directive (CSRD), which would revise existing company reporting rules and aim to provide more
comparable and consistent information to investors. The CSRD proposal enlarges the scope of the reporting
requirements and would cover nearly 50,000 companies in the European Union. The CSRD proposal
acknowledges the importance of the IFRS’ efforts to establish the ISSB and seeks compatibility with the TCFD
recommendations, along with other international frameworks. The EC aims to have the new CSRD reporting
requirements in place for reporting year 2023. See Proposal for Directive of the European Parliament and of
the Council amending Directive 2013/34/EU, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation
(EU) No 537/2014, as regards corporate sustainability reporting, COM (2021) 189 final (Apr. 21, 2021),
available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0189. Additionally, the EC
is progressing work on reporting standards for meeting the proposed CSRD requirement. The European
Financial Reporting Advisory Group (“EFRAG”) published a climate standard prototype in Sept. 2021 that is
based on the TCFD framework. See EFRAG, Climate Standard Working Paper, (Sept. 8, 2021), available at
https://www.efrag.org/News/Project-527/EFRAG-PTF-ESRS-welcomes-Climate-standard-prototype-workingpaper?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1.
751 Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to make it mandatory for large companies to make
climate-related disclosures aligned with the TCFD framework from as early as Apr. 2022. In addition, climate
disclosures have been part of Japan’s corporate governance code since June 2021; however, the code is not
legally binding and the disclosures were introduced on a ‘comply-or-explain’ basis. In Apr. 2022, the Tokyo
Stock Exchange (TSE) will be replacing its First and Second sections, the “Mothers” market for startups and the
tech-focused JASDAQ, with three new segments: Prime, Standard and Growth. According to Nikkei,
companies listed on the Prime market will be required to comply with disclosure requirements aligned with the
TCFD recommendations starting in Apr. 2022. See Japan’s FSA to Mandate Climate Disclosures from Apr.
2022, (Oct. 2021), available at https://www.esginvestor.net/japans-fsa-to-mandate-climate-disclosures-fromapril-2022/.

recommendations, including Australia, Canada752, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia,
Norway, Russia and South Korea.753
 Insofar as issuers have operations abroad, they would
already be subject to these mandatory disclosure requirements, policies and guidance.
5. Current Market Practices
a. Climate-Related Disclosures in SEC Filings
The Commission’s staff reviewed 6,644 annual reports (Forms 10-K, 40-F, and 20-F)
submitted from June 27, 2019 until December 31, 2020 to determine how many contain any of
the following keywords: “climate change”, “climate risk”, or “global warming”. The presence of
any of the keywords in any part of the annual report is indicative of some form of climate-related
disclosure.754 Table 1 (presented as a graph in Figure 1) shows that 33% of all annual reports
contain some disclosure related to climate change, with a greater proportion coming from foreign
registrants (the corresponding percentages for Forms 20-F and 40-F are 39% and 73%,
respectively). Table 2 (presented as a graph in Figure 2) provides a breakdown by accelerated
filer status. Among large accelerated filers, 49% of filings discussed climate change, while the
figures for accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers are 29% and 17%, respectively. Table 3
(presented as a graph in Figure 3), which provides a breakdown by industry groups, shows that
752 The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is considering proposed climate-related disclosure requirements
largely consistent with the TCFD recommendations, with a few exceptions. The proposed requirements would
elicit disclosure by issuers related to the four pillars of the TCFD recommendations (Governance, Strategy, Risk
management, and Metrics and targets). The CSA anticipates that the proposed requirements would come into
force in 2022 and would be phased in over one and three year periods. See Consultation: Climate -Related
Disclosure Update and CSA and Request for Comment, available at https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2021-
10/csa_20211018_51-107_disclosure-update.pdf.
753 See TCFD 2021 Status Report, available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFDStatus_Report.pdf.
754 One limitation of using this keyword search is that it is unable to discern the extent or quality of climate-related
disclosures, nor can it determine specific sub-topics within climate-related disclosures. For these reasons, the
analysis was supplemented by natural language processing (NLP) analysis, as described later in this section.
303
the industries with the highest percentage of annual reports containing climate-related disclosure
include maritime transportation, electric services, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and rail
transportation, among others.

classify them into topics (i.e. clusters).755 The NLP analysis suggests that climate-related
disclosures can be broadly organized into four topics: business impact, emissions, international
climate accords, and physical risks. The analysis finds significant heterogeneity, both within the
quantity and content, of climate-related disclosures across industries, as shown in Figures 4 and
5. Figure 4 presents the intensity of disclosure for domestic filings. The intensity refers to
sentences per firm, which is calculated by taking the aggregate number of sentences in an
industry and dividing it by the total number of firms within the industry (including those that do
not discuss climate change at all). Thus, the intensity represents a more comparable estimate
across industries.
Figure 4 shows that firms in the following industries have the most ample climate-related
discussion, on average: electric services, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, passenger air and air
freight, and maritime transportation. The majority of the discussion is on business impact,
followed by emissions, international climate accords, and physical risks. Figure 5 presents the
corresponding information for foreign filings (Forms 40-F and 20-F). Overall, the analysis
indicates that the majority of the disclosure is focused on transition risks, with comparatively
fewer mentions of physical risk.
755 The specific NLP method used in this analysis is word embedding, which utilizes Google’s publicly available,
pre-trained word vectors that are then applied to the text of climate-related disclosures within regulatory filings.
While this NLP analysis can be used to identify the general topic and the extent of disclosures, it is limited in its
ability to discern the quality or decision-usefulness of disclosures from investors’ perspective.

Form 10-K filings from Russell 3000 firms over the last 12 years and found that the majority of
climate-related disclosure is focused on transition risks as opposed to physical risks.756 They
further report that while 35% of Russell 3000 firms provided climate-related information in
2009, this figure grew to 60% in 2020,757 representing a significant increase. They also found
that the extent of disclosure for a given report has increased. In 2009, firms mentioned climate
risks 8.4 times on average in their Form 10-K. This figure grew to 19.1 times in 2020.
b. Additional Trends in Climate-Related Disclosures
While Commission staff reviewed certain firms’ sustainability reports for climate-related
disclosures, they did not conduct a systematic review of a large, representative sample of
sustainability reports. However, as discussed below, a number of industry and advocacy groups
have examined the scope of voluntary ESG reporting, including climate-related disclosures and
their findings could be relevant to an assessment of the proposed rules’ impact.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (CCMC),
in collaboration with several other organizations, conducted a survey (“CCMC Survey”) on a
sample of U.S. public companies – 436 companies across 17 industries that range from small to
large in terms of market capitalization.758 According to the survey, over half of the companies
(52%) are currently publishing a corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability, ESG or
similar report whose content commonly includes information regarding climate-related risks.
756 See P. Bolstad, S. Frank, E. Gesick, and D. Victor, Flying Blind: What Do Investors Really Know About
Climate Change Risks in the U.S. Equity and Municipal Debt Markets, Hutchins Center Working Paper 67
(2020).
757 Id. The methodology uses a series of keywords to determine whether a company provides climate-related
disclosures. Some keywords may occur in non-climate contexts, with the authors noting that the statistics are
biased.
758 See Climate Change & ESG Reporting from the Public Company Perspective (2021), available at
https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CCMC_ESG_Report_v4.pdf.
311
The most frequently discussed topics there are energy (74%), emissions (70%), environmental
policy (69%), water (59%), climate mitigation strategy (57%), and supplier environmental
policies (35%). Among the registrants that report climate-related information to the public, the
majority disclose such information via external reports or company websites rather than
regulatory filings. Similar to the Commission staff review, the CCMC Survey finds that about a
third (34%) of the respondents disclose climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, or energy
sourcing in their SEC filings information on risks. Among these firms, 82% disclose such
information in Risk Factors, 26% in the MD&A, 19% in the Description of Business, and 4% in
Legal Proceedings.
The Governance & Accountability Institute759 (“G&A”) analyzed sustainability reports
by the companies belonging to the Russell 1000 Index and found that in 2020, 70% published
sustainability reports ̶ up from 65% in 2019 and 60% in 2018.760
Other sources confirm that, at least within samples of larger firms, a sizeable portion
already measure and disclose their emissions, though not necessarily through their regulatory
filings. The CDP761 reports that out of the 524 U.S. companies in their Climate High Impact
759 Governance & Accountability Institute Inc. (“G&A, Inc.”) is a consulting and research organization providing
services to publicly traded and privately owned companies to help enhance their public environmental, social
and governance (ESG) and sustainability profiles.
760 See G & A Inc., Sustainability Reporting in Focus (2021), available at https://www.gainstitute.com/research/ga-research-collection/sustainability-reporting-trends/2021-sustainability-reporting-infocus.html.
761 CDP operates a global disclosure system that enables companies, cities, states and regions to measure and
manage their environmental risks, opportunities and impacts. Despite not being a framework like GRI, SASB
and TCFD, CDP’s questionnaires gather both qualitative and quantitative information from across governance,
strategy, risk, impact and performance. To aid comparability and ensure comprehensiveness, CDP includes
sector-specific questions and data points. In 2018, CDP aligned its climate change questionnaire with the
TCFD.
312
Sample,762 402 disclosed through the CDP system in 2021, up from 379 in 2020, and 364 in
2019. Out of the sample of reviewed companies, 22.1% (89 out of 402 companies) reported
Scope 3 emissions in 2021. This reflects an increase from the previous two years, during which
18% (67 out of 379 companies) reported such information in 2020, and 17% (62 out of 364
companies) in 2019.763 One commenter stated that there is significant variation in disclosure
rates of GHG emissions across various industries.764 The commenter, using a sample of the 1,100
U.S. companies included within the Sustainalytics dataset, reports that the disclosure rate of
material Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions is 59.5%.765 Furthermore, the International Platform on
Sustainable Finance found that among the U.S. listed firms present in the Refinitiv dataset,
10.8% disclosed Scope 1 emissions in 2019, representing 55.4% of U.S. market capitalization.766
To the extent that registrants’ current climate-related disclosures overlap with the proposed rules,
registrants may face lower incremental compliance costs, as discussed in further detail below.767
c. Use of Third-Party Frameworks
Some companies follow existing third-party reporting frameworks when developing
climate-related disclosures for SEC filings or to be included in CSR, sustainability, ESG, or
similar reports. For instance, the CCMC Survey finds that 59% of respondents follow one or
762 The CDP Climate High Impact sample identifies companies deemed high impact based on two main
considerations – market cap and GHG emissions.

764 See Letter from Aron Szapiro, Head of Policy Research, Morningstar (June 9, 2021).
765 Id. The comment letter does not disaggregate the disclosure rate across the different scopes of emissions.
766 See State and Trends of ESG Disclosure Policy Measures Across IPSF Jurisdictions, Brazil, and the US,
International Platform on Sustainable Finance (2021) (The disclosure rates are calculated using data from

more such frameworks. Among these respondents, 44% use the SASB,768 31% use the GRI,769
29% use the TCFD,770 and 24% use the CDP.771 Similar statistics on the usage of different
reporting frameworks are also provided by other studies. The G&A report772 finds that 53% of
the Russel 1000 reporters either mention or align with SASB,773 52% utilized GRI reporting
standards,774 30% either mention or align with TCFD recommendations,775 and 40% responded
to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. The law firm White & Case also conducted an in768 The SASB standards are designed for communication by companies to investors about how sustainability issues
impact long-term enterprise value. SASB standards guide the disclosure of financially material sustainability
information by companies to their investors. SASB standards, which are available for 77 industries, identify the
subset of ESG issues most relevant to financial performance in each industry. The SASB standards can be both
complementary with the core elements of the TCFD recommendations, as well as used by organizations to
operationalize them. See https://www.sasb.org/about/sasb-and-other-esg-frameworks/
769 The GRI standards outline both how and what to report regarding the material economic, social and
environmental impacts of an organization on sustainable development. For 33 potentially material sustainability
topics, the GRI standards contain disclosure requirements. Three series of GRI standards support the reporting
process: the GRI Topic Standards, each dedicated to a particular topic and listing disclosures relevant to that
topic; the GRI Sector Standards, which are applicable to specific sectors; and the GRI Universal Standards,
which apply to all organizations. The GRI Standards can be used in sustainability reports, as well as in annual
or integrated reports that are oriented at a broad range of stakeholders. See
https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/
770 The TCFD recommended disclosures cover four core elements: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and
Metrics and Targets. Each element has two or three specific disclosures (as shown in Table 4) to be made in the
organization’s mainstream report (i.e. annual financial filings). These are meant to generate comparable,
consistent and reliable information on climate-related risks. The TCFD provides both general, and in some
cases, sector-specific guidance for each disclosure, while simultaneously framing the context for disclosure, and
offering suggestions on what and how to disclose in the mainstream report. See https://www.fsbtcfd.org/recommendations/
771 See supra note 761.
772
 See supra note 760.
773 Of the Russell 1000 reporting companies, 39% indicate that they are in alignment with SASB standards, while
the other 14% simply mention the standards.
774 Of those reporters utilizing the GRI standards, G&A finds that a small portion (5%) utilizes the
“Comprehensive” level of reporting, the majority (64%) chose to report in accordance with the “Core” option,
while the remaining portion (31%) utilizes “GRI-Referenced” reports, which are not fully in accordance with
the GRI standards. GRI-Referenced reports contain the GRI Content Index and reference certain disclosures.
775 Of the Russell 1000 reporting companies, 17% indicate that they are in alignment with the TCFD
recommendations, while the other 13% simply mention the recommendations.

depth review of website sustainability disclosures by 80 small- and mid-cap firms across five
different industries and found comparable numbers.776
While these various frameworks are distinct, they overlap in their alignment with the
TCFD. In particular, the CDP questionnaire fully incorporates the TCFD framework and thus
exhibits full alignment.777 The Corporate Reporting Dialogue778 also provides a detailed
assessment of the various frameworks’ degrees of alignment with each TCFD disclosure item,
ranging from maximum to minimum alignment as follows: Full, Reasonable, Moderate, Very
Limited, and None. They report that the GRI exhibits “Reasonable” alignment, while the SASB
generally exhibits “Moderate” or “Reasonable” alignment with the majority of the TCFD
disclosure items. Thus, companies that report following the CDP, SASB, or GRI frameworks
are, to varying degrees, already producing disclosures that are in line with parts of the TCFD.
However, because each framework takes different approaches (e.g. intended audience, reporting
channel) and because certain differences exist in the scope and definitions of certain elements,

d. Climate-Related Targets, Goals, and Transition Plan Disclosures
Carbon reduction targets or goals have become an increasing focus for both companies
and countries.780 For example, 191 countries, including the United States and European Union,
have signed the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement aims to strengthen the global response
to the threat of climate change by keeping a rise in global temperatures to well below 2º Celsius
above pre-industrial levels this century, as well as pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase
even further to 1.5º degrees Celsius.781 As of 2020, according to one source, about two-thirds of
S&P 500 companies have established a target for carbon emissions – a number that has nearly
doubled over the past decade.782 Approximately one-fifth of these companies have science-based
targets in-line with a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming.783 In addition, a growing
number of companies or organizations have signed on to the Climate Pledge, which indicates a
780 See Commitments to Net Zero Double in Less Than a Year, United Nations Climate Change (Sept. 21, 2020),
available at https://unfccc.int/news/commitments-to-net-zero-double-in-less-than-a-year.
781 See Section I.
782 See, e.g., J. Eaglesham, Climate Promises by Businesses Face New Scrutiny, The Wall Street Journal (2021),
available at www.wsj.com/articles/climate-promises-by-businesses-face-new-scrutiny-11636104600.
783 See memorandum, dated Nov. 30, 2021, concerning staff meeting with representatives of Persefoni. This
statistic is compiled by Persefoni using information from the Science Based Targets Initiative. This and the
other staff memoranda referenced below are available at https://www-draft.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-

317
commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040.784 The trend in companies disclosing other
climate-related targets (e.g. water usage) has also been increasing over time.785
Despite the increasing prevalence in stated targets and goals, monitoring which firms are
taking steps to implement them is difficult given the lack of required recurring standardized
metrics for progress. Absent such a monitoring device, investors have insufficient information to
gauge the credibility of the targets. Moreover, without knowing the specific strategy that
registrants intend on adopting in pursuit of their targets, investors are unable to determine how
the targets will impact the company’s financial position (e.g., a company that plans to only
purchase offsets may face different risks and costs over time than a company that invests in
renewable energy or carbon capture technology).786
Consistent with this need for an oversight or monitoring mechanism, research suggests
that the prevalence of “green bonds” and positive cumulative abnormal stock returns surrounding
their announcements may arise, at least in part, because they help signal credible valueenhancing targets in the absence of mandatory standardized public disclosures.787 These findings
suggest a demand for such an oversight or monitoring mechanism for targets and goals among
investors that would facilitate their understanding of registrants’ stated climate-related targets
and progress and the impact on the registrant’s business.
784 As of Jan. 25, 2022, The Climate Pledge has acquired 217 signatories. See The Climate Pledge, available at
https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en/Signatories.
785 For example, the percentage of both global and U.S. companies with water reduction targets grew by 4% in
2019 on a year-over-year basis. This represented 28% of major global companies (i.e. those listed on the S&P
Global 1200 index) and 27% of major (i.e. those listed in the S&P 500 index)) U.S. companies publicly
disclosing these targets. See State of Green Business 2021, available at
https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/state-of-green-business-2021.

Commitments? (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3898909.
787 See C. Flammer, Corporate Green Bonds, Journal of Financial Economics, 499-516 (2021). (Green bonds may
only be a partial solution to achieving credible targets given that they have implications beyond commitment.)
318
e. Third-Party Assurance of Climate-Related Disclosures
Among the companies that provide climate-related disclosures, a considerable portion
include some form of third-party assurance for these disclosures. The G&A study788 finds that
35% of Russell 1000 index firms, which are virtually all large accelerated filers, obtained thirdparty assurance for their sustainability reports in 2020, up from 24% in the year prior. The rate of
assurance is concentrated among the larger half of the sample firms (i.e., the S&P 500 firms).
Among the firms that obtained assurance, however, only 3% obtained assurance for the entire
report. The remaining firms were evenly split between obtaining assurance on specified sections
only and GHG emissions only. Regarding the level of assurance, the overwhelming majority
(90%) obtained limited assurance while only 7% obtained reasonable assurance. Regarding
service providers, 14% of firms received assurance from an accounting firm, 31% from small
consultancy/boutique firms, and 55% from engineering firms. Because these statistics are limited
to Russell 1000 firms, corresponding figures for the full sample of U.S. registrants may be lower
to the extent that the practice of obtaining third-party assurance is concentrated in large firms.789
788 See supra note 760.
789 Other studies also report evidence of third-party assurance among smaller samples of companies analyzed. For
example, according to a recent study by the International Federation of Accountants, in 2019, 99 out of the 100
largest U.S. firms by market capitalization provided some form of sustainability disclosure, which may contain
climate-related information among other sustainability-related topics. Seventy of those firms obtained some
level of third-party assurance, with the vast majority being “limited assurance” according to the study. Of the 70
firms that obtained assurance, the study reports that 54 obtained “limited assurance,” eight obtained “reasonable
assurance,” five obtained “moderate assurance,” and three did not disclose any assurance. Of the 81 unique
assurance reports examined in the study, nine were found to be issued by an auditing firm, while 72 were issued
by another service provider. See International Federation of Accountants (“IFAC”), The State of Play in
Sustainability Assurance (2021), available at https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/contributing-globaleconomy/publications/state-play-sustainability-assurance. Among the sample of 436 companies included in the
CCMC Survey, 28% disclosed that they engaged a third party to provide some form of assurance regarding their
climate-related disclosure (the frequency of these disclosures was 52% among the 436 companies in the
sample). See supra note 758.

B. Broad Economic Considerations
1. Investors’ Demand for Climate Information
Investors have expressed a need for information on climate-related risks as they relate to
companies’ operations and financial condition. 790 The results of multiple recent surveys indicate
that climate risks are among the most important priorities for a broad set of large asset
managers.791 PWC reported in their Annual Global CEO Survey that in 2016, only 39% of asset
and wealth management CEOs reported that they were concerned about the threats posed by
physical risks brought about climate change, whereas this figure increased to 70% in 2021.792
790 See 2021 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis (2021) (this statement has been
signed by 733 investors collectively managing over US$52 trillion in assets), available at
https://theinvestoragenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Global-Investor-Statement-to-Governmentson-the-Climate-Crisis.pdf; See also Alexander Karsner, Testimony Before the House Financial Services
Subcommittee on National Security, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND MONETARY POLICY (Sept. 11, 2019),
available at https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-116-ba10-wstate-karsnera-20190911.pdf. A
recent report examined how climate change could affect 22 different sectors of the U.S. economy and found that
if global temperatures rose 2.8 °C from pre-industrial levels by 2100, climate change could cost $396 billion
each year. If temperatures increased by 4.5˚ °C, the yearly costs would reach $520 billion. See Jeremy
Martinich and Allison Crimmins, Climate Damages and Adaptation Potential Across Diverse Sectors of the
United States, NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 9, 397–404 (2019); available at
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0444-6. Similarly, the Swiss Re Institute estimated how global
warming could affect 48 countries – representing 90% of the world economy – and found that the decrease in
GDP in North America could range from – 3.1% if Paris Agreement targets are met (a well-below 2°C
increase), to – 9.5% if no mitigating actions are taken (3.2°C increase); See The Economics of Climate Change:
No Action Not an Option, available at https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:e73ee7c3-7f83-4c17-a2b8-
8ef23a8d3312/swiss-re-institute-expertise-publication-economics-of-climate-change.pdf.
791 See, e.g., Emirhan Ilhan, Climate Risk Disclosure and Institutional Investors, Swiss Fin. Inst. Research Paper
Series (Working Paper No. 19-66), (last revised Jan. 7, 2020), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=3437178
(noting that a survey of 439 large institutional investors shows that 79% of respondents believe that climate risk
reporting is as important as traditional financial reporting, and almost one-third consider it to be more
important); See also Macquaire Asset Management 2021 ESG Survey Report (2021), available at
https://www.mirafunds.com/assets/mira/our-approach/sustainability/mam-esg-survey/mam-2021-esg-surveyreport.pdf (noting that in a survey of 180 global institutional real assets investors, including asset managers,
banks, consultants and investment advisors, foundations and endowments, insurance companies, and pension
funds, who combined represent more than $21 trillion of assets under management, more than half of
responding investors selected climate change as their primary ESG concern).

320
Investors’ demand for climate-related information may also be related to the transition
risks that companies face (e.g. changes in future regulation, shifts in investor, consumer,
counterparty preferences or other market conditions, and other technological challenges or
innovations). For example, the United States’ commitment to the Paris Agreement may have
contributed to investors’ demand for information on registrants’ emissions and exposure to
potential transition risk, as well as whether they have in place emissions targets with credible
pathways of achievement.793 The 2021 Institutional Investors Survey solicited the views of 42
global institutional investors managing over $29 trillion in assets (more than a quarter of global
assets under management (AUM)) and found that climate risk remains the number one investor
engagement priority. A significant majority (85%) of surveyed investors cite climate risk as the
leading issue driving their engagements with companies. These institutional investors also
indicated that they consider climate risk to be material to their investment portfolios and are
demanding robust and quantifiable disclosure around its impacts and the plan to transition to net
zero.794
State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) and Blackrock, two of the world’s largest
investment managers, recently announced the focus areas for their asset stewardship program for
2022, with climate change at the top of their priority list. One of the key expectations set by
SSGA this year is a requirement for companies to provide disclosures aligned with TCFD
recommendations, including reporting on board oversight on climate-related risks and

opportunities, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, and targets for emissions reduction.795 Similarly,
Blackrock expects to continue encouraging companies to demonstrate that their plans are
resilient under likely decarbonization pathways, and to ask that companies disclose a net zeroaligned business plan that is consistent with their business model to demonstrate how their
targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.796
Investors, including large institutional investors, have also formed initiatives aimed in
part at improving corporate disclosures on climate-related risks. These initiatives include the
Climate Disclosure Project, Climate Action 100+,797 the Global Investor Coalition on Climate
Change (“GIC”),798
 the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (“IIGCC”),799 and the
Transition Pathway Initiative (“TPI”),800 with many of these groups seeing increasing
membership in recent years.801 In addition to stated demand, revealed preferences from
investment decisions and asset price responses to ESG-related news and climate change risk

AUM. See Climate Action 100+, available at https://www.climateaction100.org/about/.
798 As of Apr. 2018, GIC was signed by 409 investors representing more than U.S. $24 trillion in AUM, available
at https://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Global_Investor_Coalition_on_Climate_Change_(GIC).
799 IIGCC has more than 330 members, mainly pension funds and asset managers, across 22 countries, with over
$33 trillion in AUM. See The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, available at
https://www.iigcc.org/.
800 The TPI is supported globally by 108 investors with more than $29 trillion combined AUM. See Transition
Pathway Initiative, available at https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/.
801 For example, Climate Action 100+ launched in 2017 with 225 investors with more than USD $26.3 trillion
AUM to engage with 100+ of the world’s highest emitting companies to reduce material climate risks. In 2021,
Climate Action 100+ has grown to 615 investors, $60 trillion in assets, engaging with 167 companies that
represent 80%+ of global industrial emissions.

suggest substantive demand for information on climate-related risks.802 Investors have also
demonstrated their interest in climate-related issues through an increase in climate-related
shareholder proposals803 and increased flows into mutual funds with environmental goals in their
investment mandates.804
2. Impediments to voluntary climate-related disclosures
a. General impediments to voluntary climate-related disclosures
In practice, however, investors’ demand for climate-related information is often met by
inconsistent and incomplete disclosures due to the considerable variation in the coverage,
specificity, location, and reliability of information related to climate risk. Multiple third-party
reporting frameworks and data providers have emerged over the years; however, these resources

803 A recent 2021 proxy season review by the Harvard Law School found that shareholder climate-related
proposals have increased for the second consecutive year. The authors also note that, in 2021, environmental
proposals were withdrawn at a meaningfully higher rate relative to the prior year. This is an indication of
stronger commitments from companies to take actions towards the specified environmental goals, or at the very
least provide the related disclosures. Many companies may prefer engaging with a proponent rather than taking
the proposal to a vote. See 2021 Proxy Season Review: Shareholder Proposals on Environmental Matters,

lack mechanisms to ensure compliance and can contribute to reporting fragmentation.805 Due to
deficiencies in current climate-reporting practices, investor demand for comparable and reliable
information does not appear to have been met.806 As a result, investors may face difficulties
locating and assessing climate-related information when making their investment or voting
decisions.807
 Below we describe some key market failures with regard to disclosure, for example
(1) disclosures are not costless; (2), there are agency problems;
808 (3) managers may inaccurately
present information; and (4) investor responses may be unpredictable and non-unfirm.
809
 In
addition, there may be other problems, e.g. a lack of consistency, that may indicate Commission
action.
(1) Disclosures are not costless
In practice, firms can still approach full disclosure voluntarily if there are costs to
disclosure, as long as these costs are relatively low.810 This is not the case, however, if individual
firms’ private benefits of disclosure are also small, yet those same disclosures provide positive
informational externalities. For example, disclosures by one registrant may provide investors
with useful information via inference with respect to peer firms. Consistent with this theory,
805 See Section IV.B.2.b.
806 See IOSCO, Report on Sustainability-Related Registrant Disclosures(2021), available at
https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD678.pdf.
807 See GAO, Climate-Related Risks (2018) available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-188.pdf (reporting that
“investors may find it difficult to navigate through the filings to identify, compare, and analyze the climaterelated disclosures across filings”).
808 Agency problems are those conflicts of interest between shareholders (i.e., the principals) and managers (i.e.,
the agents) of a firm.
809 See Beyer, Cohen, Lys, and Walther, The Financial Reporting Environment: Review of The recent Literature, J.
ACCT. ECON. 296–343 (2010) for a more technical and detailed discussion of these and other additional
assumptions.
810 See for example R.E. Verrecchia, Discretionary Disclosure, 5 JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 365-
380 (1983).
324
research in the accounting literature has documented that earnings announcements by one firm
can provide predictive signals about the earnings of other firms in the same industry.811 In these
cases, disclosures can benefit investors in the aggregate (though not necessarily investors of a
specific firm) by allowing them to make comparisons across firms, which can aid in their capital
allocation decisions.
This illustrates how, theoretically, in the absence of mandated disclosure requirements,
registrants fully internalize the costs of disclosure but not the benefits, which may lead them to
rationally under-disclose relative to what is optimal from the investors’ perspective.812
 As a
result, a tension can exist between investors (in the aggregate) and managers, where investors
prefer more disclosure and managers prefer less. In such instances, there may be scope for
regulation to substantially increase information provision since absent regulation, investors are
not able to fully ascertain the risks and opportunities that firms face.
(2) Agency problems
In order for voluntary disclosure to result in the complete revelation of all relevant private
information, there would need to be no agency problems (i.e., no conflicts of interest between
managers and shareholders) such that managers’ sole objective with respect to such disclosures
would be to maximize shareholder information and, ultimately, shareholder value. However, if
managers have other objectives and incentives for making voluntary disclosures (i.e., there exist
agency problems), then the voluntary disclosures may not result in the same complete
811 See Robert Freeman and Senyo Tse, An Earnings Prediction Approach to Examining Intercompany Information
Transfers, 15(4) J. ACCT. ECON. 509-523 (1992).
812 It is worth noting that in some cases, undertaking costly signals can allow agents to credibly signal their type to
investors. In these cases, costly disclosures can lead to a separating equilibrium where it may otherwise not
exist. See D. Kreps and J. Sobel, 2(1) Signaling, HANDBOOK OF GAME THEORY WITH ECONOMIC APPLICATIONS,
849-867 (1994); J. Riley, Silver Signals: Twenty-Five Years of Screening and Signaling, 39(1) JOURNAL OF
ECONOMIC LITERATURE 432-478, (2001).
325
information.813 Moreover, when agency problems exist, investors can no longer be sure if the
absence of disclosure under a voluntary regime reflects good or bad news for the firm, given that
some managers may have self-serving incentives. For example, managers may have career
concerns which could incentivize them to withhold disclosing information they expect to be
favorably received until it is useful to balance out bad news. In contrast, when the disclosure
requirements are mandatory, the relevant, complete information should be disclosed regardless
of managers’ objectives or incentives, and investors would accordingly have more confidence in
the completeness of the resulting disclosures. For these reasons, the benefits of a mandatory
reporting regime may be more pronounced in settings in which disclosure-related conflicts of
interests exist between managers and shareholders.
(3) Misrepresentation by managers
If investors are unable to verify that managerial disclosures are complete and truthful
(e.g., if investors have difficulty in determining the extent of managers’ selective disclosure of
metrics or methods of computation, exaggeration, obfuscation, outright misreporting, etc.), then
voluntary disclosures may not be fully revealing. For example, managers may be able to engage
in misleading reporting (i.e., they can apply a favorable bias to their disclosures), but they incur a
cost that increases with the magnitude of the misreporting.814 Under these circumstances,
theoretical research suggests that, in equilibrium, they may not accurately report their private
information. This is because investors would not be able to distinguish truthful disclosures from
813 See E. Einhorn. Voluntary Disclosure Under Uncertainty About the Reporting Objective, 43 JOURNAL OF
ACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 245-274(2007).
814 See E. Einhorn, and A. Ziv, Biased Voluntary Disclosure, REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 420-442 (2012)
(Biases in reporting can be any number of costs in these models. These include not only inefficient actual
investments associated with the cost of distorted reporting, but also the risk of litigation, reputation erosion,
and/or future flexibility in reporting.).
326
those that are misleading (i.e., favorably biased). In this setting, all managers would then have an
incentive to misreport by providing disclosures with a favorable bias, the extent of which
depends on the cost of misreporting. Furthermore, because misreporting comes at a cost, this
would violate the assumption of costless disclosure, which can exacerbate the issue of
incomplete disclosures.815
If, on the other hand, misreporting has no costs for managers, then this results in what is
referred to as a cheap talk equilibrium.816 In this setting, any misalignment of incentives between
managers and investors could again result in a situation in which not all relevant private
information is fully revealed. While this could be driven by agency problems stemming from
managerial self-interest, it also occurs when investors have heterogeneous preferences that cause
differing incentives or if managers are concerned with strategic disclosures that may be viewed
by not only investors, but also competitors, regulators, and customers.
In this case, a mandatory reporting regime would be beneficial to investors to the extent
that voluntary disclosures are unverifiable and possibly misleading. These include situations
where managers obfuscate certain information in their disclosures, convey information in a
complex or difficult manner, or conceal the discretionary choices with respect to what was
reported.
815 If misrepresentation becomes sufficiently costly, then there may be no managers who find it advantageous to
misrepresent, despite any potential benefits. In this case, purposeful misrepresentation would not occur, thereby
fulfilling one of the assumptions of the standard full revelation argument. Clear guidelines for disclosure and
imposed costs upon the discovery of misrepresentation are important mechanisms for enforcing and promoting
the transmission of information to investors.

(4) Uncertain investor responses
Another condition necessary for voluntary reporting to be fully revealing is that managers
must be certain of investor responses to disclosures. However, if investors have heterogeneous
prior beliefs, such that managers cannot determine whether investors will consider a given
disclosure good or bad news, then not all managers will choose to disclose, resulting in certain
private information remaining undisclosed.817 Similarly, if there are varying levels of
sophistication among investors in their ability to understand disclosures, then again, some
managers may be uncertain about how reports may be interpreted, leading them to abstain from
some disclosures.818 In this respect, mandatory disclosure is more likely to benefit investors in
settings where the types of disclosures are complex or divisive, such that managers may not be
certain how they will be perceived by investors with differing prior beliefs and/or sophistication.
b. Climate-specific factors that exacerbate impediments to voluntary disclosure
In the context of climate-related disclosure, these impediments may be made worse due
to agency problems arising from the potentially long-term nature of certain climate-related risks
and other issues related to the complexity and uncertainty of climate-related factors. We explore
each of these impediments in further detail.
Impediments to climate-related disclosures may be exacerbated due to agency problems
related to potential conflicts between short-term profitability and long-term climate risk horizons.
Physical and transition risks can materialize over time horizons ranging from the immediate

328
future to several decades.819 Likewise, shareholders may have interests in maximizing their
investment returns over both the short- and long-term. Agency problems can worsen to the extent
that the investment horizons of a firm’s shareholders and its management are misaligned.820 If
management prioritizes short-term results821 due to pressures to perform along certain metrics,822
management may fail to assess and provide relevant disclosures on certain climate-related
risks,823 particularly those that are medium- or long-term in nature.824 Stock-based management
compensation has the potential to mitigate this issue, provided that the stock price reflects the
value of the company in the long-run. However, under the current regime, certain climate-related
risks may be unobservable or obfuscated, and hence not fully reflected into stock prices, giving
819 Longer horizons, for example, tend to involve changes in chronic physical risks — sea-level rise, drought, etc.
Shorter-term horizons may, instead, be relevant for any increase in acute physical risks such as hurricanes,
wildfires, and heatwaves. See ING Climate Risk Report 2020, available at
https://www.ing.com/MediaEditPage/ING-Climate-Risk-report-2020.htm.
820 A stream of literature examines the association of climate-related disclosures with corporate governance
structures and managerial characteristics. See, e.g., M. Kılıç and C. Kuzey, The Effect of Corporate
Governance on Carbon Emission Disclosures: Evidence from Turkey, 11-1 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT 35-53 (2019). See also S. Yunus, E.T. Evangeline, and S.

822 Factors including corporate executive compensation and attention to quarterly earnings and reporting are
thought to contribute to excessive focus on short-term goals. See, e.g., Short-Termism Revisited, available at

beginning to emerge among some companies, but it is far from a common practice. Only 6% of respondents

short-term-focused managers an incentive to initiate or continue projects exposed to these risks
to maximize their compensation at the expense of long-term shareholder value.
Impediments to voluntary climate-related disclosures can also be exacerbated due to the
uncertainty and complexity of climate-related risks and the multidimensional nature of the
information being disclosed. First, this uncertainty and complexity may lead to misrepresentation
of disclosures, which, as discussed previously, violates a condition for the full revelation of
material information in a voluntary reporting environment. The complexity of these risks has led
to many types of methodologies, metrics, and statements that can be provided to communicate
potential economic impacts and risks.825 This multitude of choices to represent such risks may
therefore allow managers substantial discretion to selectively choose metrics that appear
favorable. If this managerial discretion is more difficult to be verified by investors, managers
may face lower costs for their misreporting. Moreover, the complex and multidimensional nature
of certain climate-related risks may further impede investors’ abilities to detect misreporting.
This could lead to a cheap-talk equilibrium, which, as previously discussed, could lead to
climate-related information remaining undisclosed.
The uncertainty and complexity of climate-related risks may also be an impediment to
voluntary disclosure if managers are less able to anticipate how investors may respond to such
disclosures. As noted above, predictable investor responses to disclosures is one of the key
assumptions necessary for the full revelation of material information in a voluntary reporting
825 See, e.g., TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, at 16 (June
2017), available at https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report11052018.pdf.

environment.826 Uncertainty in responses means mandatory disclosures have the potential to
improve information provision to investors. The challenge in anticipating investor responses to
climate-related disclosure may stem, in part, from the fact that the impact of these risks on
registrants’ financial outcomes and operations can vary significantly. This challenge may be
compounded by the uncertainty surrounding the future path of climate change and the evolving
nature of the science and methodologies measuring their economic impacts.827 The uncertainty
and complexity of climate-related risks are likely to cause substantial heterogeneity with respect
to investors’ interpretation of related disclosures and their understanding of firms’ exposures to
such risks, resulting in heterogeneous and unpredictable investor responses. In this circumstance,
managers may prefer to withhold applicable disclosures.828
Due to these impediments, companies may not report (or may report only limited
amounts of) relevant climate-related information, and hence, the stock price that investors
observe may not reflect the companies’ true exposures to physical and transition risks.829 Even
when companies assess and disclose climate-related risks, reporting fragmentation can present
826 In other words, this assumes that all investors uniformly interpret (and react to) managers’ disclosures or their
absence and that investors’ interpretation and reaction is known to managers. See, e.g., A. Beyer, D.A. Cohen,
T.Z. Lys, and B.R. Walther, The Financial Reporting Environment: Review of the Recent Literature, 50 (2)

substantial obstacles to investors in processing this information.830 This is because disclosures
currently vary considerably in terms of coverage, location, and presentation across companies,
making it difficult for investors to navigate through different information sources and filings to
identify, compare, and analyze climate-related information.831 Moreover, these disclosures are
often vague and boilerplate, creating further challenges for investors.832 While it may seem that
more information is always better, when the incentives of investors and managers diverge,
evidence suggests such amorphous statements could reduce the quality of communication both in
theory833 and in practice.834
The current regulatory regime leaves substantial uncertainty around the type of climaterelated information that should be disclosed and how it should be presented. Multiple third-party
climate reporting frameworks have emerged to try to fill this reporting gap.835 Due to the
voluntary nature of third-party frameworks, however, companies often disclose some but not all
components, and the components that are disclosed may not be the same across companies.836

in their regulatory filings.

ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY 1431-1451 (1982).

Financial Markets: Some Experimental Evidence, 12 (3) THE REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES 481–518 (July

835 The TCFD, the SASB, the GRI, the Principles for Responsible Investment, the PCAF, and the CDP (among
others), have all developed standards and systems that aim to help firms and investors identify, measure, and
communicate climate-related information and incorporate that information into their business practices.
Multiple frameworks have emerged, in part, because each seeks to provide different information or fulfill
different functions when it comes to disclosing information related to climate-related risks or other ESG factors
that may be important to investors.
836 See Climate Risk Disclosures & Practices, available at https://climatedisclosurelab.duke.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2020/10/Climate-Risk-Disclosures-and-Practices.pdf.
332
The location, format, and granularity of the information provided may also vary, although the
substance may be similar. This has resulted in considerable heterogeneity in firms’ existing
disclosure practices.837 The wide range of reporting practices and frameworks makes it difficult
to assess how much material climate-related information firms currently are disclosing and may
leave opportunities for companies to omit unfavorable information.838 Some studies point to the
potential for substantial underreporting of material climate-related information within the current
voluntary reporting regime.839
The proposed rules aim to address these market failures by requiring more specificity
around the way registrants disclose climate-related risks and their impacts on business activities
and operations in the short, medium, and long-term. By requiring comprehensive and
standardized climate-related disclosures along several dimensions, including disclosure on
governance, business strategy, risk management, financial statement metrics, GHG emissions,
and targets and goals, the proposed rules would provide investors with climate-related
837 See Section IV.A.5. A recent survey of members of the Society for Corporate Governance (SCG) regarding the
state of U.S. climate risk disclosures revealed that companies are using many of the existing frameworks to
present emissions, environmental data, and other information on ESG issues. Many of the respondents indicated
that their companies are now reporting using CDP, GRI, SASB and other standards, with corporate registrants
expressing a desire for greater clarity regarding how to make adequate climate disclosures. The survey results
indicate that many companies are grappling with how best to provide useful information to investors regarding
complex and interrelated risks. See Richard Mahony and Diane Gargiulo, The State of Climate Risk Disclosure:

839 A past study using ESG disclosure data in Bloomberg on US-listed firms, found that, on average, from 2007 to
2015, firms provided only about 18% (median: 13%) of the prescribed SASB disclosure items (which serve as
benchmark for financially material disclosures). See J. Grewal, C. Hauptmann and G. Serafeim, Material

information that is more comparable, consistent, and reliable and presented in a centralized
location.
C. Benefits and Costs
Below we discuss the anticipated economic effects that may result from the proposed
rules. Where possible, we have attempted to quantify these economic effects, including the
benefits and costs. In many cases, however, we are unable to reliably quantify these potential
benefits and costs. For example, existing empirical evidence does not allow us to reliably
estimate how enhancements in climate-related disclosure affect information processing by
investors or firm monitoring. Nevertheless, there is a large body of studies examining the effects
of corporate disclosure in general, as well as a subset focusing on sustainability-related
disclosures (e.g. ESG- or CSR-related disclosures).840 We draw on existing empirical evidence
and theoretical arguments from these studies to the extent they are applicable to disclosures on
climate-related information specifically.
Similarly, we qualitatively describe the factors that may affect disclosure costs but we are
unable to accurately quantify these costs. Costs related to preparing climate-related disclosures
are generally private information known only to the issuing firm, hence such data are not readily
available to the Commission. There is also likely considerable variation in these costs depending
on a given firm’s size, industry, complexity of operations, and other characteristics, which makes
comprehensive estimates difficult to obtain.
We encourage commenters to provide us with relevant data or empirical evidence related
to the costs of preparing climate-related disclosures and, more generally, to provide us with any

and Literature Review, REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 1-73 (2021).
334
type of data that would allow us to quantitatively assess the costs and benefits of the proposed
rules.
1. Benefits
The primary benefit of the proposed rules is that investors would have access to more
comparable, consistent, and reliable disclosures with respect to registrants’ climate-related risks.
As discussed in the previous sections, investors currently face obstacles in accessing comparable,
consistent, and reliable climate-related information due to a combination of registrants not
disclosing this information at all, or registrants disclosing this information but with varying
degrees of coverage and specificity and in varying formats and locations, including company
websites, standalone reports, and SEC filings.
Investors are expected to benefit from the required disclosures given that material
climate-related information would be provided to the market more consistently across registrants
of different sizes and filer status, whether domestic or foreign issuers, and regardless of industry.
Investors are also expected to benefit from the more consistent content of the disclosures.
Specifically, the proposed rules would enhance comparability by requiring registrants to provide
disclosures on a common set of qualitative and quantitative climate-related disclosure topics in
their filings.
In addition to the standardized content, investors are expected to benefit from a common
location of the disclosures in regulatory filings. The proposed rules would require registrants to
place all relevant climate-related disclosures in Securities Act or Exchange Act registration
statements and Exchange Act annual reports in a separately captioned “Climate-Related
Disclosure” section, or alternatively, to incorporate by reference from another section, such as
Risk Factors, Description of Business, or MD&A. By mandating that standardized climate-
335
related information be disclosed, and requiring it to be placed in a centralized location within
regulatory filings, the proposed rules could reduce investors’ search costs and improve their
information-processing efficiency. These factors can also lead to positive information
externalities – as more firms disclose how measures of climate risk affect their business
operations, investors would gain a better understanding of how those same climate risks may
affect other similar firms.841
Furthermore, by requiring this information to be filed with the Commission as opposed to
posted on company websites or furnished as exhibits to regulatory filings, the proposed rules are
expected to improve the reliability of information provided to investors moving forward.842
Several commenters indicated that the treatment of climate-related disclosures as filed would
help improve investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of such disclosures.
843
Recent academic work provides evidence of firms’ engagement in obfuscation and other
misleading efforts (so-called “greenwashing”)844 to manipulate the set of information available
on corporate websites and sustainability reports with the goal of attaining higher ESG ratings,
which are relied upon, in particular, by unsophisticated investors for the value of institutional
841
 One study documents how investors can use information from one firm to make inferences of other similar firms
in the context of earnings announcements. See supra note 811.
842 By proposing to treat the proposed required climate-related disclosures as “filed,” we are therefore subjecting
them to potential liability under Exchange Act Section 18, except for disclosures made on Form 6-K. The
proposed filed climate-related disclosures would also be subject to potential Section 11 liability if included in or
incorporated by reference into a Securities Act registration statement. See Section II.C.4 (discussions within).
843 See Section II.H.k.
844 A review of several academic papers reveal that there is no universally accepted definition of “greenwashing.”
Though the term “greenwashing” is often used in industry discussions regarding ESG, the Commission does not
define “greenwashing” in this proposal, rules, or form amendments. Greenwashing is typically described as the
set of activities conducted by firms or funds to falsely convey to investors that their investment products or
practices are aligned with environmental or other ESG principles.
336
certification.845 Direct disclosures may also reduce reliance on these ESG ratings, which are not
necessarily standardized nor fully transparent with respect to their methodologies. In fact, several
studies found low correlations of classifications across ESG providers.846 Additionally, a study
suggested that models and metrics used by ESG providers for appropriately classifying funds are
not always transparent and consistent across ESG providers.847
As discussed in Section IV.B.1, surveys of institutional investors indicate that climate
risk is one of the most prominent issues driving their investment decisions and engagements with
companies. Evidence from the stock market response appears consistent with this, with increased
mandatory ESG disclosure being associated with aggregate stock price movement.848 Such stock
price effects tend to display cross-sectional heterogeneity with, for example, firms disclosing
large GHG emissions experiencing price declines.849 Similar effects have also been observed in

derivatives markets.850 Investor responses in real estate markets potentially affected by physical
risks,851 as well as revealed preferences from flows into mutual funds with environmental goals
in their investment mandates,852 provide further evidence of investors’ interest in disclosures
pertaining climate risks. Taken together, the mandatory and standardized nature of the proposed
climate-related disclosures could benefit investors by improving their ability to assess these risks
and their impact on registrants’ financial condition and operations, thereby allowing investors to
make better-informed investment decisions and enhancing investor protection.
Improving and standardizing climate disclosures also could mitigate adverse selection
problems that may arise in the presence of asymmetric information853 by making more accurate
and standardized information available to the general public.854 Improved disclosure could make
it easier for investors to process information more effectively and improve the estimation of
firm’s future cash flows, leading to more accurate firm valuation.855 In particular, the enhanced
disclosures may yield further benefits for the disclosures of financial firms. Because financial
firms can have significant exposures to climate-related risks through their portfolio companies,

853 Asymmetric information occurs when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material
knowledge than the other party. Adverse selection occurs when the more knowledgeable party only chooses to
transact in settings that, based on their private information, is advantageous for them. Less informed parties
aware of their informational disadvantage might be less inclined to transact at all for fear of being taken
advantage of. See George Akerlof, The Market for ‘Lemons, Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism,

any enhancements in the portfolio companies’ disclosures can subsequently be leveraged by
these financial firms in assessing the risks to their portfolios and to the firm as a whole.856
Another benefit of the proposed rules is that it could allow firm’s shareholders to better
monitor management’s decisions and mitigate certain agency problems stemming from
management’s discretionary choices with respect to climate disclosure. Agency problems could
occur when management act opportunistically in their own self-interest at the expense of
shareholders by disclosing only certain climate-related information at their discretion. As
previously discussed in Section IV.B.2.b, management may be motivated to selectively disclose
only climate-related information,857 while omitting harder to verify risks.858 In the context of
climate-related risks, agency issues may be exacerbated by the potential conflicts between shortterm profitability and long-term climate risk horizons859 and the misalignment of interests and
856 In 2021, the CDP coordinated with 168 financial institutions, with a combined AUM of $17 trillion USD, to
engage over 1,300 companies to request climate-related information, among other topics. See CDP NonDisclosure Campaign: 2021 Results, available at https://cdn.cdp.net/cdpproduction/cms/reports/documents/000/006/069/original/CDP_2021_NonDisclosure_Campaign_Report_10_01_22_%281%29.pdf?1642510694.
857 See supra note 829 (A recent study, for example, shows that absent mandatory requirements from regulators,
voluntary disclosures following third-party frameworks are generally of poor quality and that firms making
these disclosures cherry-pick to report primarily non-material climate risk information.).

Principles and Questions (2019), available at

addition, there are a number of academic studies examining the association of climate-related disclosures with
corporate governance structures and managerial characteristics. See, e.g., M. Kılıç and C. Kuzey, The Effect of

859 Physical and transition climate risks can materialize over time horizons ranging from the immediate future to
several decades. Long horizons, for example, tend to involve changes in chronic physical risks — (sea-level
rise, drought, etc.). Shorter-term horizons may, instead, be relevant for increase in acute physical risks such as
hurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves. See ING Climate Risk Report 2020, available at

incentives between long-term shareholders and management,860 whereby the latter may unduly
focus on short-term results861 given pressures to demonstrate performance.862 Under the current
regime, many climate-related risks may be unobservable or obfuscated, giving short-termfocused managers an incentive to initiate projects exposed to these risks without properly
informing investors.
Agency problems might be exacerbated by registrants’ use of boilerplate language or
selective disclosure (i.e. “cherry picking”),863 which might reduce transparency and impair
investors’ ability to effectively monitor firm management. The lack of a standardized disclosure
framework could make it easier for registrants to forego the use of certain metrics or scopes and
omit information that might otherwise indicate shortcomings.
864 Previous studies have found that
more detailed reporting can mitigate agency problems as it facilitates the scrutiny and discipline
of firm management, allowing investors to monitor firms' operations more closely and thus

evaluate whether managers have acted in the best interests of shareholders.865 By requiring
registrants to provide comprehensive and detailed climate-related information to investors, the
proposed rules are expected to reduce the likelihood of unreliable or boilerplate disclosures. This
can enable investors to better monitor firm’s management, reducing agency problems and
ultimately strengthening investor protection. In the following sections, we discuss how specific
aspects of the proposed rules could contribute to the aforementioned benefits.
The proposed rules would mandate more detailed and comprehensive disclosure with
respect to climate-related risks. More consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures could lead
to capital market benefits in the form of improved liquidity, lower costs of capital, and higher
asset prices (or firm valuations).866
 These benefits would stem from reductions in information
asymmetries brought about by the required disclosure of climate-related information, both
among investors and between firms and their investors. In the first case, less information
asymmetry among investors could mitigate adverse selection problems by reducing the
informational advantage of informed traders. This is likely to improve stock liquidity which, in
turn, can attract more investors, thereby reducing the cost of capital. In the second case, less
information asymmetry between firms and their investors could allow investors to better estimate
future cash flows, which could reduce investors’ uncertainty, as well as the risk premium they

demand, thus lowering the costs of capital for registrants. Economic theory illustrates how, all
else equal, a drop in the cost of capital leads to a boost in equity valuation, which can further
benefit investors.
a. Disclosure Regarding Climate-Related Risks and their Impacts on
Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook
The proposed rules would require registrants to identify their climate-related risks that are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant’s business or consolidated financial
statements over the short, medium, and long-term and describe the actual and potential impacts
of those risks on its strategy, business model, and outlook. Registrants would specifically be
required to disclose impacts on, or any resulting significant changes made to, their: (i) business
operations, including the types and locations of its operations; (ii) products or services; (iii)
supply chain or value chain; (iv) activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks; and (v)
expenditures for research and development.
If, as part of its net emissions reduction strategy, a registrant uses carbon offsets or RECs,
the proposed rules would require it to disclose specific information around the role that carbon
offsets or RECs play in the registrant’s climate-related business strategy. If a registrant uses an
internal carbon price, the proposed rules would require it to disclose information around the
boundaries for measurement of overall CO2e, the price per metric ton of CO2e, as well as how
the total price is estimated to change over time, if applicable. Similarly, to the extent that the
registrant uses analytical tools such as scenario analysis, the proposed rules would require a
description of those analytical tools, including the assumptions and methods used.
The specific disclosures required by the proposed rules are expected to improve
investors’ understanding of what the registrant considers to be the relevant short-, medium-, and
342
long-term climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its
business, taking into consideration the useful life of the organization’s assets or infrastructure
and the fact that climate-related risks may manifest themselves over the medium and longer
terms. Compared to the baseline, investors would be better able to identify and assess how
climate-related risks may affect a registrant’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning in
several areas, including products and services, supply chain and/or value chain, adaptation and
mitigation activities, investment in research and development, operations (including types of
operations and location of facilities), acquisitions or divestments, and access to capital. Investors
would gain insight into how climate-related risks may serve as an input to the registrant’s
financial planning process and the time period(s) used for this process.
For example, investors may gain better insights into the registrant’s estimated costs of
any operational changes expected to be implemented to achieve emission reduction targets.
Alternatively, investors may gain valuable information on how certain climate events may
impact the registrant’s property, workforce, or its production schedule across the different
physical sites where the registrant conducts business. Adverse climate-related events may impact
the useful lives and/or valuation reserves of balance sheet assets. For example, sea level
increases and other climate related patterns may adversely impact the estimated useful lives of
coastal facilities. Similarly, more extreme weather patterns may adversely impact agricultural
regions and the value of related equipment and lands. This information is expected to be useful
for investors in assessing how climate-related risks are managed, and whether and how these
risks may affect a registrant’s financial condition and results of operations. The required
disclosure around the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in the registrant’s climate-related
business strategy could help investors better understand that strategy, including how resilient it is
343
to changes in costs or the availability or value of offsets or RECs over the short, medium and
long-term. The required disclosures around internal carbon price, when used by a registrant,
could provide investors with more standardized and detailed information regarding how the
registrant developed a particular business strategy and help investors assess whether a
registrant’s internal carbon pricing practice is reasonable and whether its overall evaluation and
planning regarding climate-related factors is sound. The required disclosure around the
assumptions and methods used by a registrant when employing analytical tools or conducting
scenario analysis can improve investors’ assessment of the resiliency of a registrant’s strategy
and business model in light of foreseeable climate-related risks and improve investors’ ability to
compare said resiliency among registrants.
The proposed requirement to identify material climate-related risks over the short-,
medium-, and long-term could also help mitigate agency problems deriving from the potential
misalignment of planning horizons between the firm’s shareholders and its managers. The
information required to be disclosed about the firm’s business operations, products or services,
supply or value chain, activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, and expenditure for
research and development could allow investors to assess how climate-related issues may impact
the registrant’s financial performance (e.g., revenues, costs) and financial condition(e.g., assets,
liabilities). These disclosures should allow investors to gain valuable insights on how resources
are being used by management to mitigate climate-related risks and to facilitate investors’
evaluation of whether managers are taking appropriate steps to address such risks.
b. Governance Disclosure
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose information concerning the
board’s oversight of climate-related risks as well as management’s role in assessing and
344
managing those risks. The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether any
member of its board of directors has expertise in climate-related matters and the processes and
frequency by which the board discusses climate-related factors. When describing management’s
role in assessing and managing climate-related factors, a registrant would be required to disclose
whether certain management positions are responsible for assessing and managing climaterelated factors and the processes by which the responsible managers are informed about and
manage climate-related factors.
The disclosures required by the proposed rules should enable investors to better
understand how the firm is informed about climate-related factors and how frequently the firm
considers such factors as part of its business strategy, risk management, and financial oversight.
Investors would be expected to gain better information around whether the organization has
assigned climate-related responsibilities to management-level positions or committees and, if so,
whether those responsibilities include assessing and/or managing climate-related risks. As a
result, investors may be better able to understand and evaluate the processes by which
management is informed about and monitors climate-related risks. For example, investors may
be better positioned to assess whether and how the firm’s board and management consider
climate-related risks when reviewing and guiding business strategy and major plans of action,
when setting and monitoring implementation of risk management policies and performance
objectives, and when reviewing and approving annual budgets.
With detailed information about climate expertise among the registrant’s directors,
investors could more effectively evaluate the firm’s governance practices related to the
identification and management of climate-related risks. In particular, investors may be able to
exercise closer oversight of management’s actions as they assess implementation of risk
345
management policies and performance objectives, review and approve annual budgets, and
oversee major capital expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures.
c. Risk Management Disclosure
The proposed rules would require registrants to describe their processes for identifying,
assessing, and managing climate-related risks. This includes disclosure on how registrants assess
materiality, whether they consider likely future regulatory actions, how they prioritize, mitigate,
or adapt to climate-related risks, and overall how climate-related factors are integrated into the
registrants’ risk management systems or processes. Registrants would also be required to provide
detailed descriptions on any transition plans,867 as applicable, including relevant targets and
metrics, how physical and transition risks are managed, and actions taken and progress made
toward the plan’s targets or goals.868
The disclosures required by the proposed disclosures could inform investors regarding
how proactive and diligent registrants may be with respect to climate-related risks. Investors can
use this information to acquire a more detailed understanding of how resilient registrants’ risk
management systems may be towards climate-related risks, which could contribute to betterinformed investment or voting decisions. These disclosures could allow investors to better
monitor and assess whether registrants have in place adequate risk management systems and
whether they are aligned with investor preferences.
867 Transition plans would be defined as a registrant’s strategy and implementation plan to reduce climate-related
physical and transition risks and increase climate-related opportunities, including by reducing its own
emissions. If the registrant has made a public commitment to reduce its GHG emissions by a certain date, it
must disclose such date and its plan to achieve its public commitment.
868 See Section IV.C.1.f for a more detailed discussion of the potential benefits of targets and goals disclosure.
346
Conversely, investors may be better able to detect whether certain registrants’ risk
management systems would fail to account for certain types of climate factors such as change in
consumer preferences, adjustments of business models, and technological challenges or
innovations, which may have implications on companies’ operations and financial conditions.
These disclosures may also allow investors to assess whether registrants are evaluating these
risks over specific time horizons, which may be particularly relevant in cases in which
management may be more concerned with short-term performance while neglecting longer term
risks. Accordingly, this provision could help address agency problems related to the
misalignment of planning horizons.
d. Financial Statement Metrics
The proposed rules would require registrants to disclose certain disaggregated climaterelated metrics in its financial statements under the following categories: (i) financial impact
metrics; (ii) financial expenditure metrics; and (iii) financial assumptions. The proposed rules
would require a registrant to disclose the impact of climate-related events (severe weather events
and other natural conditions and physical risks identified by the registrant) and transition
activities (including transition risks identified by the registrant) on its consolidated financial
statements, if the disclosure threshold is met. For each type of metric, the provisions would
require the registrant to disclose contextual information to enable the reader to understand how it
derived the metric, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used to calculate
the specified metrics, thus providing the necessary transparency for facilitating investors’
understanding and peer comparisons. To avoid potential confusion and to maintain consistency
with the rest of the financial statements, the proposed financial statement metrics would be
required to be calculated using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest
347
of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements included in the filing. The proposed rules
would specify the basis of calculation for the climate-related financial statement metrics and
clarify how to apply these accounting principles when calculating the climate-related financial
statement metrics.
With respect to financial impact metrics, the proposed rules would require a registrant to
disclose the impacts arising from climate-related events, including physical risks identified by
the registrant and severe weather events and natural conditions, such as flooding, drought,
wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise. In addition to physical risks, registrants also
would be required to disclose the financial impact of transition activities (including transition
risks identified by the registrant), such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate
exposure to transition risks on any relevant line items in the registrant’s consolidated financial
statements. The proposed rule would require registrants to reflect the impact of the climaterelated events or transition activities on each line item of the registrant’s consolidated financial
statements (e.g., line items of the consolidated income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow
statement) unless the aggregate impact of the events and transition activities is less than one
percent of the total line item. By exempting such line item reporting when the aggregate impact
of the events is less than one percent, the proposed rule would reduce overall costs for firms
associated with disclosures for instances where the impact is likely to be quite small, while
providing assurance to investors that more significant impacts are reflected in line item
reporting.
869
869 The choice of a one percent threshold is consistent with what the Commission currently uses in other contexts
for disclosure of certain items within the financial statements and without (e.g., §§ 210.5-03.1(a), 210.12-13,
and 229.404(d)).
348
We expect that the proposed financial statement metrics impact would provide additional
transparency into the nature of a registrant’s business and the significance of many of the
climate-related risks and impacts on its overall financial condition. Such disclosures are expected
to provide investors with valuable insights into potential changes to, among others, revenue or
costs from disruptions to business operations or supply chains; impairment charges and changes
to the carrying amount of assets due to the assets being exposed to physical risks; revenue or cost
due to new emissions pricing or regulations resulting in the loss of a sales contract and;
operating, investing, or financing cash flow from changes in upstream costs, such as
transportation of raw materials. Separately reporting the financial statement impacts from the
specified climate-related events and transition activities could improve comparability of both the
registrant’s year-to-year disclosure and between the disclosures of different registrants. Because
the risks presented by the climate-related events and transition activities may be correlated across
different registrants and across time, future climate-related risks could manifest in such a way
that a large subset of registrants are affected, making them potentially a non-diversifiable risk. In
this case, separate financial impact disclosures could inform investors of their exposure to these
risks not just for a single registrant, but across all the registrants in their portfolios. Such
disclosures could be beneficial as they would be informative of both individual registrant
exposures to climate-related risks, and the level of climate-related risks in the aggregate, thus
allowing investors to more effectively evaluate and manage the risk of their entire portfolio. .
Moreover, to the extent that registrants are not aware of climate-related risks in the aggregate,
these disclosures would allow for a greater understanding of the climate-related risks they face,
providing them the opportunity to make more informed investment decisions taking into account
such risks.
349
With respect to financial expenditure metrics, the proposed rules would require a
registrant to disclose the positive and negative impacts associated with the same climate-related
events and transition activities as the proposed financial impact metrics. The expenditure metrics
would require a registrant to separately aggregate amounts of expenditure expensed and
capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented. For each of those categories, a
registrant would be required to disclose separately the amount incurred during the fiscal years
presented toward positive and negative impacts associated with the specified climate-related
events and to mitigate exposure to transition risks. The expenditure metrics would also be subject
to the same disclosure threshold as the financial impact metrics, which should promote
consistency and clarity.
Together, these disclosures are expected to provide investors with information about the
total expenditure toward or capitalized costs incurred for specified climate-related events. As
such, they are expected to increase the resilience of assets or operations, retire or shorten the
estimated useful lives of impacted assets, relocate assets or operations at risk, or otherwise
reduce the future impact of severe weather events and other natural conditions on business
operations. The proposed rules also would provide investors with information about the amount
of expenditure expensed or capitalized costs incurred for climate-related transition activities
related, among others, to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets,
infrastructure, or products that are intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy
efficiency, or improve other resource efficiency.
With respect to financial assumptions, the proposed rules would require registrants to
disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce the consolidated financial
statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from,
350
severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme
temperatures, and sea level rise. If so, the registrant would be required to provide a qualitative
description of how such events have impacted the development of the estimates and assumptions
used to prepare such financial statements. Similarly, if the estimates and assumptions were
impacted by potential transition risks, the registrant would be required to provide a qualitative
description of how the development of the estimates and assumptions were impacted by such a
transition. We expect that the proposed disclosures would provide transparency to investors on
the impact of climate-related events and transition activities on the estimates and assumptions
used by the registrant to prepare the financial statements and allow investors to evaluate the
reasonableness of the registrant’s estimates and assumptions.
Prior evidence shows that existing climate-related disclosures often contain boilerplate
language or are “cherry-picked” to present information that is favorable to the company.870
Accordingly, registrants under the current regulatory regime may choose to provide only brief,
qualitative descriptions of certain climate-related factors while omitting concrete, quantitative
information on how climate-related factors can impact individual financial statement line items.
The proposed rule may mitigate these types of agency problems by requiring registrants to
disclose specific, quantitative metrics according to standardized scopes and methodologies,
thereby helping investors processing information more effectively.
The proposed financial metrics would be part of the financial statements and thus audited
by an independent public accounting firm in accordance with existing Commission rules and
870 See supra note 829 and 806.
351
PCAOB auditing standards.871 Subjecting these climate-related disclosures to reasonable
assurance pursuant to an audit would require the auditor to assess the risk of material
misstatement related to the estimates and judgments, including through evaluation of the method
of measurement and reasonableness of the assumptions used, and to understand management’s
risk management processes, including the accuracy of the proposed disclosure, thereby
alleviating possible concerns about the data’s reliability and comparability, and improving
investor confidence in such disclosure.872 Academic research finds that assurance procedures can
increase the relevance and reliability of disclosures, particularly for those involving significant
estimation uncertainties. 873
e. GHG Emissions Metrics
The proposed rules would require all registrants to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG
emissions. Given the possibility of a transition to a lower-carbon economy, investors and other
market participants may be concerned about registrants that have high GHG emissions since
these registrants may be more exposed to certain transition risks, such as regulations that restrict
emissions or the potential impacts of changing consumer preferences or market conditions.
Should a transition to a low-carbon economy gain momentum, registrants with higher amounts of
871 Such audits could increase the probability of discovering and penalizing any misrepresentation. Since this
would increase the expected costs of engaging in misrepresentation, as discussed in Section IV.B.2, this would
also be likely to increase the odds of accurate revelation of material information.
872 See Section II.F.5.
873 See M. DeFond and J. A. Zhang, A Review of Archival Auditing Research, 58(2-3) Journal of Accounting and
Economics 275-326 (2014); V.K. Krishnan, The Association Between Big 6 Auditor Industry Expertise and the
Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings 20 Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance 209-228 (2005); W.
Kinney and R. Martin, Does Auditing Reduce Bias in Financial Reporting? A Review of Audit-Related
Adjustment Studies, 13 AUDITING: A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY 149-156 (1994); K.B. Behn, J.H. Choi,
and T. Kang, (2008), Audit Quality and Properties of Analyst Earnings Forecasts 83 THE ACCOUNTING REVIEW

Impax Asset Management; San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System; and UNEP-FI.
352
Scope 1 and 2 emissions may be more likely to face sharp declines in cash flows, either from
greater costs of emissions or the need to scale back on high-emitting activities, among other
reasons, as compared to firms with lower amounts of such emissions.
Understanding the extent of this potential exposure to transition risks could help investors
in assessing their risk exposures with respect to the companies in which they invest. Greater
consistency in emissions disclosures can further benefit investors as it can facilitate comparisons
between the registrants and their peers and assist in understanding the overall risk of their
portfolios. As described below, emissions disclosures would also help inform investors about
the extent to which a company has been or is following through with its disclosed strategies and
transition plans. As further discussed in Section IV.D, we expect this provision to lower
uncertainty for investors, thereby reducing the cost of capital. This may make it easier to raise
equity and debt, or to obtain loan financing.
Besides the direct risk to cash flows through cost of emissions or the need to scale back
on high-emitting activities, such a transition could also cause a registrant’s assets to suffer from
unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations, and/or adverse adjustments in reserves.
The proposed Scope 1 and 2 emission disclosures would allow investors to identify registrants
whose assets may be more likely to become obsolete or non-performing or lose economic value
ahead of their anticipated useful life due to a potential transition to a lower-carbon economy, and
more generally allow investors to discern whether certain investments are unlikely to earn the
anticipated economic return due to such transition. The proposed disclosures would also allow
investors to more closely monitor whether a firm’s management is properly accounting for the
impairment of such stranded assets to ensure that they are recorded on the balance sheet as a loss
of profit and are not carried at more than their recoverable amount. Given the significant
353
possibility that Scope 1 and 2 emissions will affect the valuation of the registrant through
impacts on earnings, cost of capital, investor demand, or potentially some other channel, investor
protection would be enhanced by requiring disclosure of this information.
Moreover, by specifying that the information should be provided by all registrants,
investors would benefit from having access to a more comprehensive set of emissions data
against which to measure a registrant’s progress in meeting any stated emissions goals or
otherwise managing its climate-related risks, as a part of assessing the registrant’s overall
business and financial condition. In the absence of the proposed rules, some registrants may
choose to selectively omit quantitative emissions metrics. The resulting state of disclosures is
less meaningful and less transparent, making it significantly more difficult for investors to assess
the degree of risk in individual firms, to compare across firms, and to value securities.
As discussed in Section IV.A, some registrants currently report emissions via the EPA’s
2009 mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.
874 However, the nature of the reporting
requirements and the resulting data is more suited to the purpose of building a national inventory
of GHG emissions, not of assessing emissions-related risks to individual registrants. Specifically,
direct emitters must report their emissions at the facility-level (not registrant-level) and suppliers
of certain products must report their “supplied emissions,” conditional on these emissions
exceeding a specified threshold.
875 In addition, as previously discussed, the EPA emissions data
does not allow a clean disaggregation across the different scopes of emissions for a given
registrant.876 From the point of view of an investor seeking greater information regarding a
874
 See Section IV.A.3.
875 See supra note 737.
876
 See Section IV.A.3.
354
registrant, the EPA’s emissions data may be difficult for investors to use, because the data are
made public by facility and not by company. While each facility is matched to its parent
company, this company may not be the entity registered with the SEC and thus of interest to
investors. Taken together, the EPA emissions data is not well suited to enabling investors to fully
assess the degree to which each registrant is exposed to transition risks.
The proposed rules would result in more comprehensive and tailored emissions
information by requiring disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2, and in some cases Scope 3 emissions by
registrants in SEC filings. Prior evidence has shown that when information that is already
publicly available elsewhere is included within SEC filings, the public becomes more aware of
the information.877 While there are numerous differences with regard to EPA reporting, this
evidence suggests that even were these differences not to exist, and the only change were to be
inclusion in SEC filings, there would nonetheless be an advantage in improving consistency and
reliability and decreasing search costs.
The proposed rules would also provide informational benefits beyond the voluntary
disclosure of emissions in sustainability reports. While currently disclosed information reflects
investor demand, the overall information disclosed to the market may be biased due to its
voluntary nature, in that companies that have more favorable data (e.g., lower emissions) may be
more likely to make these voluntary disclosures. Requiring all registrants to provide consistent
disclosures, as proposed, would reduce the bias that can result from a voluntary regime.
Moreover, as discussed above, locating the information in SEC filings may make it more
accessible to investors and contribute to greater consistency and reliability.
877 See H.B. Christensen, E. Floyd, L.Y. Liu, and M Maffett, The Real Effects of Mandated Information on Social
Responsibility in Financial Reports: Evidence from Mine-Safety Records, 64 (2-3) JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING
AND ECONOMICS 284-304 (2017).
355
Specific provisions are designed to facilitate comparability across registrants and
industries. For example, requiring the disclosure of GHG intensity in terms of metric tons of
CO2e per unit of total revenue and per unit of production would allow investors to directly assess
the efficiency of the registrant’s operations and compare across different industries and firms of
varying size. Increased standardization in the reporting of these metrics may allow investors to
assess more effectively a registrant’s transition risk against that of its competitors. As another
example, the proposed rules would require a registrant to set the organizational boundaries for its
GHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities, operations, assets, and other
holdings within its business organization structure as those included in its consolidated financial
statements. Requiring a consistent approach would avoid potential investor confusion about the
reporting scope used in the financial statements and enhance comparability across registrants,878
helping investors in assessing a registrant’s transition risk against that of its competitors.
The proposal would also require non-SRC registrants to disclose Scope 3 emissions if
material or if the registrant has a target or goal related to Scope 3.879 In addition, specified
registrants would also be required to disclose the methodology used to compute emissions, the
breakdown of the different GHGs, as well as upstream and downstream activities, and data
quality.880 Scope 3 emissions GHG emissions can represent the majority of the carbon footprint
878 Unlike the GHG Protocol, which currently provides different options for setting organizational boundaries, the
proposed rules would require that the scope of consolidation and reporting be consistent for financial data and
GHG emissions data.
879 The proposed rules include a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosure from certain forms of liability under
the federal securities laws.
880 In calculating Scope 3 emissions, registrants have the flexibility to choose a methodology they deem fit,
however, the specific methodology must be disclosed. Estimates or ranges are permitted. Emissions reporting
must be presented as CO2e as well as disaggregated into the different types of GHGs.
356
for many companies, in some cases as high as 85% to 95%.881 For example, according to Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI), the Scope 3 emissions of the integrated oil and gas
industry are more than six times the level of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.882 Companies may have
indirect control over their Scope 3 emissions through choices they make, for example in
selecting suppliers, designing products, or sourcing inputs more efficiently. Nevertheless, the
majority of companies do not typically report this information. As of July 10, 2020, for example,
within the sample of companies belonging to the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI),883
the total Scope 3 average intensity was almost three times greater than the combined Scope 1 and
2 intensity. Yet, only 18% of constituents of the MSCI ACWI IMI reported Scope 3 emissions,
with even lower reporting percentages when looking at the individual Scope 3 categories.884
The reporting of Scope 3 emissions for these registrants would provide additional
benefits for investors. Scope 3 emissions information may be material in a number of situations
to help investors gain a more complete picture of the transition risks to which a registrant may be
exposed. Relative to registrants with substantial Scope 1 and 2 emissions, future regulations that
restrict emissions may impact registrants with high Scope 3 emissions differently. In certain
industries, a transition to lower-emission products or processes may already be underway,

triggered by existing policies, a shift in consumer preferences, technological changes, or other
market forces.
Registrants with significant Scope 3 emissions may be more likely to face disruptions not
only in their cash flows, but also in their business models or value chains to the extent that these
registrants are compelled to make changes in their products, suppliers, distributors, or other
commercial partners.885 Moreover, if consumer demand changes to favor less carbon intensive
products, companies with high Scope 3 emissions may see a marked reduction in demand for
their products, and companies that are not aware of these risks could be less profitable relative to
those that understand these risks and are prepared to mitigate them. Alternatively, companies that
can source inputs that involve less GHG emissions could achieve potential cost savings and those
that could produce products that generate less GHG emissions by the end user could potentially
enjoy higher demand. Some registrants may plan to shift their activities to capitalize on these
changes and thus may need to allocate capital to invest in lower emissions equipment or to create
new types of products. Investors would need information about the registrants’ full GHG
emissions footprint and intensity to determine and compare how exposed a registrant is to the
financial risks associated with a transition to lower-carbon economy.
Over the last few years, a number of studies have shown that firms try to reduce their
local carbon footprints by outsourcing their carbon emissions to suppliers in states or countries
885 Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions represents a substantial portion of global GHG emissions. For
example, according to a recent report, Scope 3 downstream emissions that happen after a product or service
leaves a company’s control/ownership represented about 49 % of global GHG emissions in 2019. Capital goods
(87%), banks (81%) and retailing (80%) were among the industries with the highest percentage of Scope 3
downstream emissions relative to their total emissions. These downstream emissions can come from a variety of
sources. For example, capital goods activities include emissions from raw material manufacturing and transport.
Banks emit few GHGs to run their operations, — but finance the emissions of other companies through loans
and investments. See State of Green Business 2021, available at
https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/state-of-green-business-2021.
358
with weaker environmental policies.886 These studies provide evidence of the substitutional
relationship between direct and outsourced GHG emissions. Recent studies have also analyzed
the substitution effects between Scope 1 and Scope 3 GHG emission activities of U.S. firms. The
findings show that the relative share of Scope 1 emissions out of a firm’s total emissions tend to
fall at the expense of the rising proportion of its supplier-generated Scope 3 emissions and that a
firm’s imports further augment the substitutional relationship between its Scope 1 and Scope 3
emissions.887 In addition to the outsourcing incentives related to regulatory arbitrage, the authors
of these studies posit that firms may also be outsourcing emissions abroad to exploit investors’
current difficulties in assessing the firm’s carbon emissions through imports along the upstream
supply chain. By requiring the disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions, the proposed rules would
make it more difficult for non-SRC registrants to avoid investors’ scrutiny by outsourcing all or
part of their activities abroad.
Finally, as described in Section IV.A5.d, many companies have set emissions targets, and
it is not always clear whether these targets pertain to Scope 3 emissions or not. As explained in
Section IV.C.1.g, registrants would be required to disclose whether the targets pertain to Scope 3
emissions, and as described above, if they do, they would need to report such emissions.
Without reporting of Scope 3 emissions amounts and categories, investors would not have the
information they need to understand the scale and scope of actions the company may need to

359
take to fulfill its commitment, and thus the overall financial implications of a registrant’s targets.
For example, a registrant’s disclosure of its Scope 3 emissions, together with the proposed
financial statement metrics, could allow investors to assess the potential (additional) investments
the registrant may need to make to meet a certain goal. Moreover, as described further below,
reporting of Scope 3 emissions gives a quantitative metric for investors to track, thus reducing
opportunities for misleading claims on the part of the registrant.
Because the value of a firm’s equity is largely derived from expected future cash flows,
disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions can help investors incorporate risks associated with
such future cash flows into asset values today. Indeed, the academic literature indicates that
equity is a long-term asset, meaning that even risks related to regulatory changes in the distant
future could be priced today.888 Thus, for many registrants, reasonable investors may view GHG
emissions as necessary to assess the registrants’ exposure to climate-related risks, particularly
transition risks, and whether they have developed strategies to reduce their carbon footprint in
the face of potential regulatory, policy, and market constraints. This may be particularly
important in light of the investor demand documented in IV.B.1 and the potential price impact,
as discussed in IV.D.

Rates (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3789220. Both of these papers
find that the Macauley duration of equity, the weighted average length of time which investors will receive the
cash flows from the asset, is in excess of 35 years as of 2019. This indicates that changes in cash flows in the
distant future can impact equity prices today.

f. Assurance of GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures for large
accelerated filers and accelerated filers
The proposed rules would require registrants that are large accelerated filers and
accelerated filers to provide an attestation report for the registrant’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG
emissions disclosures. Large accelerated filers constitute approximately 31% of the universe of
registrants that filed annual reports during calendar year 2020 (1,950 out of 6,220), but account
for 93.6% of market cap within the same universe. Accelerated filers constitute approximately
10% of the universe of registrants that filed annual reports during calendar year 2020 (645 out of
6,220) and account for 0.9% of market cap within the same universe.
The proposed rules provide specific transition periods for obtaining attestation reports.
Large accelerated filers would be required to provide Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures in the
fiscal year immediately following rule adoption. Next, they would be required to obtain limited
assurance over these disclosures in fiscal years 2 and 3 after adoption. They would then be
required to obtain reasonable assurance over these disclosures in fiscal year 4 after adoption and
going forward. Accelerated filers would follow the same timeline but with a delay of one fiscal
year. Specifically, accelerated filers would be required to provide Scopes 1 and 2 emissions
disclosures in fiscal year 2 after adoption. Next, they would be required to obtain limited
assurance over these disclosures fiscal years 3 and 4 after adoption. They would then be required
to obtain reasonable assurance over these disclosures in fiscal year 5 after adoption and going
forward.
The proposed transition periods for assurance over large accelerated filers’ and
accelerated filers’ Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emission disclosures are intended to provide these
registrants time to familiarize themselves with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements,
361
develop the relevant DCP, and provide the market with an opportunity to develop enough
expertise to satisfy the increased demand for GHG emission assurance services. We expect that
during the proposed transition periods, the market for assurance services would further mature
with respect to institutional knowledge, procedural efficiency, and overall competition, thus
lowering costs for registrants and improving the quality of service. Although Scope 3 GHG
emissions can constitute a large portion of a registrant’s total emission, the proposed rules would
exclude Scope 3 GHG emission disclosures from the attestation requirement due to the unique
challenges associated with their measurement, which is based on data sources not owned by the
registrant,
889 as well as the potential higher costs associated with their verification.
Section IV.A.5.e above discusses survey evidence on the frequency with which firms
obtain assurance in sustainability reports. This evidence suggests that a significant fraction of
large companies already obtain some form, albeit limited, of assurance. Practices appear to be
fragmented with respect to the levels of assurance provided, the assurance standards used, the
types of service providers, and the scope of disclosures covered by the assurance. One
consequence of such fragmentation has been a lack of clarity about the nature of assurance
provided, which can lead to confusion for investors when assessing the quality of disclosures.
Moreover, as noted above, the voluntary nature of the reporting could result in biased or
incomplete data. The fact, however, that a significant proportion of large companies already
obtain some form of assurance over this information is indicative of investors’ and companies’
need for such disclosures to be reliable.
889 See Section II.G.3.
362
The importance of assurance for climate-related information also is highlighted by the
International Federation of Accountants, which recently published its Vision for High-Quality
Sustainability Assurance.890 As discussed earlier, contrary to other quantitative information that
is provided outside of the financial statements, and which is typically derived from the same
books and records that are used to generate a registrant’s audited financial statements, GHG
emissions disclosures are not developed from information that is included in the registrant’s
books and records.
891 Accordingly, such quantitative disclosure is not be subject to audit
procedures as part of the audit of the financial statements in the same filing. Because of this, the
proposed requirement of a third-party attestation report may be particularly beneficial to verify
the reliability of such quantitative information and enhance its accuracy.. In general, subjecting
climate-related disclosures to assurance would require the assurance provider to assess the risk of
material misstatements related to the estimates and judgments, including through evaluation of
the method of measurement and reasonableness of the assumptions used, and an understanding
of management’s risk management processes, including the risks identified and the actions taken
to address those risks.892
 Moreover, by specifying minimum standards for the assurance
provided with respect to GHG Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures, we expect the proposed rules
to promote accuracy and consistency in the reporting of this information, while also providing
investors with a baseline level of reliability against which to evaluate the disclosures.

Academic research finds that assurance procedures can increase the relevance and
reliability of disclosures,894 particularly for those involving significant estimation uncertainties.
While most of this academic evidence focuses on the effects of reasonable assurance procedures,
we cannot preclude the possibility that such findings may have implications for limited assurance
as well. Experimental evidence has found that both limited and reasonable assurance can
increase perceived reliability of sustainability reports, but those same studies do not find a
statistically significant difference between limited and reasonable assurance.895
 Obtaining
assurance for sustainability reports, which as noted above is typically limited assurance, has also
been associated with firms with lower costs of capital, increased analyst coverage, and decreased
analyst forecast errors and forecast dispersion.896
The proposed rules would require the attestation report to identify the criteria against
which the subject matter was measured or evaluated, the level of assurance provided, the nature
of the engagement, and the attestation standard used. In particular, the proposed rules would

https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/65158/Sheldon_MD_D_2016.pdf. This absence of
evidence, however, is not necessarily evidence of absence. It is possible that reasonable assurance can have
benefits over limited assurance that are not easily identifiable.
896 See R.J. Casey and J.H. Grenier, Understanding and contributing to the enigma of corporate social
responsibility (CSR) assurance in the United States, 34(1) AUDITING: A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY 97,
97-130 (2015). The authors also find that the lower costs of capital are in excess of estimated assurance costs
(i.e., 5% to 10% of total audit fees) for the majority of companies. We acknowledge, however, that the benefits
cited in this study may be overstated to the extent that they reflect a selection bias. Specifically, companies that
anticipate a net loss due to assurance would choose to forgo obtaining such assurance, thereby removing
themselves from the treatment group. This potential limitation in interpreting such findings is also supported by
evidence of systematic differences in companies voluntarily reporting higher assurance levels. See C. H. Cho,
G. Michelon, D. M. Patten, and R. W. Roberts, CSR report assurance in the USA: an empirical investigation of
determinants and effects, 5(2) SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL 130, 130-

require the attestation report to include a description of the work performed as a basis for the
attestation provider’s conclusion and for that conclusion to be provided pursuant to standards
that are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the
broad distribution of the framework for public comment. We expect this provision would help
ensure that the standards upon which the attestation report is based were the result of a
transparent and reasoned process. In this way, the requirement should help to protect investors
who may rely on the attestation report by limiting the standards used to those that are appropriate
for the subject matter and purpose. Further, we expect this provision to enhance the transparency
of the GHG emissions attestation report for investors by providing them with additional
information about the general procedures undertaken by the attestation provider. For example,
under the proposed rules, an attestation report providing limited assurance would need to state
that the procedures performed vary in nature and timing from, and are less extensive than, a
reasonable assurance engagement, thus helping investors understand the level of assurance
provided.
The GHG emissions attestation report would also be required to include a statement that
describes any significant limitations associated with the measurement or evaluation of the subject
matter against the criteria. The provision would require disclosure about the estimation
uncertainties inherent in the quantification of GHG emissions, driven by reasons such as the state
of the science and assumptions used in the measurement and reporting processes. By eliciting
disclosure with respect to the procedures undertaken by the attestation provider, such as inquiries
and analytical procedures, and the methodology used in the attestation process, the proposed
provision would enhance the transparency of the GHG emissions attestation quality, thus
allowing investors to gain a better understanding of the emission related information. This could
365
help investors process emission related information more effectively. More informed investment
decisions by investors also may benefit registrants by lowering their cost of capital.
The proposed rules would also require registrants to disclose whether the attestation
provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance and whether
the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program and
record-keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions
attestation. These requirements are expected to benefit investors by helping them to better
understand the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn would
allow them to make better informed decisions about the reliability of such information.
Finally, the proposed rules would require that the GHG emissions attestation report be
prepared and signed by a provider that is an expert in GHG emissions and independent with
respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is providing the attestation report.
These qualification and independence requirements should help ensure that the attestation
provider is capable of exercising informed, objective and impartial judgment. Academic research
has found that the independence of assurance providers can be important in certain settings for
disclosure quality.897 Academic research has also found that equity prices respond to analyst
forecast even after management has released the exact same information, highlighting more
generally the perceived value of external evaluations of firm disclosures and resulting investor
confidence in the related disclosures.898
897 See N. Tepalagul, and L. Lin, Auditor Independence And Audit Quality: A Literature Review, 30(1) JOURNAL
OF ACCOUNTING, AUDITING & FINANCE 101-121 (2015) (for a more detailed discussion on academic evidence
on independence in auditing).
898 See Marco Grotteria, and Roberto Gomez Cram, Do Financial Investors Underreact To Voluntary Corporate
Disclosure? (Working Paper) (2022).
366
g. Targets and Goals Disclosure
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose whether it has set any climaterelated targets or goals and, if so, how it intends to meet those targets and goals. Such climaterelated targets or goals might relate to the reduction of GHG emissions or address energy usage,
water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration. Associated disclosure would include the
scope of activities and emissions included in the target, the unit of measurement, and the defined
time horizon. Additionally, disclosures include the baseline emissions for measuring progress,
any interim targets, how it intends to meet these targets or goals, and data showing any progress
toward achieving these targets, including how that progress was achieved, and details about any
carbon offsets of RECs that have been used.
For example, in 2019 Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge, a
commitment to net zero carbon by 2040. Since then, a growing list of major companies and
organizations have signed on to the Climate Pledge, which indicates a commitment to the
following three principles: (i) Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis;
(ii) Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement; (iii) Neutralize any
remaining emissions with additional offsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by
2040.899 The proposed rules would help to make such commitments more transparent by
requiring disclosure on the unit of measurement, time horizon, and baseline for measuring
progress, including how that progress was achieved (e.g. through efficiency improvements,
renewable energy adoption, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination
strategies).
899 As of Jan. 25, 2022, The Climate Pledge has acquired 217 signatories. See The Climate Pledge, available at
https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en/Signatories.
367
Such standardized reporting as a form of an oversight or monitoring mechanism might be
critical in overcoming agency problems in the presence of asymmetric information. Investment
in achieving targets could be value-enhancing in the long-run, but reduce cash flow in the shortrun. Companies may decide that it is an optimal strategy to bear the costs up front of shifting its
operations to those that have fewer emissions or upgrading their equipment, rather than bearing
the risk that these costs will be borne in an unpredictable and possibly disorderly way in the
future. In the absence of a means to credibly convey that efforts to achieve these long-term
targets are being undertaken diligently, however, investors might be unable to observe which
registrants are actually following through on such actions. For example, if registrants are
incurring costs in the short-run to undertake investments to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions,
reducing short-run profitability, but are unable to convey to investors that they are meaningfully
following through on achieving potential long-term value-enhancing strategies, there could be a
disincentive for investors to invest in the firm, thus undermining its value in the long-run. This
has been put forth as one potential explanation for some private sector attempts at addressing
these problems, such as green bonds, which commit firms to recurring, more standardized
disclosure requirements for progress in achieving stated targets and goals.900 The proposed rules
would provide enhanced transparency about targets and goals so that investors can identify
registrants with credible goals and track their progress over time. This can not only reduce
incentives for misleading goal disclosures, but can also allow investors to recognize goals that
generate long-term value despite short run costs, which can attract capital and increase firm
value.
900 See S. Lu, The Green Bonding Hypothesis: How do Green Bonds Enhance the Credibility of Environmental
Commitments? (2021), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3898909.
368
As explained above, the pursuit of targets could have a material impact, either in the
short-term or long-term, on a registrant’s operations or financial condition.
901 At this time,
however, there is little consistency with respect to the extent of disclosure and the relevant
details concerning such climate-related targets and goals. This can result in insufficient
information for investors’ monitoring or decision-making needs. The proposed disclosure could
provide more comparable, consistent, and reliable metrics of any climate-related targets or goals.
It would require a registrant to clearly define baselines for targets, the scope of activities and
emissions covered by the target, the unit of measurement, the defined time horizon, and how
progress is made towards the targets. For example, the disclosure would require the registrant to
state whether or not the targets pertain to Scope 3 emissions. If targets do include Scope 3
emissions, disclosure of Scope 3 emission sources and amounts would be required so that
investors would understand the scale and scope of changes the company would need to
undertake, and thus the full financial impact of meeting the target.902
 Such disclosures would
also enable investors to monitor progress firm management has made and plans to make towards
achieving climate-related targets or goals, assess the credibility of its goal, and evaluate the
effectiveness of the company’s investments to achieve its goals. As described above, this
required disclosure could make targets more credible and serves as an oversight or monitoring
mechanism.
901 See supra Sections II.G.1.b. and III C.1.e.
902 See id.
369
h. Structured Data Requirement
Under the proposed rules, the new climate-related disclosures would be tagged in the
Inline XBRL structured data language. The provision requiring Inline XBRL tagging of climaterelated disclosures would benefit investors by making those disclosures more readily available
for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other enhanced analytical methods.903 These benefits
are expected to reduce search costs and substantially improve investors’ information-processing
efficiency.
904
 XBRL requirements for public company financial statement disclosures have been
observed to reduce information-processing costs, thereby decreasing information asymmetry and
increasing transparency by incorporating more company-specific information into the financial
markets.905
 In addition, the proposed Inline XBRL requirement for the climate-related
disclosures may further limit agency problems, as XBRL requirements for financial statement
903 For example, structuring climate-related disclosures would enable more advanced analyses than those described
in the aforementioned Commission staff review that used keyword searches and NLP. See supra IV.A.5.a.
904 The findings on XBRL cited in the following paragraphs are not necessarily focused on climate-related
disclosures and metrics, but we expect the findings to be generally applicable and to result in similar benefits
for investors.
905 See, e.g., Y. Cong, J. Hao, and L. Zou, The Impact of XBRL Reporting on Market Efficiency, 28 J. INFO. SYS.

idiosyncratic information into the market and thus improves market efficiency”); Y. Huang, J.T. Parwada, Y.G.

tagging have been observed to facilitate external monitoring of firms through the aforementioned
reduction of information processing costs.906
Investors with access to XBRL analysis software may directly benefit from the
availability of the climate-related disclosures in Inline XBRL, whereas other investors may
indirectly benefit from the processing of Inline XBRL disclosures by asset managers and by
information intermediaries such as financial analysts.907 In that regard, XBRL requirements for
public company financial statement disclosures have been observed to increase the number of
companies followed by analysts, decrease analyst forecast dispersion, and, in some cases,
improve analyst forecast accuracy.908 Should similar impacts on the analysts’ informational
906 See, e.g., P.A. Griffin, H.A. Hong, J.B. Kim, and J.H. Lim, The SEC’s XBRL Mandate and Credit Risk:
Evidence on a Link between Credit Default Swap Pricing and XBRL Disclosure, 2014 AMERICAN ACCOUNTING
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING (2014) (attributing the negative association between XBRL information and
credit default swap spreads to “(i) a reduction in firm default risk from better outside monitoring and (ii) an
increase in the quality of information about firm default risk from lower information cost”); J.Z. Chen, H.A.

of firm tax avoidance, because “XBRL reporting reduces the cost of IRS monitoring in terms of information
processing, which dampens managerial incentives to engage in tax avoidance behavior”).

aggregators and academic researchers. See, e.g., N. Trentmann, Companies Adjust Earnings for Covid-19

retail investors, who have generally been observed to rely on analysts’ interpretation of financial
disclosures rather than directly analyzing those disclosures themselves.909
2. Costs
Below we discuss the anticipated direct and indirect costs of the proposed rules. Direct
costs would include compliance burdens for registrants in their efforts to meet the new disclosure
requirements. These direct costs could potentially be significant; however, the incremental costs
would be lower to the extent that registrants already provide the required disclosures. Indirect
costs may include heightened litigation risk and the potential disclosure of proprietary
information.910 We proceed by discussing these various costs.
a. Direct costs
The primary direct costs that the proposed rules would impose on registrants are
compliance costs. To the extent that they are not already gathering the information required to be
disclosed under the proposed rules, registrants may need to re-allocate in-house personnel, hire

910 For example, these costs may include the revelation of trade secrets, the disclosure of profitable customers and
markets, or the exposure of operating weakness to competing firms, unions, regulators, investors, customers or
suppliers. These costs are commonly referred to as “proprietary costs.”

conduct climate-related risk assessments, collect information or data, measure emissions (or,
with respect to Scope 3 emissions, gather data from relevant upstream and downstream entities),
integrate new software or reporting systems, seek legal counsel, and obtain assurance on
applicable disclosures (i.e., Scopes 1 and 2 emissions). In addition, even if a registrant already
gathers and reports the required information, some or all of this information may be in locations
outside of SEC filings (such as sustainability reports posted on company websites or emissions
data reported to the EPA). These registrants may face lower incremental costs by virtue of
already having the necessary processes and systems in place to generate such disclosures;
however they may still incur some additional costs associated with preparing this information for
inclusion in SEC filings.
(1) General cost estimates
In this section, we review sources that provide insight into the magnitude of the potential
costs associated with the proposed rules. With some exceptions discussed in further detail, these
sources provide information at the level of general costs for climate disclosures. We
acknowledge that these sources are limited in scope or representativeness and thus may not
directly reflect registrants’ compliance costs. For instance, some third-party sources may present
cost estimates that do not include all items required under the proposed rules (e.g., assurance
costs), or else they may aggregate the costs of multiple items (including those not required under
the proposed rules) into a single cost figure. However, these sources may serve as useful
references to the extent that they overlap with specific disclosure elements required in the
proposed rules. For example, third-party cost estimates of preparing TCFD reports or completing
the CDP questionnaire can offer a rough approximation of potential compliance costs due to their
373
similarity with the proposed rules. Below, we request further data to assist us in estimating
potential costs.
As discussed in Section V, for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(“PRA”),911 we estimate the annual costs over the first six years of compliance with the proposed
rules.912 For non-SRC registrants, the costs in the first year of compliance are estimated to be
$640,000 ($180,000 for internal costs and $460,000 for outside professional costs), while annual
costs in subsequent years are estimated to be $530,000 ($150,000 for internal costs and $380,000
for outside professional costs). For SRC registrants, the costs in the first year of compliance are
estimated to be $490,000 ($140,000 for internal costs and $350,000 for outside professional
costs), while annual costs in subsequent years are estimated to be $420,000 ($120,000 for
internal costs and $300,000 for outside professional costs). These costs are expected to decrease
over time for various reasons, including increased institutional knowledge, operational
efficiency, and competition within the market for relevant services.
One commenter provided cost estimates for their services in assisting client companies
prepare TCFD-aligned disclosures.913 For companies that have no prior experience in GHG
analysis or climate-related disclosures, the commenter estimates initial costs to range from
911 See Paperwork Reduction Act, Pub. L. No. 104-13, 109 Stat 163 (1995) (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
See infra Section V.
912
 The following estimates are applicable to registrants filing form 10-K that have no existing climate-related
disclosure processes or expertise. All estimates are rounded to the nearest $5,000.
913 See memorandum, dated Feb. 4, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global.
374
$150,000 to $200,000 to prepare TCFD-aligned disclosures.914 Companies that have already
calculated their carbon footprints and only need assistance with TCFD reporting may expect
costs of $50,000 to $200,000, with the average cost of approximately $100,000. Ongoing costs
for their services are expected to be zero conditional upon the TCFD requirements remaining
unchanged,915 however the reporting company may still incur internal costs in preparing these
disclosures on an annual basis.
Another source presents survey results of climate-related disclosure costs for three
unnamed companies, which consist of a European-based multinational large-cap financial
institution, a US-based large-cap industrial manufacturing company, and a US-based mid-cap
waste management company.916 The survey reports that each firm has “already established
robust in-house climate disclosure systems that can easily be leveraged to comply with any new
disclosure rule,” as evidenced by their concurrent reporting under multiple climate disclosure
frameworks (e.g., TCFD, CDP, SASB, GRI, etc.). The respondents indicate that anticipated
incremental costs of a mandatory climate disclosure rule are therefore expected to be minimal.917
914 This cost range pertains to clients’ use of the commenter’s “TCFD Suite”, which consists of the following
modules: benchmarking / gap assessment, management interviews, physical risk assessment, and various
transition risk assessments, including policy risk analysis, market risk assessment, technology risk assessment,
and reputation risk assessment. This cost range excludes the cost of additional services, such as target-setting
($20,000 to $30,000) and calculating GHG footprints ($75,000 to $125,000 for Scopes 1, 2, and 3), the latter of
which is discussed in further detail in the following subsection.
915 The commenter reports that should the TCFD requirements change based on new science, projections, and
business changes, costs of the TCFD Suite in future years may range from $125,000 to $175,000.
916 See L. Reiners and K. Torrent, The Cost of Climate Disclosure: Three Case Studies on the Cost of Voluntary
Climate-Related Disclosure, Climate Risk Disclosure Lab (2021), available at
https://climatedisclosurelab.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Cost-of-Climate-Disclosure.pdf.
917 Incremental costs would be minimal to the extent that the mandatory disclosure rule overlaps with their current
reporting practices. The respondents acknowledge that actual incremental costs would depend on the contents of
the final rule.
375
All respondents disclose Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, while none of them obtain third-party
assurance for their climate-related disclosures.
The mid-cap waste management company estimates that the cost of producing their first
TCFD report was less than $10,000. The company’s reported annual costs consist of employee
costs ($12,600)918 and third-party costs ($60,000 to $160,000).919 However, the reported annual
costs may be less applicable to potential compliance costs as they combine additional costs
associated with several other activities not necessarily required in the proposed rules, including
its adherence to multiple climate disclosure frameworks (e.g. TCFD, GRI, SASB, and CDP) and
designing its annual sustainability report and associated webpage.920 Overall, the company
reports that its total costs related to producing climate-related disclosures across these multiple
frameworks are less than 5% of its total SEC compliance-related costs.
The large-cap industrial manufacturing company reports that the costs of preparing its
first CDP questionnaire was no more than $50,000. Additionally, the combined costs of
producing its first TCFD, SASB, and GRI disclosures were between $200,000 and $350,000.
Reported annual costs include internal costs (between $200,000 and $350,000)921 and the cost for
918 The company allocates three employees to produce climate-related disclosures. Two employees in Legal and
Compliance devote a combined 80 hours per year on this task, while one employee in Management and
Administration devotes two hours per year.
919 The company reports that approximately one-third of these third-party costs is associated with designing the
annual sustainability report and associated webpage, while the remaining two-thirds is associated with report
writing and consulting work on the voluntary frameworks.
920 These annual costs reflect a larger scope of climate-related disclosures (e.g. multiple frameworks, sustainability
report, etc.) relative to the initial cost, which is specific to TCFD reporting only. Nevertheless, because these
estimates aggregate the costs of reporting under the TCFD in addition to other climate disclosure framework,
these estimates can serve as an upper bound of what annual costs may be specific to TCFD reporting only.
921 Internal costs include the cost of approximately 20 employees working part-time on climate-related disclosures
from Nov. until Mar. and one full-time consultant.
376
auditors and consultants ($400,000).922 These cost estimates, however, may overestimate
potential compliance costs to the extent that they include disclosure items or activities not
required in the proposed rules. The company reports that their annual costs of producing its
voluntary climate-related disclosures are less than 0.1% of their revenues.
The multinational financial institution reports that the cost of producing its first TCFD
report, SASB report, and CDP questionnaire were each less than $100,000 given that such
information overlaps with what the company already discloses under the EU’s Prospectus
Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129). The company estimates annual costs ranging from
$250,000 and $500,000 to produce these disclosures, but as before, this range may combine the
costs of activities that are not required in the proposed rules.923 Similar to the industrial
manufacturing company, this company also notes that the annual costs of producing its voluntary
climate-related disclosures are less than 0.1% of their revenues.
Some commenters also provided estimates of climate-related disclosure costs for
individual firms. One commenter provided a breakdown of such costs for seven unnamed large
cap firms across six different industries.924 Headcount requirements ranged from two to 20 fulltime equivalent employees. One large-cap firm in the energy industry reported that its TCFD
reporting process involved 40 employees and six months of nearly full-time participation by 20
core team members. Employee hours spent on climate reporting ranged from 7,500 to 10,000
annually. Fees for external advisory services ranged from $50,000 to $1.35 million annually,
922 Auditors review data quality and data collection procedures, while consultants help prepare substantive
disclosures, advise on adherence to the voluntary climate disclosure frameworks, and prepare web updates.
923 The company notes that the bulk of its annual costs comes from producing chapter 7 of its Universal
Registration Document, issued under the EU’s Prospectus Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129). Chapter 7
pertains to the extra-financial performance statement of the consolidated firm.

which generally included legal counsel and consulting services related to environmental
engineering, emissions, climate science, modeling, or sustainability reporting. Another
commenter, a Fortune 500 energy infrastructure firm, reported that it employs a full-time,
management level director that spends about 25% of his time developing sustainability reports
and other ESG initiatives. This commenter also reported that it pays a third-party consulting firm
more than $250,000 annually to assist in its ESG and sustainability report process.925
The UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, as part of its Green
Finance Strategy, has released a final stage impact assessment (the “UK impact assessment”) of
their proposed rules that would also require certain TCFD-aligned disclosures from firms and
asset managers listed on UK financial markets.926 The UK impact assessment provides a
breakdown of estimated average compliance costs per affected entity. Under the assumption that
affected entities have no pre-existing climate-related disclosure practices or expertise, the UK
impact assessment estimates that first-year one-time costs would include familiarization costs
($17,300927 plus $2,600 per subsidiary, as applicable) and legal review ($4,400). They also

estimate recurring annual governance disclosure costs ($12,500), strategy disclosure costs
($17,900928), risk management disclosure costs ($14,900), metrics and targets disclosure costs
($104,400 in the first year and $80,500 in subsequent years929), internal audit costs ($30,300),
and signposting costs ($100).930 For companies with subsidiaries, the costs of collecting
information from subsidiaries and processing this information are expected to be $4,300 for the
parent company and $1,700 for each subsidiary. In total, the study estimates that a company with
no pre-existing climate-related disclosure practices or expertise could incur costs of $201,800 in
the first year and $177,900 in subsequent years, plus additional costs due to subsidiaries, as
applicable. This cost estimation methodology is conditional upon assumptions regarding the
number of required staff, the rank or title of the staff, and the required labor hours, which are
then matched with local wage data to estimate final costs.
It is important to note that all of these cost estimates are conditional on specific
assumptions and can vary significantly depending on firm characteristics, such as firm size,
industry, business model, the complexity of the firm’s corporate structure, starting level of
internal expertise, etc. In addition, we note that, in certain cases, these cost estimates may
represent a registrant’s optimal response to investor demand, and thus may exceed the minimum
cost necessary to fulfill mandatory reporting of climate-related risks. We are accordingly
requesting comments regarding compliance costs, including cost data that can be used to

of brevity. Signposting costs refer to the “additional annual cost to those in scope to upload the required
reporting documentation and signposting to this documentation within their annual report.”
379
generate more accurate, granular, and reliable cost estimates that are more representative of the
full set of affected registrants.
(2) Cost estimates specific to emissions
In this section, we review the available evidence, which provides some insight into the
scope of the compliance costs associated with reporting GHG emissions. We are cognizant of the
type of costs that registrants will incur to report GHG emissions, e.g. resources, systems, design
and implementation of DCP, external consulting services. In light of the limited information
available, however, we are unable to fully and accurately quantify these costs. Accordingly, we
are requesting comments regarding cost data for GHG emissions reporting.
One commenter reports that their services in calculating client companies’ GHG
footprints (Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions) would initially cost $75,000 to $125,000 if the client
company has no prior experience in this area.931 Ongoing costs amount to approximately $40,000
assuming no material changes in Scope 3 emissions (i.e., assess Scopes 1 and 2 only). If there are
material changes to Scope 3 emissions, ongoing costs would range from $75,000 to $125,000
(i.e., assess Scopes 1, 2, and 3).
Another commenter, a climate management and accounting platform, provided cost
estimates of the measurement and reporting of emissions. This commenter’s estimates are
disaggregated across scopes of emissions as well as “low maturity” vs “high maturity”
companies with respect to emissions reporting. Low maturity companies are defined as those that
have no formal understanding of GHG emission calculations and have no related policies or
programs in place. Accordingly, these companies have not organized or collected any data for
931 See supra note 783. Legal and audit fees are not included in these cost estimates.
380
such a calculation. High maturity companies are defined as those that have the aforementioned
understanding, policies, programs, and data. Therefore, high maturity companies are expected to
face lower incremental costs. The commenter estimates that the average first-year startup cost of
assessing Scopes 1 and 2 emissions amount to $45,000 and $25,000 for companies of low and
high maturity, respectively. Including the assessment of Scope 3 emissions would increase the
costs by $80,000 and $25,000 for companies of low and high maturity, respectively. The
commenter indicated that it expects these costs to decrease over time as software solutions
simplify the process and reduce the burden on companies.
Additional cost estimates are provided by another commenter, which is an organization
that assists companies, communities, and other organizations in accurately assessing emissions
data across all scopes of emissions.932 According to their pricing structure, initial one-time costs
amount to $10,000, which includes identifying data input needs, developing the design and
organization of user interfaces, establishing software and IT systems, and reporting emissions
from prior years to the extent that historic data is available. Ongoing costs, which includes a
subscription fee and data management fee, amount to $12,000 plus $1,200 per building that is
covered in the calculation of emissions. Another organization that offers similar services, among
others, indicates that their fees for GHG accounting for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 can range from
$11,800 to $118,300.933 Their fees for applying the PCAF method on investment and lending
932 See memorandum, dated Jan. 21, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of Ledger8760, available
at https://www-draft.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022.htm.
933 See memorandum, dated Jan. 14, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of South Pole. These
numbers have been converted from EUR based on the 2021 average exchange rate of $1.183 USD/EUR,
rounded to the nearest $100.
381
portfolios range from $11,800 to $35,500. They note that the assessment process take
approximately 1-3 months depending on the complexity and availability of data.
The EPA has also sought to quantify the costs of measuring and reporting emissions in
accordance with the mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which generally requires
facility-level reporting of emissions from large emitters and from large suppliers of certain
products (e.g., entities that produce gasoline that will eventually be consumed downstream by the
end-user).934 The EPA estimated that the rule would impose small expected costs on the facilities
under its purview. The EPA estimated that, for most sectors, the costs represent at most 0.1% of
sales.935 For small entities,936 the EPA estimated that the costs are on average less than 0.5% of
sales. While the EPA’s emissions reporting requirements, as discussed above, may elicit some of
the information required under our proposed rules, given that the requirements are different, the
actual compliance costs would differ accordingly.
A survey conducted by PCAF provides some estimates of the costs of assessing financed
emissions.937 Financed emissions, which can be one component of Scope 3 emissions for certain
financial institutions, can be described as the emissions generated by companies in which a
financial institution invests or to which it otherwise has exposure. The PCAF survey of 18
934
 See Section IV.A.3 for more information on the EPA mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.
935 See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Sept. 2009),
available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-07/documents/regulatoryimpactanalysisghg.pdf. The
EPA notes that several facility types do not currently report emissions (or the existence of such disclosure
practices cannot be confirmed), therefore the cost estimates for these facility types reflect full start-up costs to
meet the reporting requirements.
936 The EPA defines a small entity as (1) a small business, as defined by SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR Part
121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or
special district with a population of less than 50,000; or (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit
enterprise that is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.
937 See Letter from PCAF (Dec. 21, 2021).
382
unnamed financial institutions938 found that typical staff time ranged between 50 and 100 days
and the costs for contracting external support was less than $20,000 for the majority of
respondents. These estimates may provide some sense of the costs that may be incurred by those
financial institutions that would be required to report Scope 3 emissions under the proposed
rules.
(3) Cost estimates of assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions
disclosures
Registrants that are accelerated filers and large accelerated filers will incur additional
costs in obtaining assurance of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures. The Commission estimates
these costs starting with data on these filers’ median audit fees in fiscal year 2020, which is
$989,566 and $2,781,962 for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, respectively.
939 Next,
an academic study suggests that assurance costs for sustainability reports (which serve as a
common location for climate-related information, in addition to other non-financial topics) may
range from 5% to 10% of total audit fees.940 We take the minimum, median, and maximum
percentages (5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively) and apply further adjustments based on (i)
emissions disclosures typically compromising only a portion of CSR reports, (ii) the potential fee
premium related to attestation report included in SEC filings, and (iii) the average pricing
difference between limited and reasonable assurance. For limited assurance, we estimate that
938 The 18 survey respondents consist of 2 insurance companies, 13 banks (commercial, investment, or
development), 1 asset owner, and 2 asset managers. Respondents’ asset size ranges from less than a $1bn USD
to $500bn USD. The average assets covered by this disclosure activity was approximately $5-20bn USD.
939
 Data on audit fees is from Audit Analytics, which provides all fee data disclosed by SEC registrants in
electronic filings since Jan. 1, 2000.
940
 See R.J. Casey and J.H. Grenier, Understanding and Contributing to the Enigma of Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) Assurance in the United States, 97 AUDITING: A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY 130
(2015).
383
accelerated filers will incur costs ranging from $30,000 to $60,000 (with a median of $45,000),
while large accelerated filers will incur costs ranging from $75,000 to $145,000 (with a median
of $110,000). For reasonable assurance, we estimate that accelerated filers will incur costs
ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 (with a median of $75,000), while large accelerated filers will
incur costs ranging from $115,000 to $235,000 (with a median of $175,000).
On the one hand, these estimates may underestimate actual costs as they are based on
relative costs of assurance for financial statements, and assurance on emissions may differ in
important ways. On the other hand, the costs may be lower in the future to the extent that the
market for assurance services matures with respect to institutional knowledge, procedural
efficiency, and overall competition. We request additional data that may assist in accurately
assessing the costs of obtaining assurance over emissions disclosures.
(4) Factors that affect direct costs
Incremental compliance costs may be relatively lower for registrants that already meet
some of the disclosure and tagging requirements. For instance, registrants that are currently
subject to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would face lower incremental costs in
reporting certain scopes of emissions relative to a firm that has no emissions measurement
systems in place.941 Similarly, registrants that already provide extensive qualitative disclosures
on climate-related risks, which tend to be large accelerated filers and registrants in high emission
industries,942 may face lower incremental costs in meeting certain disclosure requirements. As
discussed in Section IV.A.5.a, the Commission’s staff reviewed 6,644 recent annual reports
941 See Section IV.C.1.e for more information on how the proposed rules compare to the EPA’s emissions reporting
requirements.
942 See Section IV.A.5.a
384
(Forms 10-K, 40-F, and 20-F) and found that 33% of them contained disclosures related to
climate change, the majority of which discussed information related to business impact,
emissions, international climate accords, and physical risks. Registrants with operations in
foreign jurisdictions943 where disclosure requirements are based on the TCFD’s framework for
climate-related financial reporting, would also face lower incremental costs.944 Moreover, costs
may also be mitigated by the proposed transition period, which would allow firms to more
gradually transition to the new reporting regime.
Several industry reports also document how a sizeable portion of U.S. companies report
climate-related information under one or more third-party frameworks that are either fully or
partially aligned with the TCFD disclosure elements. For example, the CCMC survey (G&A
study) reports that among their sample of U.S. public companies, 44% (53%) use the SASB,
31% (52%) use the GRI, 29% (30%) use the TCFD, and 24% (40%) use the CDP. Moody’s
analytics provides a detailed view for a sample of 659 U.S. companies of the existing disclosure
rate across the different TCFD disclosure elements that range from a high of 45% disclosure rate
for Risks and Opportunities - Strategy (a), to a low of 5% for Risks and Opportunities - Strategy
(c) (see Table 4). Since the proposed rules are broadly consistent with the TCFD framework, we
would expect lower incremental compliance costs for registrants that provide most or all
disclosures according to the TCFD or related frameworks, including the CDP, which has fully
integrated the TCFD disclosure elements into its disclosure questionnaire, and other frameworks
and/or standards partly aligned with the TCFD recommendations.
943 E.g., Morningstar reports that over 35% of S&P 500 revenues came from foreign markets, while this percentage
is around 20% for the revenues coming from companies belonging to the Russell 2000 index. See,
https://www.morningstar.com/articles/918437/your-us-equity-fund-is-more-global-than-you-think.
944 See Section IV.A.4 for a discussion on International Disclosure Requirements.
385
Similarly, registrants in the insurance industry may also face lower incremental costs due
to their existing disclosure practices. As discussed in Section IV.A.3, a large subset of insurance
firms are required to disclose their climate-related risk assessment and strategy via the NAIC
Climate Risk Disclosure Survey. A comment by a state insurance commissioner stated that
because this survey overlaps extensively with the TCFD recommendations, these firms should be
able to easily switch to reporting via the TCFD disclosure framework.945 This is because the
proposed rules are broadly consistent with the TCFD. We expect that registrants in the insurance
industry may be able to adapt more easily to providing disclosure under these rules.
Section IV.A.5.e reports survey evidence on the frequency with which firms obtain
assurance in sustainability reports. This evidence suggests that a significant fraction of large
companies already obtain some form, albeit limited, of assurance. To the extent that large
accelerated filers and accelerated filers already voluntarily obtain some form of assurance over
their GHG emissions, these registrants would face lower incremental costs associated with
complying with the proposed rules’ assurance requirements. These registrants tend to bear
proportionately lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of
such compliance.946 Additionally, as the market for assurance matures, the Commission staff
expects these costs to decrease over time.
Incremental costs may be higher for smaller firms considering that they are less likely to
have climate-related disclosure systems and processes already in place.947
 If smaller firms were

 For example, during fiscal year 2020, median audit fees as percentage of revenue for large accelerated filers and
accelerated filers was 0.16%, while the corresponding figure for non-accelerated filers was 1.1%.
947 See supra note 760. See also discussion of the Commission staff’s review using climate-related keyword
searches in Section IV.A.5.a.

to face higher proportional fixed costs in meeting the disclosure requirements, this may
potentially put them at a competitive disadvantage to larger firms. 948 Conversely, incremental
costs for smaller firms may be lower to the extent that they have less complexity with respect to
their assets and operations, which may allow them to assess climate-risk exposures or measure
emissions at lower cost.
With respect to the Inline XBRL tagging requirements, various preparation solutions
have been developed and used by operating companies to fulfill their structuring requirements,
and some evidence suggests that, for smaller companies, XBRL compliance costs have decreased
over time.949
 The incremental compliance costs associated with Inline XBRL tagging of climaterelated disclosures would also be mitigated by the fact that filers that would be subject to the
proposed requirements would also be subject to other Inline XBRL requirements for other
disclosures in Commission filings, including financial statement and cover page disclosures in
948 Because higher proportional fixed costs for smaller firms may be particularly acute with respect to assessing
Scope 3 emissions, the proposed rules exempt SRCs from providing Scope 3 emissions disclosures. Since SRCs
are a small fraction of the market, the overall benefit to investors would not be as large as for non-SRCs, while
avoiding high fixed costs that could put them at a potential competitive disadvantage.
949 An AICPA survey of 1,032 reporting companies with $75 million or less in market capitalization in 2018 found
an average cost of $5,850 per year, a median cost of $2,500 per year, and a maximum cost of $51,500 per year
for fully outsourced XBRL creation and filing, representing a 45% decline in average cost and a 69% decline in
median cost since 2014. See M. Cohn, AICPA Sees 45% Drop in XBRL Costs for Small Companies, Accounting
Today (Aug. 15, 2018) (stating that a 2018 NASDAQ survey of 151 listed registrants found an average XBRL
compliance cost of $20,000 per quarter, a median XBRL compliance cost of $7,500 per quarter, and a
maximum, XBRL compliance cost of $350,000 per quarter in XBRL costs per quarter), available at

certain periodic reports and registration statements.950 As such, the proposal would not impose
Inline XBRL compliance requirements on filers that would otherwise not be subject to such
requirements, and filers may be able to leverage existing Inline XBRL preparation processes
and/or expertise in complying with the proposed climate-related disclosure tagging requirements.
We expect that the number of registrants committed to preparing climate-related
disclosures will increase in the future, independently from our proposed rules. As discussed in
Section IV.B.1, a sizeable and growing portion of global investors consider climate change as the
leading issue driving their engagements with companies and is demanding robust disclosure
around its impacts and the plan to mitigate climate-related risks. Consistent with this increasing
demand for climate-related information, recent trends showed an uptick in climate-related
disclosures, particularly within samples of larger firms, though not necessarily through their
regulatory filings.951 Furthermore, the market for related services (e.g., GHG accounting
services, auditors, and other consultants, etc.) may become more competitive, driving down
costs. To the extent that these trends continue in the future, we would expect that the incremental
costs for complying with the proposed rules would become lower for an increasing number of
firms.
950 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(101); 17 CFR 232.405 (for requirements related to tagging financial statements
(including footnotes and schedules) in Inline XBRL). See also 17 CFR 229.601(b)(104); 17 CFR 232.406 for
requirements related to tagging cover page disclosures in Inline XBRL. Beginning in 2024, filers of most feebearing forms will also be required to structure filing fee information in Inline XBRL, although the Commission
will provide an optional web tool that will allow filers to provide those tagged disclosures without the use of
Inline XBRL compliance services or software. See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(108) and 17 CFR 232.408; Filing Fee
Disclosure and Payment Methods Modernization, Release No. 33-10997 (Oct. 13, 2021), 86 FR 70166 (Dec. 9,
2021).
951 See Section IV.A.5
388
b. Indirect costs
In addition to the direct costs of preparing climate-related disclosures, the proposed rules
could also lead to indirect costs. For example, the proposed rules may result in additional
litigation risk since the proposed climate-related disclosures may be new and unfamiliar to many
registrants.952 The proposed rules would significantly expand the type and amount of information
registrants are required to provide about climate-related risks. Registrants unfamiliar preparing
these disclosures may face significant uncertainty and novel compliance challenges. To the
extent this leads to inadvertent non-compliance, registrants may face additional exposure to
litigation or enforcement action.
However, certain factors may mitigate this concern. First, existing and proposed safe
harbors953 would provide protection from liability for certain statements by registrants, including
projections regarding future impacts of climate-related risks on a registrant’s consolidated
financial statements and climate-related targets and goals. Second, the proposed rules would
include phase-in periods after the effective date to provide registrants with sufficient time to
become familiar with and meet the proposed disclosure requirements.954

952 See supra note 840.
953
 As previously noted, registrants would be able to use the existing safe harbors for forward-looking statements
that were added to the Securities Act and Exchange Act pursuant to the PSLRA assuming all conditions of those
safe harbor provisions are met. See supra note 219.
954 Compliance would be required in a registrant’s fiscal year ending no earlier than two years after the effective
date of any adopted rules. An additional one year phase-in would be provided for registrants that are not large
accelerated filers, while complying with Scope 3 emissions reporting would also be provided with an additional
one year phase-in.
389
Another potential indirect cost is the possibility that certain provisions of the proposed
rules may force registrants to disclose proprietary information.955 Under the proposed rules,
registrants would be required to disclose a wide range of climate-related information, including
potential impacts on its business operations or production processes, types and locations of its
operations, products or services, supply chain and/or value chain. Registrants would be further
required to disclose whether they have emissions-related targets and metrics or an internal
carbon price, and if they do, what they are. To the extent that a registrant’s business model or
strategy relies on the confidentiality of such information, the required disclosures may put the
registrant at a competitive disadvantage.
c. Other cost considerations
Although the proposed rules may impose significant compliance costs, we expect these
costs to decrease over time, both from firm-specific and market-wide contexts. From the firmspecific context, registrant disclosing climate-related information for the first time is likely to
incur initial fixed costs to develop and implement the necessary processes and controls.956 Once
the firm invests in the institutional knowledge and systems to prepare the disclosures, the
procedural efficiency of these processes and controls should subsequently improve, leading to
lower costs in following years.957

955 Proprietary costs are generally relevant for reporting that involves information about a firms’ business
operations or production processes and disclosures that are specific, detailed and process-oriented. See, e.g., C.
Leuz, A. Triantis, and T. Y. Wang, Why Do Firms Go Dark? Causes and Economic Consequences of Voluntary
SEC Deregistrations, 45(2) JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ECONOMICS 181-208 (2008); D.A. Bens, P. G.
Berger, and S. J. Monahan, Discretionary Disclosure in Financial Reporting: An Examination Comparing
Internal Firm Data to Externally Reported Segment Data, 86 (2) THE ACCOUNTING REVIEW 417-449 (2011).
956 See Letter from Financial Executives International’s (FEI) Committee on Corporate Reporting (CCR) (June 10,
2021).
957 The assumption that first year’s costs are greater than subsequent years’ is consistent with the cost estimation
models of the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the UK’s proposal of mandatory TCFD-aligned
disclosure.
390
Establishing a framework for standardized climate-related disclosures could also reduce
uncertainty for registrants over the specific content to disclose and could mitigate disclosure
burdens to the extent that it reduces information requests from third parties. Before registrants
can take any tangible steps toward preparing climate-related disclosures, they must first
determine which specific climate-related discussions, metrics, and analyses are most appropriate
to disclose – a process that, under the current regime, can involve significant uncertainty.
Furthermore, the uncertain, complex, and multidimensional nature unique to climate-related
risks, combined with the unpredictability of investor responses to such disclosures,958 can also
make it costly for management to determine the risks which meet the materiality threshold.
By implementing a standardized climate disclosure framework, the proposed rules could
potentially reduce the burden that registrants may face in the environment of diverging voluntary
frameworks and help clarify for registrants what they should disclose, where and when to make
their disclosures, and what structure or methodology to use.959 While a more principles-based
approach would provide additional flexibility for registrants, it also may impose certain costs if
they are unsure of what climate-related measures are needed to satisfy legal requirements. Such
an approach could entail additional judgment on the part of management, or result in registrants
erring on the side of caution in complex matters such as climate-related disclosures. This could
ultimately translate into spending more resources to determine appropriate compliance with the
Commission’s applicable reporting standards. The proposed rules should provide legal certainty
around climate-related disclosure and therefore mitigate the compliance burdens associated with
the existing regulatory framework.
958 See Section IV.B.2.a.(4)
959 See supra note 806.
391
Furthermore, some registrants currently receive multiple, diverse requests for climaterelated information from different parties, such as investors, asset managers, and data service
providers. Responding to such third-party request can be costly and inefficient960 and may put
significant and sometimes competing demands on registrants.961 A standardized climate
disclosure framework could potentially reduce information requests from third parties to the
extent that such requests overlap with the disclosures required under the proposed rules. We
acknowledge, however, that registrants that currently use third-party frameworks to disclose
climate-related information may incur certain costs of switching from their existing practice to
our proposed disclosure framework.
From a market-wide context, mandated climate disclosures may heighten demand for
certain data or third-party services related to preparing the required disclosures, including
assistance with the reporting of emissions data. In the short term, there could be a potential
increase in the prices of such services to extent that the initial growth in demand exceeds the
supply. In the long term, however, this heightened demand is expected to spur competition,
innovation, and other economies of scale that could over time lower associated costs for such
services and data and improve their availability. Moreover, the aggregate accumulation of
institutional knowledge may lead to a broad convergence of disclosure-related best practices,
which could further reduce the costs of the proposed disclosures. .
Overall, the market effects deriving from competition and innovation could enhance the
efficiency and availability of relevant data and services, thereby lowering costs. These positive

externalities from standard reporting practices can provide additional market-wide cost savings
to the extent that they reduce duplicative effort in the production and acquisition of
information.962
D. Anticipated Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
1. Efficiency
As discussed in Section IV.B.2, the complexity, uncertainty, and long-term nature of
climate risks make it unlikely that voluntary disclosure of such risks would be fully revealing.
Therefore, as detailed in Section IV.C.1, mandating that climate-related disclosures be presented
in a comparable and consistent manner and in a machine-readable language (Inline XBRL) is
likely to enhance the information environment for investors. In doing so, the proposed rules are
expected to improve market efficiency and price discovery by enabling climate-related
information to be more fully incorporated into asset prices. Improved efficiency could inform the
flow of capital and allow climate-related risks to be borne by those who are most willing and
able to bear them.963
These expected improvements in market efficiency are broadly consistent with empirical
research. If climate-related information is relevant for asset prices, and therefore market
efficiency, then the effective disclosure of climate-related information would be expected to
cause differential asset price/financing cost responses across firms and settings. Empirical
962 See supra note 840.
963 A recent study by McKinsey found that 85% of investors either agreed or strongly agreed that “more
standardization of sustainability reporting” would help them allocate capital more effectively, and 83% either
agreed or strongly agreed that it would help them manage risk more effectively. See Sara Bernow et. al., More
Than Values: The Value-Based Sustainability Reporting That Investors Want, MCKINSEY & COMPANY (Aug. 7,
2019), available at

393
evidence is largely consistent with this expectation. Academic studies have found evidence that
among firms that voluntarily report emissions via the CDP questionnaire, those with higher
emissions (relative to their size and industry peers) pay higher loan spreads.964 A recent report
from Lazard Ltd. also found a significant relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and a
company’s price-to-earnings ratio.965 Even in settings with mandatory disclosure, evidence is
consistent with abnormally positive stock returns on announcement date for low-emitters and
negative returns for high-emitters.966
While the disclosure of climate-related information can improve market efficiency,
investor response to such disclosures can vary depending on specific circumstances, thereby
highlighting the limitations of the aforementioned studies.967 For example, if increased disclosure
causes investors to realize that their portfolios are more exposed to climate risk than previously
known, valuations may fall and costs of capital may increase as investors reallocate capital to
balance this risk. Further, aggregate pricing effects could also be due to a better understanding of
964 See S. Kleimeier, and M. Viehs, Carbon Disclosure, Emission Levels, and the Cost of Debt, Emission Levels,
and the Cost of Debt, SSRN (2018), available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2719665.
965 See Lazard Climate Center (2021), available at https://www.lazard.com/media/451920/lazard-climate-centerpresentation-december-2021.pdf. The report examined more than 16,000 companies from 2016 through 2020
and found that investors are actively and directly pricing some transition risk into valuations, however the
effects vary significantly across different types of GHGs, market cap, and sectors. Large cap companies (>$50
billion) experience greater valuation discounts, while big emitters, such as energy companies, showed the
starkest correlation. On average, a 10% decrease in a large U.S. energy company’s emissions corresponded with
a 3.9% increase in its price-to-earnings ratio.
966 See supra note 849 (Jouvenout and Kruger, 2021).

(7) Management Science 3061-3084 (2019); See supra note 849 (Bolton and Kacperczyk, 2020). The first paper
in particular finds a negative aggregate stock market response to the passage of a mandatory ESG disclosure
rules in the EU. These results, however, should be interpreted with caution. For one, the empirical design is
based on matching, but there are reasons to believe that the treatment and control groups differ along important
dimensions. Further, there is no event study plot, and results are not shown for cumulative abnormal returns
after controlling for common risk factors like the Fama-French 3-factor model. It is therefore difficult to discern
whether the passage of the disclosure rules is actually driving the aggregate market response.
394
future regulatory risks firms face.968 Studies find, however, that cumulative abnormal stock
returns around the announcement date are negatively correlated with firms’ mandatorily
disclosed emission levels. This consistent with mandatory reporting of climate-related
information improving price discovery and market efficiency.
Empirical research has also documented evidence of market inefficiencies with respect to
climate-related risks. For example, one study finds that stock prices of food companies (i.e. food
processing and agricultural companies) may exhibit mispricing with respect to drought
exposure.969 The study documents that drought-exposed firms report reduced future profitability,
indicating that drought exposure is a financial risk. In an efficient market, this risk should result
in trading activity that decreases the current stock price and increases the expected return (to
compensate investors for bearing this risk). The study, however, finds that drought-exposed
firms deliver lower future returns relative to firms with less exposure, suggesting that the market
initially under-reacts to drought exposure. In other words, the market may fail to sufficiently
incorporate the risk of drought exposure into the current stock price, resulting in investors
holding mispriced assets and bearing risk for which they are not appropriately compensated.
Another study finds, through similar reasoning, that stock prices may exhibit mispricing with
respect to temperature changes induced by climate change.970 According to survey evidence of
global institutional investors, respondents believe that equity valuations do not fully reflect
968 For example, the passage of disclosure rules may signal more stringent enforcement of emissions rules going
forward, leading to an increase in the risk of regulation. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle the pure effect of
disclosure rules on stock performance and the cost of capital.

climate-related risks.971 Mandatory disclosures may help address these inefficiencies as it would
provide investors with the information necessary to better incorporate climate-related risks into
asset prices.
These capital market benefits can be further strengthened by the requirement to tag the
climate-related disclosures in Inline XBRL, as XBRL requirements have been observed to
reduce informational advantages of informed traders, increase stock liquidity, and reduce cost of
capital.972 These benefits may also have valuation implications. The discounted cash flow model
illustrates how, all else equal, a drop in the cost of capital leads to a boost in equity valuation,
which can further benefit investors.
There are also important efficiency implications in relation to systemic risks.973 The
increasing frequency and severity of climate events can potentially lead to destabilizing losses
for insurance companies,

975 and other financial intermediaries with direct and indirect

973 Systemic risk refers to the risk of a breakdown of an entire system, rather than simply the failure of individual
parts. In a financial context, systematic risk denotes the risk of a cascading failure in the financial sector, caused
by linkages within the financial system, resulting in a severe economic downturn.

exposures to different affected industries and assets. Some commentators state that, in addition to
physical risks, the financial system could be destabilized also by potentially rapid and
unexpected losses to carbon-intensive assets caused by a disorderly transition to a low-carbon
economy or a shift in the market’s perception of climate risks.976 With insufficient and
inconsistent disclosures, asset prices may not fully reflect climate-related risks. Consequently,
market participants may inadvertently accumulate large exposures to such risks, leaving them
vulnerable to considerable unexpected and potentially sudden losses.
977
In the face of such losses, financial intermediaries may be forced to sell off assets at firesale prices to generate enough cash to pay claims or to otherwise meet the time-sensitive cash
demands of creditors and counterparties. This fire-sale dynamic could push down asset prices as
well as the value of firms holding similar assets due to mark-to-market losses, potentially
increasing risk premia and correlations across asset classes.978 Stress from large, complex, and
interconnected financial institutions, or correlated stress across smaller market participants, could
be transmitted and propagate through the financial system,

979 Physical risks can have immediate and direct effects on asset values, but they also present long-term indirect
risks. By damaging assets that serve as collateral for loans or that underpin other investments, reducing property
values, increasing insurance premiums or decreasing insurance coverage, diminishing agricultural capacity, and
causing labor forces to migrate, the physical consequences of climate change could have profound and long
term effects on financial markets more generally. See Jonathan Woetzel et al., Climate Risk and Response:

of financial services.980 A more efficient allocation of capital brought about the disclosure
required by the proposed rules could reduce the probability and magnitude of disorderly price
corrections or dislocations, thereby strengthening financial system resilience. 981
2. Competition
The provisions included in the proposed rules are expected to increase comparability
among registrants by demanding climate-related information in a consistent manner and with
machine-readable data language (Inline XBRL). More standardized climate reporting could
improve competition among registrants as it could reduce their costs for both producing such
information due to enhanced efficiencies of scale across the economy and the cost for acquiring
and processing said information by investors.
As discussed in Section IV.C.2, positive externalities from standard reporting practices
can provide market-wide cost savings to registrants in the long-term, to the extent that they
reduce duplicative effort in registrants’ production and acquisition of information (e.g. certain
data or third-party services related to preparing the required disclosures, including the reporting
of emissions data, may become cheaper in the long run as the heightened demand spur
competition, innovation, and other economies of scale). These cost savings could be particularly
980 A recent report by an advisory committee to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) concluded
that “climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain
the American economy.” See Report of the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, Market Risk Advisory
Committee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial
System (2020). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has identified the effects of climate
change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks and the financial
system. See, e.g., Semiannual Risk Perspective, 2-4 (Fall 2021), available at
https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/semiannual-risk-perspective/files/pubsemiannual-risk-perspective-fall-2021.pdf.

helpful for smaller registrants, or those that are capital constrained, which otherwise may not be
able to provide the same amount, or level of detail, of climate-related disclosures as registrants
with greater resources.
More standardized reporting should also reduce investors’ costs for acquiring and
processing climate-related information by facilitating investors’ analysis of a registrant’s
disclosure and assessing its climate-related risks against those of its competitors. The placement
of climate-related information in SEC filings with machine-readable data language (Inline
XBRL), rather than external reports or company websites, should also make it easier for
investors to find and compare this information.
Overall, we expect that by standardizing reporting practices, the proposed rules would
level the playing field among firms, making it easier for investors to assess the climate-related
risks of a registrant against those of its competitors. The effects of peer benchmarking can
contribute to increased competition for companies in search for capital both across and within
industries, whereby firms can be more easily assessed and compared by investors against
alternative options.
Failure to implement the proposed rules could lead to an informational gap between U.S.
registrants and companies operating in foreign jurisdictions which require climate-related
disclosures. For example, such a gap may increase investors’ uncertainty when assessing
climate-related risks of U.S. registrants vis-à-vis foreign competitors and place U.S. registrants at
a competitive disadvantage, with the potential to deter investments and hence increase U.S.
registrants’ cost of capital. This informational gap may also pose obstacles to U.S. companies
transacting with counterparts and businesses in their supply-chain operating in foreign
jurisdictions which require Scope 3 emission disclosures. According to Morningstar, more than
399
35% of S&P 500 firms’ total revenues came from foreign markets, while this percentage is
around 20% for the revenues of Russell 2000 firms.
982 Lack of standardized disclosures around
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission by U.S. companies, which may in part be due to the
aforementioned impediments to voluntary disclosure,983 may obstruct foreign counterparts from
accurately assessing their Scope 3 GHG emissions, thus putting U.S. registrants at a competitive
disadvantage over other foreign companies which may be publicly disclosing such information.
3. Capital formation
More consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures could lead to capital-market
benefits in the form of improved liquidity, lower costs of capital, and higher asset prices (or firm
valuations).984 Enhanced disclosures (e.g., accurate GHG emissions disclosures) can reduce the
time necessary for processing registrant’s relevant information, thus increasing efficiency for
registrants in their access to capital and allowing the market to more efficiently assess its cost.
These benefits would stem from reductions in information asymmetries brought about by the
required disclosure of climate-related information. More comparable, consistent, and reliable
climate-related disclosures could reduce information asymmetries, both among investors and
between firms and their investors.

 See Section IV.B.2.
984 See D.W. Diamond and R.E. Verrecchia, Disclosure, Liquidity, and the Cost of Capital, 46 J. Fin.1325 (1991)
(this study finds that revealing public information to reduce information asymmetry can reduce a firm’s cost of
capital through increased liquidity); See also C. Leuz and R.E. Verrecchia, The Economic Consequences of
Increased Disclosure, 38 J. Acct. Res. 91 (2000). Several studies provide both theoretical and empirical
evidence of the link between information asymmetry and cost of capital. See, e.g., T.E. Copeland and D. Galai,
Information Effects on the Bid‐Ask Spread, 38 J. FIN. 1457 (1983) (proposing a theory of information effects on
the bid-ask spread); D. Easley and M. O'Hara, Information and the Cost of Capital, 59 J. FIN. 1553 (2004) (This
study shows that differences in the composition of information between public and private information affect
the cost of capital, with investors demanding a higher return to hold stocks with greater private information.).
400
In the first case, less information asymmetry among investors could mitigate adverse
selection problems by reducing the informational advantage of informed traders.985 This is likely
to improve stock liquidity (i.e., narrower bid-ask spreads), which could attract more investors
and reduce the cost of capital. In the second case, less information asymmetry between firms
and their investors could allow investors to better estimate future cash flows, which could reduce
investors’ uncertainty, as well as the risk premium they demand, thus lowering the costs of
capital.986
Recent studies provide some supporting empirical evidence of these effects within the
context of ESG- or climate-related disclosure. These studies have found that, when firms
voluntarily provide material sustainability disclosures, they also experience improvements in
liquidity (e.g. smaller bid-ask spreads).987 In addition, firms that choose to disclose emissions
have lower costs of equity and loan spreads.988 While firms’ decisions about whether and when
to disclose emissions data may be correlated with other factors as well asset prices/financing
costs, this would be consistent with such disclosures reducing the costs of capital for firms (to
the extent that some of these effects are driven by the disclosures themselves).

E. Other Economic Effects
The proposed rules may have some effects on firm behavior. Prior empirical evidence
supports the notion that, in response to mandatory ESG-related disclosure rules, firms tend to
report actions that appear more “favorable” with respect to the corresponding disclosures. These
decisions would be made by a firm’s management with the goal of maximizing firm value in
response to the new disclosure mandate. To the extent that these actions reduce firms’ exposures
to physical and transition risks, this could lower the return that investors require for investing in
these firms, hence facilitating capital formation. This could reduce volatility of stock returns due
to enhanced resiliency against such risks.
Empirical evidence shows that mandatory reporting of GHG emissions results in reduced
aggregate reported emissions among affected firms.989 Academic research shows that mandatory
ESG-related disclosure often contributes, not only to increased monitoring by investors or other
stakeholders, but also to enhanced peer benchmarking by firms as they can more easily compare
themselves with their competitors.990 These changes may reflect market responses by companies
and investors to the newly disclosed information. Accordingly, registrants may change their
behavior in response to the proposed disclosure requirements by reducing exposures to certain
physical or transition risks. However, this could also come with the potential cost of lower
productivity, profitability, or market share in the short-term.
989 See B. Downar, J. Ernstberger, S. Reichelstein, S. Schwenen, and A. Zaklan, The Impact of Carbon Disclosure
Mandates on Emissions and Financial Operating Performance, REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES 1-39 (2021);

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3448904; See supra note 849 (Jouvenout and Kruger,
2021).
990 See supra note 840.
402
Registrants might respond to the proposed disclosures by devoting more resources to
climate-related governance and risk management in an effort to address indirect effects on their
business arising from the disclosures. For example, the proposed rules require disclosure of
members of the board or management that have prior climate expertise. Some registrants may
respond by giving more weight to climate expertise when searching for directors, which may
lead them to deviate from the board composition that would have been in place absent the
proposed rules. Similarly, the proposed rules would require disclosure on how climate-related
risks can impact registrants’ consolidated financial statements, among others. Registrants may
respond by taking measures to minimize negative impacts in order to put forth more favorable
metrics. For example, registrants may move assets or operations away from geographic areas
with higher physical risk exposures or may seek to decrease GHG emissions.
The provision on GHG Emissions would also require scope 1, 2, and 3 (if material or the
registrant has a set a target or goal for scope 3) emission disclosures. These emission disclosures
may induce firms to use peer benchmarking to decide whether to investigate and reevaluate their
energy usage991 or otherwise reduce emissions based on anticipated market reactions to the
disclosed information. This process may provide certain registrants with incentives to search for
alternative energy sources or find different suppliers, which could increase costs. Conversely, it
could also prompt certain firms to reduce nonessential activities and improve operational
efficiency, which could lead to lower operating costs.
The provision requiring assurance of GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures would
only apply to accelerated filers. Non-accelerated filers would, instead, be required only to state
991 See supra note 840.
403
whether any of their GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third-party assurance, and if so,
at what level. By asking all registrants, including non-accelerated filers, to disclose climaterelated information within SEC filings, however, the proposed rules may motivate more nonaccelerated filers to voluntarily seek assurance over these types of disclosures, than if the same
information had been disclosed on companies’ websites or sustainability reports. Certain nonaccelerated filers may also voluntarily decide to attain assurance over their GHG emission
disclosures in order to enhance their reliability and prevent these disclosures from being
perceived by investors as less reliable compared to those provided by accelerated filers.
As another example, the proposed rules would require the disclosure of the location (via
ZIP code) of firm assets or operations, which could allow investors to assess firms’ exposures to
physical risk at a more granular level. This may allow investors to more easily diversify these
geographic-driven risks or expose themselves to such risks, if they choose to, more deliberately.
This may cause some firms to relocate assets or operations to geographical areas less exposed to
physical risks and/or give preferences to such areas for future business activity. It may also cause
some firms with higher geographic exposures to physical risks to alter overall operational risk
and strategies.
The proposed rules might also affect the networks firms choose to operate in. For
example, a firm may choose to change some suppliers or disengage with certain clients due to
the effect that they may have on the firm’s Scope 3 emissions. This may be particularly relevant
for certain financial institutions that are impacted by their portfolio firms’ emissions or climaterelated risks. These financial institutions may be less willing to extend credit to firms for which it
is difficult to measure climate risk exposure information, potentially increasing the cost of capital
for these firms.
404
However, there are certain factors that may mitigate this effect. First, the proposed rules
establish a phase-in period, which is intended to give financial institutions and their prospective
borrowers sufficient time to prepare the required disclosures. Second, analytical tools, data, and
related methodologies (such as those related to measuring/reporting GHG emissions) are
developing rapidly and increasing in availability. Finally, frameworks like the PCAF to measure
financed emissions would allow financial institutions to compute proxies for the emissions of
their clients in a systematic and comparable manner even in the absence of actual emissions data.
The proposed rules could also cause some firms to pursue avoidance strategies. The
provision on Targets and Goals would require a registrant to disclose whether it has set any
climate-related targets or goals and the specific plans in place to achieve those objectives and
metrics to monitor progress. This may disincentivize certain firms from making such
commitments and providing the associated disclosures in SEC filings. Risk of litigation or
enforcement actions, could result in registrants being more cautious in their decision to set
climate-related targets. Other firms, however, may find the existence of mandatory disclosures
around climate-related targets and goals to be beneficial for signaling credible value-enhancing
commitments to investors. More credible and standardized disclosures on climate-related targets
and goals could make registrants’ communication more effective and facilitate investors’
understanding of related progress, hence providing additional incentives for making such
commitments.
More generally, if compliance costs with the proposed rules are high, this could influence
the marginal firm’s decision to exit public markets or refrain from going public in the first place
in order to circumvent the disclosure requirements. Firms may choose this strategy if they
believe the potential compliance costs from the proposed rules outweigh the benefits of being
405
registered public company. Uptake of this avoidance strategy may widen the transparency gap
between public and private firms, negatively affecting capital markets’ information efficiency,
and potentially reduce the size of the stock market. However, it is unlikely that a significant
number of firms would pursue this avoidance strategy given that it would come with significant
disadvantages, such as higher costs of capital, limited access to capital markets, and limits to
their growth potential. Moreover, recent trends in private markets indicate that industry’s top
leaders are working toward a standard set of metrics for tracking their portfolio companies’ ESG
progress. The pressure on private companies to disclose information on climate-related risks is
rapidly escalating within the private industry, hence diminishing the potential incentive for
registrants to go private in order to avoid climate-related disclosure requirements. For example,
since its launch in September 2021, the ESG Data Convergence Project, which seeks to
standardize ESG metrics and provide a mechanism for comparative reporting for the private
market industry, has announced a milestone commitment of over 100 leading general partners
and limited partners to its partnership representing $8.7 trillion USD in AUM and over 1,400
underlying portfolio companies across the globe. The initial data for the project includes, among
others, greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy metrics.992
F. Reasonable Alternatives
1. Requirements limited to only certain classes of filers
One alternative would be to require the proposed disclosures only from larger registrants,
such as large accelerated filers or non-SRCs. While the proposed rules already provide certain
992 See Carlyle, Private Equity Industry’s First-Ever ESG Data Convergence Project Announces Milestone
Commitment of Over 100 LPs and GPs (Jan. 28, 2022), available at https://www.carlyle.com/mediaroom/news-release-archive/private-equity-industrys-first-ever-esg-data-convergence-project-announces-over100-lps-gps.
406
exemptions for SRCs (e.g., Scope 3 emissions disclosures and assurance requirements), this
alternative would exempt smaller registrants from the entirety of the proposed rules. The main
benefit of this alternative is that it would avoid imposing potentially significant compliance costs
on smaller registrants, which are more likely to be resource-constrained. However, considering
that SRCs make up approximately 50% of registrants (and registrants that are not large
accelerated filers make up approximately 70%), this alternative would also considerably
undermine one of the primary objectives of the proposed rules, which is to achieve consistent,
comparable, and reliable disclosures of climate-related information. Furthermore, climate-related
risks are impacting or are expected to impact every sector of the economy,993 further highlighting
the need for enhanced disclosures from all registrants. In an effort to arrive at an appropriate
balance between these costs and benefits, the proposed rules exempt SRCs from some, but not
all, disclosure requirements.
2. Require scenario analysis
Another alternative would be to require registrants to conduct scenario analysis and
include the related information in their disclosures. Consistent, comparable, and reliable
disclosures of scenario analysis could inform investors with respect to the resilience of
registrants’ business strategies and operations across a range of plausible future climate
scenarios. Disclosure of scenario analysis could deliver informational benefits to investors
beyond that which would be provided under the proposed rules. It could help investors assess
993 SASB research shows climate risk is nearly ubiquitous but highly differentiated across 77 industries. See SASB
Publishes Updated Climate Risk Technical Bulletin (Apr. 13, 2021), available at
https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/13/2208855/0/en/SASB-Publishes-Updated-ClimateRisk-Technical-Bulletin.html.
407
issues that have high uncertainty by evaluating the impact on and the resiliency of the registrant
under multiple plausible future scenarios, such as a temperature increase of 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C
above pre-industrial levels. It could also allow investors to proactively manage risk as they
would be better able to assess the range of potential threats and opportunities, evaluate different
management actions, and adapt accordingly. Furthermore, since some climate-related risks may
only manifest over longer horizons, scenario analysis could assist investors in determining
whether registrants have incorporated such risks into their long-term strategy. Investors could
subsequently incorporate this information into asset prices, thereby more accurately pricing
climate-related risks and contributing to market efficiency.
Both scenario analysis methodologies and climate science, however, continue to advance
and develop, which may pose significant challenges for some registrants. Specifically, the
required data may be unavailable or costly to obtain. Furthermore, some registrants may lack the
necessary expertise, requiring them to hire external consultants to conduct the analysis. These
challenges may pose undue burdens with respect to difficulty and/or costs to some registrants,
such as smaller companies and those that otherwise have no prior experience in scenario
analysis. For these reasons, the Commission is not proposing to mandate scenario analysis and
related disclosure at this time.
3. Require specific external protocol for GHG emissions disclosure
Another alternative would be to require registrants to follow an external protocol (e.g.,
GHG protocol) for reporting emissions. Requiring a specific protocol may potentially benefit
investors by providing a more consistent and comparable framework in reporting emissions, thus
facilitating investors’ information processing. However, there also may be certain drawbacks.
408
First, the organizational boundaries adopted by external protocols may create
inconsistencies with the way companies would report information about their GHG emissions
vis-à-vis the rest of their financial statements. The GHG Protocol, for example, requires that a
company base its organizational boundaries on either an equity share approach or a control
approach, which may differ from the way registrants set their scope for the purpose of reporting
information in their financial statements. The proposed rules would require a registrant to set the
organizational boundaries for its GHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities,
operations, assets, and other holdings as those included in its consolidated financial statements.
Requiring a consistent scope of consolidation and reporting between financial data and GHG
emissions data should help avoid potential investor confusion about the reporting scope used in
determining a registrant’s GHG emissions and the reporting scope used for the financial
statement metrics.
Furthermore, requiring companies to follow a specific external protocol might limit
flexibility for registrants and thus reduce their ability to report emissions in a manner that is
tailored to their specific circumstances. For example, registrants following an existing but
different protocol, which nevertheless provides relevant emissions information, would be
required to switch protocols, incurring additional cost.
Requiring compliance with a specific protocol could also reduce the scope for innovation
in driving the most appropriate forms of disclosure within these overarching guidelines (e.g., the
methodologies pertaining to the measurement of GHG emissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions,
are still evolving). Additionally, requiring compliance with a specific external protocol as of the
date of the adoption of any final rules may become problematic in the future to the extent that the
external protocol’s methodologies shift or evolve such that the version incorporated by reference
409
into the final rules becomes outdated or inconsistent with improving methodologies. While we
expect that many registrants will choose to follow many of the standards and guidance provided
by the GHG Protocol when calculating their GHG emissions, not requiring compliance with the
GHG Protocol would provide some flexibility to the Commission’s climate-related disclosure
regime and enable registrants to follow new and potentially less costly methodologies as they
emerge.
4. Permit GHG emissions disclosures to be “furnished” instead of “filed”
Another alternative would be to permit Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions disclosures to be
considered “furnished” instead of “filed,” which may limit the incremental risk of being held
liable under Section 18 of the Exchange Act for these disclosures. This may also benefit some
registrants as their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures would not be automatically incorporated
into Securities Act registration statements and thereby not be subject to Section 11 liability. We
note that this could have a lower incremental impact on Scope 3 emissions disclosures since
Scope 3 emissions disclosures are covered under a proposed safe harbor provision and hence
already afforded other liability protections. However, reduced liability in general may lead to the
applicable disclosures being perceived as less reliable by investors, which could have adverse
effects on registrants’ stock liquidity or costs of capital. For these reasons, the Commission is not
proposing to permit emissions disclosures to be furnished at this time.
5. Do not require Scope 3 emissions for registrants with a target or goal related
to Scope 3
Another alternative would be to not require Scope 3 emissions disclosures if such
emissions are part of a target or goal from any registrant. This would allow certain registrants to
avoid the potentially significant costs and difficulties associated with measuring and reporting
410
Scope 3 emissions. This could potentially deprive investors of important information necessary
to assess registrants’ exposures to certain risks associated with trying to achieve targets or
transition plans. Scope 3 emissions can provide investors with a more complete picture of how
targets or transition plans might impact risks (e.g., future regulations restricting emissions or
changes in market conditions that disfavor high emissions products or services) of the registrant
through the value chain. This can be particularly important considering that Scope 3 emissions
can make up the vast majority of total emissions for many registrants.994 Furthermore, some
firms can give the appearance of low (direct) emissions by shifting high-emission activities
elsewhere in their value chain.995 Mandatory disclosure of Scope 3 emissions for registrants with
a target or goal related to Scope 3 emissions can help prevent such misrepresentation.
6. Exempt EGCs from Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements
Another alternative would be to retain the exemption for SRCs, as currently proposed,
but also extend it to EGCs. EGCs may similarly face resource constraints related to company
size or age, hence this alternative would allow EGCs to avoid the costs of Scope 3 emissions
measurement and reporting. Given that the designations of SRC and EGC are not mutually
exclusive, however, EGCs that are also SRCs would be covered under the exemption as currently
proposed. Conversely, EGCs that are not SRCs are relatively less resource-constrained since
they, by definition, have greater revenues and/or public float, and therefore may be better
positioned to provide Scope 3 emissions disclosures.
994 See supra, note 881.
995 See supra, note 886.
411
7. Eliminate exemption for SRCs from Scope 3 reporting
Another alternative would be to eliminate the exemption for SRCs. Because SRCs make
up approximately half of domestic filers in terms of numbers (though considerably less in terms
of market cap), this alternative could address data gaps with respect to Scope 3 emissions, with
the potential to benefit all investors. As discussed in Section II.G.3, however, this alternative
may pose fixed costs (e.g. data gathering and verification), that would fall disproportionately on
SRCs. Also, because SRCs are a small fraction of the market, the overall benefit to investors
would be limited.
8. Remove safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosures
The proposed rules provide a safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosures. An
alternative would be to remove this safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions disclosures. This
alternative would strengthen accountability for Scope 3 emissions disclosures. It also would
significantly increase registrants’ exposure to litigation over the accuracy of such disclosures.
While rigorous liability in many contexts can provide incentives that promote reliable
disclosures, an accommodation may be warranted for Scope 3 emissions due to the challenges
associated with their measurement and disclosure.996
9. Require large accelerated filers and accelerated filers to provide a
management assessment and to obtain an attestation report covering the
effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures.
The proposed rules would require assurance over Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure
from large accelerated filers and accelerated filers. In addition to such assurance, we could
996
 See Section II.G.3
412
require these filers to also obtain either a separate assessment by management and disclosure on
the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures or an attestation report specifically
covering the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures, or both. Specifically,
management could be required to include a statement in the annual report on their responsibility
for the design and evaluation of controls over GHG emission disclosures, as well as to disclose
their conclusion regarding the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures, in
addition to the existing DCP evaluation and disclosure. In addition, we could require a GHG
emissions attestation provider to obtain reasonable assurance on whether material weaknesses
exist regarding management’s assessment of the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions
disclosures as of the measurement date. The GHG emissions attestation provider could also be
required to issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions
disclosures.
997
By requiring GHG emissions attestation providers to assess not just the disclosures, but
also the controls over GHG emissions disclosures (i.e., the underlying mechanisms, rules, and
procedures associated with generating such disclosures), this alternative could further strengthen
the integrity of the disclosed information. In the context of emissions, GHG emissions
attestation providers may evaluate and test the effectiveness of registrants’ controls related to the
collection, calculation, estimation, and validation of GHG emissions data and disclosure. These
processes could strengthen disclosure credibility as they reduce the likelihood of errors or fraud
997 See AICPA, AU-C 940, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated With an
Audit of Financial Statements (2021), available at
https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c00940.pdf.
413
and their ensuing misstatements.998 Investors would benefit from any resulting improvement in
disclosure reliability for reasons discussed in prior sections: it would allow investors to make
better-informed investment decisions, allow applicable information to be better incorporated into
asset prices, and contribute to a more efficient allocation of capital. Registrants may also benefit
via reduced costs of capital and increased stock liquidity.
However, this alternative would also impose additional assurance costs.999 Given that
GHG emissions measurement and disclosure are developing areas, it is unclear what exact
controls are or would be in effect, making it difficult to anticipate precisely what such attestation
would entail. These uncertainties pose further difficulties in obtaining informative cost estimates
and, accordingly, accurate assessments of how burdensome such a requirement would be to
registrants. This leaves the possibility that the costs could outweigh the incremental benefits
given that the proposed rules already require assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures
for applicable registrants. For these reasons, the Commission is not proposing at this time to
require an attestation report on the effectiveness of controls over GHG emissions disclosures.
998 Potentially consistent with this, though in a different setting, academic evidence surrounding Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) finds lower accruals and discretionary accruals for small firms whose 2002 float
(prior to when firms could have known and therefore tried to alter their float to avoid the regulation) made them
likely to be just above the requirements for compliance, relative to those just below. Iliev, Peter (2010). The
effect of SOX Section 404: Cost, earnings quality and stock prices. Journal of Finance, 65, 1163-1196.
999 Also potentially consistent with this, prior academic studies of Section 404 of SOX find significantly higher
auditing fees, negative stock returns, and reduced innovation, though no clear evidence of a decline in
investment, for marginally complying small firms near the float requirement threshold. See Iliev, Peter (2010).

Sarbanes-Oxley Act discouraged corporate investment? New evidence from a natural experiment. Management
Science 65(7): 3423-3446.
414
10. Require reasonable assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures from
all registrants.
Another alternative would be to require reasonable assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions
disclosures from all registrants. As described above, requiring assurance can benefit investors in
several ways, including enhanced reliability of disclosures, which would allow investors to make
better-informed investment decisions
However, because costs increase with the level of assurance, requiring reasonable
assurance may be particularly burdensome for affected registrants (i.e., smaller firms) as they
would be more likely to incur proportionately higher compliance costs due to the fixed cost
components of such compliance, regardless of whether or not there is a transition period before
this requirement takes effect. While the benefits of assurance could be approximately
proportional to registrant’s market value, the costs are not. In an effort to arrive at an appropriate
balance between these factors, the proposed rules would require reasonable assurance (after a
specified transition period) only from large accelerated filers and accelerated filers because the
benefits to investors are more likely to justify the costs for these firms.
11. Require limited, not reasonable, assurance for large accelerated filers and/or
accelerated filers and/or other filers.
Obtaining reasonable assurance generally costs more than obtaining limited assurance.
Current market practice appears to favor obtaining limited assurance over sustainability reports,
if assurance is obtained at all. Experimental evidence suggests assurance (relative to none) may
increase perceived reliability of sustainability reports, but is yet to provide evidence that
reasonable assurance increases perceived reliability of sustainability reports relative to limited
415
assurance.1000 We acknowledge, however, that experimental findings from lab settings may not
necessarily reflect the behavior or preferences of experienced investors in actual financial
markets. Furthermore, other research often exhibits a selection bias (i.e., companies that
voluntarily decide to obtain a higher-than-required level of assurance are systematically different
across several dimensions), making it difficult to determine the causal effect of the different
levels of assurance.
1001
One possibility to mitigate the additional costs of reasonable assurance would be to
maintain the requirement that large accelerated filers obtain reasonable assurance, but allow
accelerated filers to obtain limited assurance without any scaling up to a reasonable assurance.
Another possibility would be to require limited assurance, but expand the assurance requirement
to a broader scope of registrants including non-accelerated filers and smaller reporting
companies. However, these possibilities have the disadvantage of lack of consistency, which
could lead to confusion among investors.
12. In lieu of requiring assurance, require disclosure about any assurance
obtained over GHG emissions disclosures
Another alternative would be to require all registrants to disclose what type of assurance
they are receiving, if any, in lieu of requiring assurance. This would potentially allow affected

416
registrants to avoid the costs of obtaining limited assurance and/or reasonable assurance.1002
Additionally, registrants would have the flexibility to choose any level of assurance (i.e., none,
limited, or reasonable assurance) but still be required to disclose their choice for transparency.
This alternative, however, may reduce the reliability and comparability of these disclosures
relative to the standardized assurance requirements within the proposed rules. In addition, as it
does not set any minimum requirements for the assurance, this alternative would not address the
fragmentation and selective disclosure issues that characterize the current, voluntary reporting
regime.
13. Permit host country disclosure frameworks
Another alternative would be to permit alternative compliance using host country
disclosure frameworks that the Commission deems suitable. Such an alternative would be
beneficial for registrants that already comply with another country’s disclosure requirements
since they could avoid incurring additional costs to comply with the Commission’s rules. This
flexibility, however, may fail to address or may even exacerbate growing concerns from
investors that climate-related disclosures lack comparability and consistency. While it might be
individually optimal for a given firm to use their existing host country disclosure frameworks,
the potential lack of consistency and comparability of the disclosure between these firms and
other registrant might impose costs on investors. Investors might not able to compare across
firms using different disclosure presentations, or may have to incur additional costs in order to do
so.
1002
 See Section IV.C.2.(3) for cost estimates of assurance over emissions disclosures.

14. Alternative tagging requirements
With respect to Inline XBRL tagging, one alternative is to change the scope of
disclosures required to be tagged. We could, for example, remove the tagging requirements for
climate-related disclosures for all or a subset of registrants (such as smaller reporting
companies). As another example, we could require only a subset of proposed climate-related
disclosures, such as the quantitative climate-related metrics, to be tagged in Inline XBRL.
Narrowing the scope of climate-related disclosures to be tagged could provide some incremental
cost savings for registrants compared to the proposal, because incrementally less time would be
required to select and review the particular tags to apply to the climate-related disclosures.
We expect this incremental cost savings to be low because all affected registrants are or
in the near future will be required to tag certain of their disclosures (including both quantitative
and qualitative disclosures) in Inline XBRL.1003
 Moreover, narrowing the scope of tagging
requirements would diminish the extent of informational benefits that would accrue to investors
by reducing the volume of climate-related information that would become less costly to process
and easier to compare across time and registrants. For example, an alternative whereby only
quantitative climate-related disclosures would be tagged would inhibit investors from efficiently
extracting/searching climate-related disclosures about registrants’ governance; strategy, business
model, and outlook; risk management; and targets and goals, thus creating the need to manually
1003 Inline XBRL requirements for business development companies will take effect beginning Aug. 1, 2022 (for
seasoned issuers) and Feb. 1, 2023 (for all other issuers). If the proposed Inline XBRL requirements are
adopted in the interim, they will not apply to business development companies prior to the aforementioned
effectiveness dates. See supra note 706.
418
run searches for these disclosures through entire documents.1004 Such an alternative would also
inhibit the automatic comparison/redlining of these disclosures against prior periods, and the
performance of targeted artificial intelligence or machine learning assessments (tonality,
sentiment, risk words, etc.) of specific narrative climate-related disclosures outside the financial
statements rather than the entire unstructured document.
G. Request for Comment
We request comment on all aspects of our economic analysis, including the potential
costs and benefits of the proposed rules and alternatives thereto, and whether the proposed rules,
if adopted, would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation or have an impact on
investor protection. In addition, we also seek comment on alternative approaches to the
proposed rules and the associated costs and benefits of these approaches. Commenters are
requested to provide empirical data, estimation methodologies, and other factual support for their
views, in particular, on costs and benefits estimates. Specifically, we seek comment with respect
to the following questions:
• Are there any costs and benefits to any entity that are not identified or misidentified in the
above analysis?
• Are there any effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that are not
identified or misidentified in the above analysis?
• Are there any other alternative approaches to improving climate-related disclosure that
we should consider? If so, what are they and what would be the associated costs or
1004 To illustrate, using a search string such as “climate change” or “greenhouse gas” to search through the text
of all filings from a particular filer population so as to determine the trends in narrative climate-related
disclosure among that population over time, could return many narrative disclosures outside of the climaterelated disclosures. Examples of this would be a description of pending environmental litigation, existing
government regulations and agency names, and broader regulatory risk factors.
419
benefits of these alternative approaches? For example, what would be the costs and
benefits of implementing a new, comprehensive system, for reporting and transferring
GHG emissions across corporate supply and distribution chains, as described by Kaplan
and Ramanna (2021)?1005
• Are there any sources of data that could provide a more precise estimation of the
potential compliance costs that registrants may incur if the proposed rules are adopted?
• Have we accurately estimated the costs of disclosing Scope 1 and 2 emissions? If not,
please provide alternative estimates of these costs.
• Have we accurately estimated the costs of disclosing Scope 3? If not, please provide
alternative estimates of these costs.
• Are there any additional sources of information to estimate the costs of complying with
the Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions disclosure requirements and the costs of obtaining
limited and reasonable assurance for these disclosures?
• Would any data sources allow these compliance cost estimates to be apportioned to
separate provisions of the proposed rules? Furthermore, how would these cost estimates
vary across time horizons? For example, the first year of implementation may come with
higher start-up costs while subsequent years may come with lower costs.
• Have we accurately characterized the cost of limited assurance and reasonable assurance
over Scopes 1 and 2 emissions? If not, please provide an estimate of these costs.
Similarly, is there data that can show how the costs of limited assurance and reasonable
assurance differ for large accelerated, accelerated and non-accelerated filers?
1005 See R. Kaplan and K. Ramanna, How to Fix ESG Reporting (2021), available at
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3900146.
420
• How are the costs of obtaining limited assurance and reasonable assurance likely to
change over time (e.g., over the five years following adoption or compliance with a
specified level of assurance)? What would be the costs and benefits of providing a longer
transition period for obtaining assurance over Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures?
V. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A. Summary of the Collections of Information
Certain provisions of our rules and forms that would be affected by the proposed
amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).1006 The Commission is submitting the proposal to
the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA.1007 The
hours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms and reports constitute reporting
and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. An agency may not conduct or
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information requirement
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Compliance with the information
collections is mandatory. Responses to the information collections are not kept confidential and
there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed. The titles for the affected
collections of information are:
• Form S-1 (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);
• Form F-1 (OMB Control No. 3235-0258);
• Form S-4 (OMB Control No. 3235-0324);
• Form F-4 (OMB Control No. 3235-0325);
1006
 See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
1007 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.
421
• Form S-11 (OMB Control No. 3235-0067);
• Form 10 (OMB Control No. 3235-0064);
• Form 10-K (OMB Control No. 3235-0063);
• Form 10-Q (OMB Control No. 3235-0070);
• Form 20-F (OMB Control No. 3235-0288); and
• Form 6-K (OMB Control No. 3235-0116).
1008
The proposed amendments would require U.S. registrants filing Securities Act
registration statements on Forms S-1, S-4, and S-11 to include the climate-related disclosures
required under proposed subpart 1500 of Regulation S-K and proposed Article 14 of Regulation
S-X. The proposed amendments would also require foreign private issuers to include the
proposed climate-related disclosures when filing Securities Act registration statements on Forms
F-1 and F-4. The proposed amendments would further require U.S. registrants and foreign
private issuers to include the proposed climate-related disclosures in their Exchange Act annual
reports filed, respectively, on Forms 10-K and 20-F and in Exchange Act registration statements
filed, respectively, on Forms 10 and 20-F. Registrants would be required to include the climaterelated information required under proposed subpart 1500 in a part of the registration statement
or annual report that is separately captioned as Climate-Related Disclosure. Registrants would
be required to include the climate information required under Article 14 in a note to the financial
statements, which would be subject to audit. Further, as described below, accelerated filers and
1008 The proposed amendments would also indirectly affect Forms S-3 and F-3. Registrants filing Forms S-3 and F3 are able to incorporate by reference their annual reports filed on Forms 10-K or 20-F. Because the proposed
amendments would affect Forms 10-K and 20-F, and are not expected to affect Forms S-3 and F-3 except when
Forms 10-K and 20-F are incorporated by reference into those Securities Act forms, we are not separately
accounting for the PRA burden related to Forms S-3 and F-3.
422
large accelerated filers would be required to include an attestation report covering their Scopes 1
and 2 emissions disclosure, subject to phase-ins. In addition, U.S. registrants and foreign private
issuers would be required to report material changes to the climate information disclosed in their
Exchange Act reports on, respectively, Forms 10-Q and 6-K. A description of the proposed
amendments, including the need for the climate information and its proposed use, as well as a
description of the likely respondents, can be found in Section II above, and a discussion of the
economic effects of the proposed amendments can be found in Section IV above.
B. Summary of the Proposed Amendments’ Effects on the Collections of
Information
Our estimates of the paperwork burden associated with the proposed amendments are
based primarily on climate-related reporting cost estimates from six sources: a comment letter
from the Society for Corporate Governance (“Society”) that provided some hour and cost
estimates for climate reporting by large-cap companies;1009 a report by the Climate Risk
Disclosure Lab at Duke University School of Law’s Global Financial Markets Center that
presents survey results of climate-related disclosure costs for three unnamed companies;1010 an
impact assessment conducted by the United Kingdom’s Department for Business, Energy, and
Industrial Strategy for a rule that, similar to the Commission’s proposed rules, would require

Climate-Related Disclosure (Dec. 2021), available at https://climatedisclosurelab.duke.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2021/12/The-Cost-of-Climate-Disclosure.pdf.
423
TCFD-aligned disclosures from all listed firms;1011 two cost estimates from a data analytics
firm‒one that covered primarily risk assessment and analysis pursuant to the TCFD framework,
and the other for calculating GHG emissions;1012 and cost estimates for GHG emissions
measurement and reporting from two climate management firms.1013

In response to Acting Chair Lee’s request for public input about climate disclosures,1014
Society submitted the results of a survey it had conducted on a small number of public large-cap
companies about the costs of their current climate reporting. According to this commenter, two
companies estimated that the number of employee hours spent on climate reporting ranged from
7,500 to 10,000 annually, while a third company estimated the number of annual employee hours
spent on climate reporting to be 2,940 hours.1015
 The average annual employee hours spent on
climate reporting for these large-cap companies was 6,813 hours.1016

The Climate Risk Disclosure Lab’s report presents the results of its survey of one
European large-cap financial institution, one US large-cap industrial manufacturing company,
1011 See UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, Final Stage Impact Assessment (Oct. 1,

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972423/impac
t-assessment.pdf . The scope of the impact assessment included companies listed on the London Stock
Exchange with over 500 employees, UK registered companies admitted to AIM with over 500 employees, and
certain other companies.
1012 See memorandum, dated Feb. 4, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global. This and
the other staff memoranda referenced below are available at https://www-draft.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-

1013 See memorandum, dated Nov. 30, 2021, concerning staff meeting with representatives of Persefoni; and
memorandum, dated Jan. 14, 2022, concerning staff meeting with representatives of South Pole.
1014 See supra Section I.B.
1015 See letter from Society for Corporate Governance. This commenter also stated that fees for external climate
advisory services ranged from $50,000 to $1.35 million annually.
1016 7,500 hrs.+ 10,000 hrs. +2,940 hrs. = 20,440 hrs.; 20,440/3 = 6,813 hrs.

and one US mid-cap waste management company about their climate-related disclosure costs.1017

The European financial institution reported annual climate-related disclosure costs ranging from
$250,000 to $500,000, which averages to $375,000 annually.1018
 For PRA purposes, we have
converted this dollar cost average to 6,818 burden hours using a metric of $55/hour.1019
 The US
industrial manufacturing company disclosed annual climate-related disclosure costs for its
employees and one full-time consultant ranging from $200,000 to $350,000, which averages to
$275,000 annually. We have similarly converted this dollar cost average to 5,000 burden
hours.1020
 The US waste management company reported that its employees spent 82 hours
annually to produce its climate-related disclosures. The average annual internal burden hours
spent on climate reporting for these three companies comes to 3,967 hours.1021
The UK Impact Assessment estimated on an ongoing, annual basis the number of hours
and costs that it would take in-house personnel1022 to gather data and prepare and provide
disclosure for each of the following TCFD-aligned topics: governance, strategy, risk
management, and metrics and targets.1023
 The impact assessment also estimated on an annual,
ongoing basis the number of hours and costs that it would take a parent company’s personnel to
1017 See supra Section IV.C.2 for a more detailed discussion of these reported costs.
1018 $250,000 + $500,000 = $750,000. $750,000/2 = $375,000.
1019 This metric is based on a reported national annual average salary for a climate specialist of $114,463. See
glassdoor, How much does a Climate Change Specialist make? (Dec. 2021), available at
https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/climate-change-specialist-salary-SRCH_KO0,25.htm. $114,463/2080 hrs.
= $55/hr. $375,000/$55/hr. = 6,818 hrs. (rounded to nearest dollar).
1020 $200,000 + $350,000 = $550,000. $550,000/2 = $275,000. $275,000/$55/hr. = 5,000 hrs.
1021 6,818 hrs. + 5,000 hrs. + 82 hrs. = 11,900 hrs.; 11,900 hrs./3 = 3,967 hrs.
1022 Unlike this PRA analysis, which assumes that some of the paperwork burden will be borne by in-house
personnel and some by outside professionals, the UK Impact Assessment assumed that all of the work would be
done by in-house personnel.
1023 The UK Impact Assessment’s estimated number of hours for each TCFD-aligned disclosure topic per company
was: 225 hrs. for governance; 295 hrs. for strategy; 245 hrs. for risk management; and (in Year 1) 2,227 hrs. for
metrics and targets, which included one in-house climate-related expert working full-time.
425
collect and process climate-related data from its subsidiaries.1024
 The impact assessment further
estimated on a one-time basis the number of hours and costs that it would take in-house
personnel to become familiar with and review the new climate-related reporting requirements
and related guidance.1025
 The total number of hours that the Impact Assessment estimated it
would take a company to comply with the TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements in the first year
came to 3,447 hours, of which 977.5 hours pertained to qualitative, TCFD-aligned disclosure and
2,469.5 hours pertained to GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure.1026
We also have considered cost estimates from S&P Global, a data analytics firm that
provides ESG consulting services, including climate-related data collection and analysis, among
other services. This firm provided one cost estimate for preparing TCFD-aligned disclosures
primarily covering physical risk and transition risk assessment and analysis, which, for a
company lacking any experience in climate reporting, ranged from $150,000 to $200,000 (an
average of $175,000) in the first year of reporting.
1027
 For a company with prior experience in
GHG emissions reporting but requiring assistance with TCFD-aligned reporting, the firm
1024 This estimate was 85 hrs.
1025 The primary difference between the Initial Impact Assessment and Final Impact Assessment concerned the
estimated “familiarization” costs. The Final Impact Assessment assumed that the rule would require scenario
analysis and added additional hours for in-house personnel to become familiar with scenario analysis
methodology. Because our proposed rules do not require scenario analysis, we are using the familiarization
estimate of the Initial Impact Assessment (323 hrs.) when totaling the estimated hours required to comply with
the UK’s proposed climate disclosure rules. We have added to the familiarization estimate the number of hours
(77 hrs.) that the Final Impact Assessment estimated for the one-time legal review of the new climate disclosure
requirements by in-house personnel.
1026 400 hrs. (familiarization and review) + 195 hrs. (governance) + 295 hrs. (strategy) + 245 hrs. (risk management)
+ 2,227 hrs. (metrics and targets) + 85 hrs. (parent co. processing) = 3,447 hrs. For purposes of the PRA, we
have allocated approximately half of the hours pertaining to familiarization and review and parent company
processing between the qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and the GHG emissions metrics and targets
disclosure. This results in 977.5 hrs. allocated to the qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and 2,469.5 hrs.
allocated to the GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure.
1027 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global. $150,000 + $200,000 =
$350,000; $350,000/2 = $175,000.
426
estimated average costs of $100,000.
1028 This results in an average cost estimate for all
companies for TCFD-aligned disclosures, excluding GHG emissions calculation and reporting,
of $137,500 in the first year of TCFD-aligned reporting.
1029
 For PRA purposes, we have
converted this dollar cost average to 2,500 burden hours.1030
This data analytics firm provided a separate cost estimate for calculating a company’s
Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions.1031
 For the initial calculation of a company’s GHG emissions,
including all three scopes, the cost estimate ranged from $75,000 to $125,000 (an average of
$100,000).1032 The firm also estimated that the setting and reporting of GHG emissions targets
would on average add an additional $25,000, resulting in an average first-year cost estimate for
GHG emissions metrics and targets of $125,000.1033
 For PRA purposes, we have converted this
dollar cost average to 2,273 burden hours.1034
 This results in a total incremental burden increase
(for both TCFD-aligned disclosures and GHG emissions calculation) in the first year of climaterelated reporting of 4,773 burden hours.1035

1028 See id.
1029 $175,000 + $100,000 = $275,000; $275,000/2 = $137,500.
1030 $137,500/$55/hr. = 2,500 hrs.
1031 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of S&P Global. Although the proposed rules
would require the disclosure of a registrant’s Scope 3 emissions only if they are material, this cost estimate is
relevant for determining the upper bound of the proposed rules’ estimated PRA burden.
1032 $75,000 + $125,000 = $200,000; $200,000/2 = $100,000.
1033 Although the proposed rules would not require a registrant to set GHG emissions targets, they would require
certain disclosures if the registrant does set targets. We have therefore included S&P Global’s cost estimate for
targets for purposes of determining the upper bound of the proposed rules’ estimated PRA burden. However,
because setting targets would be voluntary under the proposed rules, the estimated PRA burden may overstate
the potential burden.
1034 $125,000/$55/hr. = 2,273 hrs.
1035 2,500 hrs. + 2,273 hrs. = 4,773 hrs.
427
We also considered the cost estimates for GHG emissions measurement and reporting
provided by two climate management firms, Persefoni and South Pole. Persefoni estimated that,
depending on the maturity of a company’s emissions reporting program, a company’s average
first-year costs for measuring and reporting Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions ranged from $50,000 to
$125,000, which averages to $87,500, or 1,591 hours.1036
 South Pole estimated annual costs for
measuring and reporting Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions as ranging from $11,800 to $118,300,
which averages to $65,050, or 1,183 hours.1037
The UK Impact Assessment estimated that the calculation and reporting of GHG
emissions metrics and related targets would take the greatest amount of time, constituting
approximately 72 percent of the total incremental burden.
1038
 The data analytics firm, however,
estimated that GHG emissions metrics and targets would constitute approximately 48 percent of
the total incremental burden.1039 The burden estimates provided by the above-referenced
commenter and Climate Lab did not allocate between GHG emissions and non-GHG emissions
climate reporting. For purposes of the PRA, we have allocated the burden estimates from the
commenter and Climate Lab equally between the qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and the
GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure.1040

1036 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of Persefoni. $50,000 + $125,000 = $175,000;
$175,000/2 = $87,500; $87,500/$55/hr. = 1,591 hrs.
1037 See memorandum concerning staff meeting with representatives of South Pole. $11,800 + $118,300 =
$130,100; $130,100/2 = $65,050; $65,050/$55/hr. = 1,183 hrs.
1038 See supra note 1026 (2,469.5 hrs./3,447 hrs. = 72 percent).
1039 See supra note 1035 (2,273 hrs./4,773 hrs. = 48 percent).
1040 For the Society for Corporate Governance-derived estimate, this results in 3,406.5 hrs. for each of the
qualitative TCFD-aligned disclosure and the GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure. For the Climate
Lab-derived burden estimate, this results in 1,983.5 burden hrs. for each of the qualitative and quantitative
disclosures.
428
Based on the above sources, we estimate that the proposed qualitative TCFD-aligned
disclosures would result in an average incremental burden hour increase of 2,217 hrs. for each
affected collection of information for the first year of climate reporting.
1041
 We estimate that the
proposed GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure would result in an average incremental
burden hour increase of 2,151 hours for each affected collection of information for the first year
of reporting.1042
In addition to GHG emissions metrics, the proposed rules would require the disclosure of
certain climate-related financial statement metrics. Although the TCFD recommends the
disclosure of metrics pertaining to the financial impacts of climate-related events and conditions,
it is unclear whether the above sources’ burden estimates for TCFD-aligned disclosure would
include financial statement metrics. Based on staff experience reviewing financial statements,
we estimate that preparation of the financial statements to present the proposed financial
statement metrics would require 70 additional burden hours per filing. To ensure that our PRA
estimates cover the burden associated with the proposed climate-related financial statement
metrics, we have included this amount, in addition to the burden estimate for GHG emissions
metrics and targets, in the estimated overall PRA burden of the proposed rules.
The proposed rules would require a registrant to present the climate-related financial
statement metrics and associated disclosures in a note to its financial statements, which would be
audited. Because the audit of such information would be part of the registrant’s overall audit of
its financial statements, we expect the incremental audit costs associated with these climate1041 3,406.5 hrs. (Society) + 1,983.5 hrs. (Climate Lab) + 977.5 hrs. (UK) +2,500 hrs. (S&P Global) = 8,867.5 hrs.;
8,867.5/4 = 2,217 hrs. (rounded to the nearest whole number).
1042 3,406.5 hrs. (Society) + 1,983.5 hrs. (Climate Lab) + 2,469.5 hrs. (UK) + 2,273 hrs. (S&P Global) + 1,591 hrs.
(Persefoni) + 1,183 hrs. (South Pole) = 12,906.5 hrs.; 12,906.5 hrs./6 = 2,151 hrs.
429
related financial statement metrics and disclosures to be modest.1043
 We are conservatively
estimating that auditing the note pertaining to the climate-related financial statement metrics and
associated disclosures would add audit fees of $15,000 to the overall costs associated with the
audit of the registrant’s financial statements. We derived this estimate by first estimating costs
as an average percentage of total audit fees (1.5%)1044 and then applying that percentage to
median audit fees of $690,000,1045 which results in $10,350. To be conservative, we have
increased this amount to $15,000 for estimated audit fees. We believe that this estimate
represents the average cost of the incremental efforts that may be incurred, taking into
consideration factors such as the scale and complexity of different registrants and the extent of
impact by climate-related events (e.g., location of operations, nature of business). This cost also
takes into consideration the need to understand and evaluate the registrants’ processes and
internal controls associated with the reporting of the climate-related financial statement metrics
and associated disclosures.
1043 This belief is based on post-implementation review observations and activities from accounting standards that
provided further disaggregation of information and that are analogous to the proposed financial statement
metrics requirements, as discussed supra Section II.F.2.a (e.g., segment reporting and disaggregation of
revenue). See FASB’s post-implementation review report on FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (Dec. 2012), 11, (“Preparers’ incremental costs to
implement and comply with Statement 131 generally were not significant and were in line with expectations”),

models, or maintain dual models during the transition period, most of those costs were nonrecurring. For users

1044 The staff estimated a range of 0.5% to 2.5%, which averages to 1.5%.
1045 This is based on staff review of Audit Analytics data for 2020.

The proposed rules would require a registrant that is a large accelerated filer1046 or an
accelerated filer1047 to include, in the relevant filing, an attestation report covering the disclosure
of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and to provide certain related disclosures. Following a
one-year phase-in period in which no attestation report would be required, for filings made for
the second and third fiscal years following the compliance date for the GHG emissions
disclosure requirement, large accelerated filers would be required to obtain an attestation report
for their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, at minimum, at a limited assurance level. We
estimate the cost of a limited assurance attestation report covering a large accelerated filer’s
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions to be $110,000.1048
 Commencing with the fourth fiscal year following
the compliance date and thereafter, a large accelerated filer would be required to obtain an
attestation report covering its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure at a reasonable assurance
level. We estimate the cost for such a reasonable assurance attestation report to be $175,000.1049

This results in an initial six-year average1050 assurance cost for a large accelerated filer’s Scopes
1 and 2 emissions of $124,167.
1051

Following a one-year phase-in period in which no attestation report would be required,
for filings made for the second and third fiscal years following the compliance date for the GHG
1046 Based on staff review of filings made in 2020, large accelerated filers filed approximately 31% of domestic
forms and approximately 37% of Form 20-Fs in 2020. For PRA purposes, we have used 37% as a proxy for the
percentage of all foreign private issuer forms filed by large accelerated filers in 2020.
1047 Based on staff review of filings made in 2020, accelerated filers filed approximately 11% of domestic forms and
15% of Form 20-Fs in 2020.
1048 See supra Section IV.C.2.a.3. for the basis of this limited assurance cost estimate.
1049 See id.
1050 In order to capture three years of the cost of a reasonable assurance attestation report required for accelerated
filers and large accelerated filers, which requirement does not commence until the fourth fiscal year following
the proposed rules’ compliance date, we have used a six-year average when calculating the estimated paperwork
burden effects of the proposed rules.
1051 0 + $110,000 + $110,000 + $175,000 + $175,000 + $175,000 = $745,000; $745,000/6 = $124,167.

emissions disclosure requirement, accelerated filers would be required to obtain an attestation
report for their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure, at minimum, at a limited assurance level.
We estimate the cost of a limited assurance attestation report covering an accelerated filer’s
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions to be $45,000.1052
 Commencing with the fourth fiscal year following
the compliance date and thereafter, an accelerated filer would be required to obtain an attestation
report covering its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure at a reasonable assurance level. We
estimate the cost for such a reasonable assurance attestation report to be $75,000.1053
 This results
in an initial six-year average assurance cost for an accelerated filer’s Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of
$52,500.
1054
The proposed rules would require a registrant that is not required to include a GHG
emissions attestation report to state whether any of the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures
were subject to third-party attestation or verification. If so, the registrant would be required to
identify the provider of assurance or verification and disclose certain additional information,
such as the level and scope of assurance or verification provided, among other matters.1055
 The
burden and costs for this disclosure are encompassed within the estimated overall internal burden
and costs for the proposed GHG emissions disclosure.
The UK Impact Assessment assumed a 25 percent reduction in hour and cost estimates
for the work required to comply with the GHG emissions metrics and targets disclosure
requirement in Year 2 compared to Year 1 because initial implementation of the metrics and
1052 See supra Section IV.C.2.a.3. for the basis of this limited assurance cost estimate.
1053 See id.
1054 0 + $45,000 + $45,000 + $75,000 + $75,000 + $75,000 = $315,000; $315,000/6 = $52,500.
1055 See proposed 17 CFR 229.1505(e).
432
targets framework would not need to be repeated. We believe this assumption is reasonable and
have made a similar reduction after the first year of compliance when calculating the four-year
average for the estimated paperwork burden hour effect of the proposed rules. We also have
assumed a 10 percent reduction in the hour and cost estimates for preparing and providing the
disclosures for the other TCFD-aligned topics in Years 2 through 6 compared to Year 1. We
believe that this assumption is reasonable because the burden hours and costs associated with
becoming familiar with the other TCFD disclosure topics would not need to be repeated.1056
 We
believe that the reduction in the compliance burden and costs for the metrics and targets
disclosure requirement would be greater than the reduction for the other TCFD-aligned
disclosure topics because the initial work to implement a climate data collection and reporting
framework to comply with the metrics and targets requirement would be greater than the initial
framework required for the other disclosure requirements.
SRCs, which comprise 50 percent of domestic filers, and 45 percent of total affected
registrants,1057 would bear a lesser compliance burden because those registrants would not be
subject to the proposed disclosure requirement pertaining to Scope 3 emissions, which, of the
three types of GHG emissions, poses the greatest challenge to calculate and report. We
accordingly estimate that the increase in the PRA burden pertaining to the GHG emissions
requirement for SRCs filing on domestic forms would be approximately 50% less than the
1056 S&P Global estimated a similar reduction in costs in subsequent years, the magnitude of which depends on the
extent of material changes to the TCFD-aligned disclosure and the GHG emissions metrics.
1057 In 2020, there were 6,220 domestic filers + 740 foreign private issuer (fpi) filers = 6,960 affected filers. 3,110
domestic filers + 740 fpi filers = 3,850 non-SRC filers. 3,850/6,960 = 55%. 3,110 filers were SRCs in 2020.
3,110/6,960 = 45%. See supra Section IV.B.
433
increased burden for the GHG emissions requirement for non-SRC registrants.1058
 Smaller
foreign private issuers that file on the foreign private issuer forms would not be eligible for this
adjustment because those foreign private issuers are excluded from the definition of, and
therefore cannot be, SRCs.1059

In addition to requiring the annual climate disclosures, the proposed rules would require a
registrant to disclose any material change to its climate-related disclosures reported in its annual
Exchange Act annual report (Form 10-K or 20-F) on a Form 10-Q (if a domestic filer) or a Form
6-K (if a foreign private issuer filer). We would not expect a registrant to report such a material
change until its second year of compliance, at the earliest. Based on the staff’s assessment of the
amount of time it would take to determine that there has been a material change in the previously
reported climate disclosure, particularly concerning its GHG emissions metrics, and to prepare
disclosures regarding the material change, if any, we estimate a burden hour increase of 40 hours
per form, or an initial six-year average of 33 hours per form.1060
The following table summarizes the estimated paperwork burden effects of the proposed
amendments for non-SRC and SRC registrants associated with the affected collections of
information.

for Non-SRC and SRC Registrants1
1058 This is generally consistent with some of the cost estimates obtained for calculating and reporting Scopes 1, 2,
and 3 emissions. For example, Persefoni indicated that the annual GHG emissions costs for a company having
experience calculating and reporting GHG emissions would double if it included Scope 3 emissions after
calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. See supra note 1013. In addition, S&P Global indicated that a
company’s annual ongoing reporting costs of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions would, at a minimum, increase from
$40,000 to $75,000 if it included Scope 3 emissions. See supra note 1012.
1059 See, e.g., Instruction 2 to the definition of smaller reporting company under 17 CFR 230.405.

C. Incremental and Aggregate Burden and Cost Estimates for the Proposed
Amendments
Below we estimate the incremental and aggregate increase in paperwork burden resulting
from the proposed amendments. These estimates represent the average burden for all issuers,
both large and small. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens will likely vary
among individual registrants based on a number of factors, including the nature of their business,
the size and complexity of their operations, and whether they are subject to similar climaterelated disclosure requirements in other jurisdictions or already preparing similar disclosures on
a voluntary basis. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is to be allocated between internal
burden hours and outside professional costs. The table below sets forth the percentage estimates
we typically use for the burden allocation for each affected collection of information. We also
estimate that the average cost of retaining outside professionals is $400 per hour.
1061

Information
We estimate that the proposed amendments would change the burden per response, but
not the frequency, of the existing collections of information. The burden increase estimates for
1061 We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would be an average of
$400 per hour.

each collection of information were calculated by multiplying the number of responses by the
increased estimated average amount of time it would take to prepare and review the disclosure
required under the affected collection of information (using the estimated three-year average
increase). Since 50 percent of the domestic filers in 2020 were non-SRCs and 50 percent were
SRCs, we assume for purposes of our PRA estimates that 50 percent of each domestic collection
of information was filed by non-SRCs and 50 percent by SRCs. The table below illustrates the
incremental change to the annual compliance burden of the affected collections of information,
in hours and costs.

VI. INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
This Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis (“IRFA”) has been prepared, and made
available for public comment, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”).1063
 It
relates to the proposal to add new subpart 1500 to Regulation S-K and new Article 14 to
Regulation S-X, which would require registrants to provide certain climate-related disclosures in
their Securities Act and Exchange Act registration statements and Exchange Act reports. As
required by the RFA, this IRFA describes the impact of these proposed amendments of
Regulations S-K and S-X on small entities.1064
A. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action
We are proposing to require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in
their registration statements and annual reports, including certain information about climaterelated financial risks and climate-related financial metrics in their financial statements. The
disclosure of this information would provide consistent, comparable, and decision-useful
information to investors to enable them to make informed judgments about the impact of
climate-related risks on current and potential investments. Information about climate-related
1063 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
1064 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
444
risks can have an impact on public companies’ financial performance or position and may be
material to investors in making investment or voting decisions. For this reason, many
investors—including shareholders, investment advisors, and investment management
companies—currently seek information about climate-related risks from companies to inform
their investment decision-making. Furthermore, many companies have begun to provide some of
this information voluntarily in response to investor demand and in recognition of the potential
financial effects of climate-related risks on their businesses. We are concerned that the existing
voluntary disclosures of climate-related risks do not adequately protect investors. For this
reason, mandatory disclosures may be necessary or appropriate to improve the consistency,
comparability, and reliability of this information. The reasons for, and objectives of, the
proposed amendments are discussed in more detail in Section II above.
B. Legal Basis
We are proposing the amendments contained in this release under the authority set forth
in Sections 7, 10, 19(a), and 28 of the Securities Act, as amended, and Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 15,
23(a), and 36 of the Exchange Act, as amended.
C. Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rules
The proposed amendments would affect some issuers that are small entities. The RFA
defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small organization,” or “small governmental
jurisdiction.”1065
 For purposes of the RFA, under 17 CFR 240.0-10(a), an issuer, other than an
investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5
1065 5 U.S.C. 601(6).
445
million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and, under 17 CFR 230.157, is also
engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities that does not exceed $5 million.
The proposed rules would apply to a registrant when filing a Securities Act or Exchange
Act registration statement or an Exchange Act annual or other periodic report. We estimate that
there are 1,004 registrants that are small entities that would be affected by the proposed rules.
D. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements
The proposed amendments would require a registrant, including a small entity, to disclose
certain climate-related information, including data about their GHG emissions, when filing a
Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statement or Exchange Act annual or other periodic
report. In particular, like larger registrants, small entities would be required to disclose
information about: the oversight of their boards and management regarding climate-related risks;
any material impacts of climate-related risks on their consolidated financial statements, business,
strategy, and outlook; their risk management of climate-related risks; climate-related targets or
goals, if any; and certain financial statement metrics. In addition, like other registrants, small
entities would be required to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. We anticipate that the
nature of any benefits or costs associated with the above proposed amendments would be similar
for large and small entities. Accordingly, we refer to the discussion of the proposed
amendments’ economic effects on all affected parties, including small entities, in Section IV.C.
Consistent with that discussion, we anticipate that the economic benefits and costs likely would
vary widely among small entities based on a number of factors, including the nature and conduct
of their businesses, which makes it difficult to project the economic impact on small entities with
precision. However, we request comment on how the proposed amendments would affect small
entities.
446
While small entities would not be exempt from the full scope of the proposed
amendments, they would be exempt from the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements, which
would likely impose the greatest compliance burden for registrants due to the complexity of data
gathering, calculation, and assessment required for that type of emissions.1066
 Small entities
would also have a longer transition period to comply with the proposed rules than other
registrants.1067
 We believe that these accommodations would reduce the proposed rules’
compliance burden for small entities that, compared to larger registrants with more resources,
may be less able to absorb the costs associated with reporting of Scope 3 emissions and may
need additional time to allocate the resources necessary to begin providing climate-related
disclosures.
E. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules
The proposed rules do not duplicate or conflict with other existing federal rules. As
discussed in Section IV, some registrants currently report certain GHG emissions via the EPA’s
2009 mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. However, as discussed above, the
reporting requirements of the EPA’s program and the resulting data are different and more suited
to the purpose of building a national inventory of GHG emissions rather than allowing investors
to assess emissions-related risks to individual registrants.
1066 See supra Section II.G.3 and II.L (discussing the proposed exemption from Scope 3 emissions disclosure for
smaller reporting companies).
1067 See supra Section II.L (discussing the proposed additional two years for smaller reporting companies to comply
with the proposed rules compared to large accelerated filers).
447
F. Significant Alternatives
The RFA directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish our stated objectives,
while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. In connection with the
proposed amendments, we considered the following alternatives:
• Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements that take into account the
resources available to small entities;
• Clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under
the rules for small entities;
• Using performance rather than design standards; and
• Exempting small entities from all or part of the requirements.
As discussed above, the proposed amendments would exempt small entities from certain
GHG emissions disclosure requirements that would likely impose the greatest compliance
burden on registrants compared to other proposed disclosure requirements. In addition, while
there would be a transition period for all registrants to comply with the proposed amendments,
small entities would have an additional two more years to comply with the proposed rules than
large accelerated filers and an additional year compared to other registrants. We believe that this
scaled and phased-in approach would help minimize the economic impact of the proposed
amendments on small entities. We are not, however, proposing a complete exemption from the
proposed amendments for SRCs because, due to their broad impact across industries and
jurisdictions, climate-related risks may materially impact the operations and financial condition
of domestic and foreign issuers, both large and small.
For similar reasons, other than the exemption for reporting Scope 3 emissions by SRCs,
we are not proposing to clarify, consolidate, or simplify the proposed disclosure requirements for
448
small entities. A key objective of the proposed amendments is to elicit consistent, comparable
and reliable information about climate-related risks across registrants. Alternative compliance
requirements for small entities could undermine that goal.
The proposed amendments are primarily based on performance standards with some
provisions that are more like design standards. For example, while the proposed amendments
include certain concepts, such as scopes, developed by the GHG Protocol, they do not require a
registrant to use the GHG Protocol’s methodology when calculating its GHG emissions if
another methodology better suits its circumstances. Using a performance standard for
calculation of GHG emissions would provide registrants with some flexibility regarding how to
comply with the proposed GHG emissions requirement while still providing useful information
for investors about the various scopes of emissions. Similarly, the proposed amendments would
require a registrant that is a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer to include an attestation
report covering its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions that would require the report to meet certain
minimum criteria while permitting the filer, at its option, to obtain additional levels of assurance.
In contrast, the proposed amendments would require all registrants, including small entities, to
express their GHG emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas and in the
aggregate, expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Using a design standard for
the expression of a registrant’s GHG emissions would enhance the comparability of this
disclosure for investors.
Request for Comment
We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this IRFA. In
particular, we request comments regarding:
449
• How the proposed rule and form amendments can achieve their objective while lowering
the burden on small entities;
• The number of small entity companies that may be affected by the proposed rule and
form amendments;
• The existence or nature of the potential effects of the proposed amendments on small
entity companies discussed in the analysis;
• How to quantify the effects of the proposed amendments; and
• Whether there are any federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed
amendments.
Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any effect and provide empirical data
supporting the extent of that effect. Comments will be considered in the preparation of the Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed rules are adopted, and will be placed in the same
public file as comments on the proposed rules themselves.
VII. SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”),1068 the Commission must advise OMB as to whether the proposed amendments
constitute a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it
results in or is likely to result in:
• An annual effect on the U.S. economy of $100 million or more;
• A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or
• Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.
1068 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.
450
We request comment on whether our proposal would be a “major rule” for purposes of
SBREFA. In particular, we request comment and empirical data on:
• The potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;
• Any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and
• Any potential adverse effect on competition, investment, or innovation.

3. Add an undesignated center heading and §§ 210.14-01 and 210.14-02 to read as
follows:
Article 14 – Climate-related disclosure
§ 210.14-01 Climate-related disclosure instructions.
(a) General. A registrant must include disclosure pursuant to § 210.14-02 in any filing
that is required to include disclosure pursuant to subpart 229.1500 of this chapter and that also
requires the registrant to include its audited financial statements. The disclosure pursuant to
§ 210.14-02 must be included in a note to the financial statements included in such filing.
452
(b) Definitions. The definitions in § 229.1500 (Item 1500 of Regulation S-K) apply to
this Article 14 of Regulation S-X.
(c) Basis of calculation. When calculating the metrics in this Article 14, except where
otherwise indicated, a registrant must:
(1) Use financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of its
consolidated financial statements included in the filing; and
(2) Whenever applicable, apply the same accounting principles that it is required to apply
in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing.
(d) Historical periods. Disclosure must be provided for the registrant’s most recently
completed fiscal year, and for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the consolidated financial
statements in the filing (e.g., a registrant that is required to include balance sheets as of the end
of its two most recent fiscal years and income statements and cash flow statements as of the end
of its three most recent fiscal years would be required to disclose two years of the climate-related
metrics that correspond to balance sheet line items and three years of the climate-related metrics
that correspond to income statement or cash flow statement line items).
§ 210.14-02 Climate-related metrics.
(a) Contextual information. Provide contextual information, describing how each
specified metric was derived, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used,
and, if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the specified metrics.
(b) Disclosure thresholds.
(1) Disclosure of the financial impact on a line item in the registrant’s consolidated
financial statements pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (including any impacts
included pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section) is not required if the sum of the
453
absolute values of all the impacts on the line item is less than one percent of the total line item
for the relevant fiscal year.
(2) Disclosure of the aggregate amount of expenditure expensed or the aggregate amount
of capitalized costs incurred pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section (including any
impacts included pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section) is not required if such amount
is less than one percent of the total expenditure expensed or total capitalized costs incurred,
respectively, for the relevant fiscal year.
(c) Financial impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions. Disclose
the impact of severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as flooding, drought,
wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise on any relevant line items in the registrant’s
consolidated financial statements during the fiscal years presented. Disclosure must be
presented, at a minimum, on an aggregated line-by-line basis for all negative impacts and,
separately, at a minimum, on an aggregated line-by-line basis for all positive impacts. Impacts
may include, for example:
(1) Changes to revenues or costs from disruptions to business operations or supply
chains;
(2) Impairment charges and changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as inventory,
intangibles, and property, plant and equipment) due to the assets being exposed to severe
weather, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise;
(3) Changes to loss contingencies or reserves (such as environmental reserves or loan loss
allowances) due to impact from severe weather events; and
(4) Changes to total expected insured losses due to flooding or wildfire patterns.
454
(d) Financial impacts related to transition activities. Disclose the impact of any efforts
to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on any relevant line
items in the registrant’s consolidated financial statements during the fiscal years presented.
Disclosure must be presented, at a minimum, on an aggregated line-by-line basis for all negative
impacts and, separately, at a minimum, on an aggregated line-by-line basis for all positive
impacts. Impacts may include, for example:
(1) Changes to revenue or cost due to new emissions pricing or regulations resulting in
the loss of a sales contract;
(2) Changes to operating, investing, or financing cash flow from changes in upstream
costs, such as transportation of raw materials;
(3) Changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as intangibles and property, plant, and
equipment) due to, among other things, a reduction of the asset’s useful life or a change in the
asset’s salvage value by being exposed to transition activities; and
(4) Changes to interest expense driven by financing instruments such as climate-linked
bonds issued where the interest rate increases if certain climate-related targets are not met.
(e) Expenditure to mitigate risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions.
Disclose separately the aggregate amount of expenditure expensed and the aggregate amount of
capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented to mitigate the risks from severe
weather events and other natural conditions, such as flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme
temperatures, and sea level rise. For example, a registrant may be required to disclose the
amount of expense or capitalized costs, as applicable, to increase the resilience of assets or
operations, retire or shorten the estimated useful lives of impacted assets, relocate assets or
455
operations at risk, or otherwise reduce the future impact of severe weather events and other
natural conditions on business operations.
(f) Expenditure related to transition activities. Disclose separately the aggregate amount
of expenditure expensed and the aggregate amount of capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal
years presented to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks. For
example, a registrant may be required to disclose the amount of expense or capitalized costs, as
applicable, related to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets,
infrastructure, or products that are intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy
efficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy credits), or improve other resource efficiency. A
registrant that has disclosed GHG emissions reduction targets or other climate-related
commitments must disclose the expenditures and costs related to meeting its targets,
commitments, and goals, if any, in the fiscal years presented.
(g) Financial estimates and assumptions impacted by severe weather events and other
natural conditions. Disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to
produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and
uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural
conditions, such as flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise. If yes,
provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions
were impacted by such events.
(h) Financial estimates and assumptions impacted by transition activities. Disclose
whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the consolidated financial
statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a
potential transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate-related targets disclosed by the
456
registrant. If yes, provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and
assumptions were impacted by such a potential transition or the registrant’s disclosed climaterelated targets.
(i) Impact of identified climate-related risks. A registrant must also include the impact of
any climate-related risks (separately by physical risks and transition risks, as defined in
§ 229.1500(c) of this chapter), identified by the registrant pursuant to § 229.1502(a) of this
chapter, on any of the financial statement metrics disclosed pursuant to paragraphs (c) through
(h) of this section.
(j) Impact of climate-related opportunities. A registrant may also include the impact of
any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of
efforts to pursue climate-related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact
of any other climate-related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to
§ 229.1502(a) of this chapter, on any of the financial statement metrics disclosed pursuant to
paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. If a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the
impact of an opportunity, it must do so consistently for the fiscal years presented, including for
each financial statement line item and all relevant opportunities identified by the registrant.

Subpart 229.1500—Climate-Related Disclosure
§ 229.1500 (Item 1500) Definitions.
As used in this subpart, these terms have the following meanings:
(a) Carbon offsets represents an emissions reduction or removal of greenhouse gases
(“GHG”) in a manner calculated and traced for the purpose of offsetting an entity’s GHG
emissions.

climate-related conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements,
business operations, or value chains, as a whole.
(c) Climate-related risks means the actual or potential negative impacts of climate-related
conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or
value chains, as a whole. Climate-related risks include the following:
(1) Physical risks include both acute risks and chronic risks to the registrant’s business
operations or the operations of those with whom it does business.
458
(2) Acute risks are event-driven and may relate to shorter term extreme weather events,
such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes, among other events.
(3) Chronic risks relate to longer term weather patterns and related effects, such as
sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, drought, and increased wildfires, as well as related
effects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased habitability of land, and decreased
availability of fresh water.
(4) Transition risks are the actual or potential negative impacts on a registrant’s
consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains attributable to regulatory,
technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate-related
risks, such as increased costs attributable to changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for
carbon-intensive products leading to decreased prices or profits for such products, the
devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs,
competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts
(including those stemming from a registrant’s customers or business counterparties) that might
trigger changes to market behavior, consumer preferences or behavior, and registrant behavior.
(d) Carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) means the common unit of measurement to
indicate the global warming potential (“GWP”) of each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of
the GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide (“CO2”).
(e) Emission factor means a multiplication factor allowing actual GHG emissions to be
calculated from available activity data or, if no activity data is available, economic data, to derive
absolute GHG emissions. Examples of activity data include kilowatt-hours of electricity used,
quantity of fuel used, output of a process, hours of operation of equipment, distance travelled,
and floor area of a building.
459
(f) Global warming potential (“GWP”) means a factor describing the global warming
impacts of different greenhouse gases. It is a measure of how much energy will be absorbed in
the atmosphere over a specified period of time as a result of the emission of one ton of a
greenhouse gas, relative to the emissions of one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2).
(g) Greenhouse gases (“GHG”) means carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (“CH4”), nitrous
oxide (“N2O”), nitrogen trifluoride (“NF3”), hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”), perfluorocarbons
(“PFCs”), and sulfur hexafluoride (“SF6”).
(h) GHG emissions means direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases expressed in
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), of which:
(1) Direct emissions are GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a
registrant.
(2) Indirect emissions are GHG emissions that result from the activities of the registrant,
but occur at sources not owned or controlled by the registrant.
(i) GHG intensity (or carbon intensity) means a ratio that expresses the impact of GHG
emissions per unit of economic value (e.g., metric tons of CO2e per unit of total revenues, using
the registrant’s reporting currency) or per unit of production (e.g., metric tons of CO2e per
product produced).
(j) Internal carbon price means an estimated cost of carbon emissions used internally
within an organization.
(k) Location means a ZIP code or, in a jurisdiction that does not use ZIP codes, a similar
subnational postal zone or geographic location.
(l) Operational boundaries means the boundaries that determine the direct and indirect
emissions associated with the business operations owned or controlled by a registrant.
460
(m) Organizational boundaries means the boundaries that determine the operations
owned or controlled by a registrant for the purpose of calculating its GHG emissions.
(n) Renewable energy credit or certificate (“REC”) means a credit or certificate
representing each megawatt-hour (1 MWh or 1,000 kilowatt-hours) of renewable electricity
generated and delivered to a power grid.
(o) Scenario analysis means a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of
outcomes of various possible future climate scenarios, and how climate-related risks may impact
a registrant’s operations, business strategy, and consolidated financial statements over time. For
example, registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies under
certain future climate scenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 °C,
2 °C, and 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels.
(p) Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned or
controlled by a registrant.
(q) Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or
acquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or controlled
by a registrant.
(r) Scope 3 emissions are all indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a
registrant’s Scope 2 emissions, which occur in the upstream and downstream activities of a
registrant’s value chain.
(1) Upstream activities in which Scope 3 emissions might occur include:
(i) A registrant’s purchased goods and services;
(ii) A registrant’s capital goods;
461
(iii) A registrant’s fuel and energy related activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2
emissions;
(iv) Transportation and distribution of purchased goods, raw materials, and other inputs;
(v) Waste generated in a registrant’s operations;
(vi) Business travel by a registrant’s employees;
(vii) Employee commuting by a registrant’s employees; and
(viii) A registrant’s leased assets related principally to purchased or acquired goods or
services.
(2) Downstream activities in which Scope 3 emissions might occur include:
(i) Transportation and distribution of a registrant’s sold products, goods or other outputs;
(ii) Processing by a third party of a registrant’s sold products;
(iii) Use by a third party of a registrant’s sold products;
(iv) End-of-life treatment by a third party of a registrant’s sold products;
(v) A registrant’s leased assets related principally to the sale or disposition of goods or
services;
(vi) A registrant’s franchises; and
(vii) Investments by a registrant.
(s) Transition plan means a registrant’s strategy and implementation plan to reduce
climate-related risks, which may include a plan to reduce its GHG emissions in line with its own
commitments or commitments of jurisdictions within which it has significant operations.
(t) Value chain means the upstream and downstream activities related to a registrant’s
operations. Upstream activities in connection with a value chain may include activities by a
party other than the registrant that relate to the initial stages of a registrant’s production of a good
462
or service (e.g., materials sourcing, materials processing, and supplier activities). Downstream
activities in connection with a value chain may include activities by a party other than the
registrant that relate to processing materials into a finished product and delivering it or providing
a service to the end user (e.g., transportation and distribution, processing of sold products, use of
sold products, end of life treatment of sold products, and investments).
§ 229.1501 (Item 1501) Governance.
(a)(1) Describe the board of director’s oversight of climate-related risks. Include the
following, as applicable:
(i) The identity of any board members or board committee responsible for the oversight

(a) Describe any climate-related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact on the
registrant, including on its business or consolidated financial statements, which may manifest
over the short, medium, and long term. If applicable, a registrant may also disclose the actual
and potential impacts of any climate-related opportunities when responding to any of the
provisions in this section.
(1) Discuss such climate-related risks, specifying whether they are physical or transition
risks and the nature of the risks presented.
(i) For physical risks, describe the nature of the risk, including if it may be categorized as
an acute or chronic risk, and the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations
subject to the physical risk.
464
(A) If a risk concerns the flooding of buildings, plants, or properties located in flood
hazard areas, disclose the percentage of those assets (square meters or acres) that are located in
flood hazard areas in addition to their location.
(B) If a risk concerns the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high water
stress, disclose the amount of assets (e.g., book value and as a percentage of total assets) located
in those regions in addition to their location. Also disclose the percentage of the registrant’s total
water usage from water withdrawn in those regions.
(ii) For transition risks, describe the nature of the risk, including whether it relates to
regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and
investor preferences), liability, reputational, or other transition-related factors, and how those
factors impact the registrant. A registrant that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has
made a GHG emissions reduction commitment may be exposed to transition risks related to the
implementation of the commitment.
(2) Describe how the registrant defines short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons,
including how it takes into account or reassesses the expected useful life of the registrant’s assets
and the time horizons for the registrant’s climate-related planning processes and goals.

response to paragraph (a) of this section on the registrant’s strategy, business model, and
outlook.
(1) Include impacts on the registrant’s:
(i) Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations;
(ii) Products or services;
(iii) Suppliers and other parties in its value chain;
465
(iv) Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, including adoption of new
technologies or processes;
(v) Expenditure for research and development; and
(vi) Any other significant changes or impacts.
(2) Include the time horizon for each described impact (i.e., in the short, medium, or long
term, as defined in response to paragraph (a) of this section).
(c) Discuss whether and how any impacts described in response to paragraph (b) of this
section are considered as part of the registrant’s business strategy, financial planning, and capital
allocation. Provide both current and forward-looking disclosures that facilitate an understanding
of whether the implications of the identified climate-related risks have been integrated into the
registrant’s business model or strategy, including how any resources are being used to mitigate
climate-related risks. Include in this discussion how any of the metrics referenced in § 210.14-
02 of this chapter and § 229.1504 or any of the targets referenced in § 229.1506 relate to the
registrant’s business model or business strategy. If applicable, include in this discussion the role
that carbon offsets or RECs play in the registrant’s climate-related business strategy.
(d) Provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any climate-related risks described
in response to paragraph (a) of this section have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the
registrant’s consolidated financial statements. The discussion should include any of the climaterelated metrics referenced in § 210.14-02 of this chapter that demonstrate that the identified
climate-related risks have had a material impact on reported financial condition or operations.
(e)(1) If a registrant maintains an internal carbon price, disclose:
(i) The price in units of the registrant’s reporting currency per metric ton of CO2e;
466
(ii) The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over time, if
applicable;
(iii) The boundaries for measurement of overall CO2e on which the total price is based if
different from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to § 229.1504(e)(2);
and
(iv) The rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.
(2) Describe how the registrant uses any internal carbon price described in response to
paragraph (e)(1) of this section to evaluate and manage climate-related risks.
(3) If a registrant uses more than one internal carbon price, it must provide the disclosures
required by this section for each internal carbon price, and disclose its reasons for using different
prices.
(f) Describe the resilience of the registrant’s business strategy in light of potential future
changes in climate-related risks. Describe any analytical tools, such as scenario analysis, that the
registrant uses to assess the impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated
financial statements, and to support the resilience of its strategy and business model. If the
registrant uses scenario analysis to assess the resilience of its business strategy to climate-related
risks, disclose the scenarios considered (e.g., an increase of no greater than 3 ºC, 2 ºC, or 1.5 ºC
above pre-industrial levels), including parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices, and the
projected principal financial impacts on the registrant’s business strategy under each scenario.
The disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information.
§ 229.1503 (Item 1503) Risk management.
(a) Describe any processes the registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing
climate-related risks. If applicable, a registrant may also describe any processes for identifying,
467
assessing, and managing climate-related opportunities when responding to any of the provisions
in this section.
(1) When describing any processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks,
disclose, as applicable, how the registrant:
(i) Determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared to other risks;
(ii) Considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG
emissions limits, when identifying climate-related risks;
(iii) Considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes, or
changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and
(iv) Determines the materiality of climate-related risks, including how it assesses the
potential scope and impact of an identified climate-related risk, such as the risks identified in
response to § 229.1502.
(2) When describing any processes for managing climate-related risks, disclose, as
applicable, how the registrant:
(i) Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to a particular risk;
(ii) Prioritizes whether to address climate-related risks; and
(iii) Determines how to mitigate any high priority risks.
(b) Disclose whether and how any processes described in response to paragraph (a) of
this section are integrated into the registrant’s overall risk management system or processes. If a
separate board or management committee is responsible for assessing and managing climaterelated risks, a registrant should disclose how that committee interacts with the registrant’s board
or management committee governing risks.
468
(c)(1) If the registrant has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk
management strategy, describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to
identify and manage any physical and transition risks. To allow for an understanding of the
registrant’s progress to meet the plan’s targets or goals over time, a registrant must update its
disclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the
year to achieve the plan’s targets or goals.
(2) If the registrant has adopted a transition plan, discuss, as applicable:
(i) How the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified physical risks, including
but not limited to those concerning energy, land, or water use and management;
(ii) How the registrant plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks,
including the following:
(A) Laws, regulations, or policies that:
(1) Restrict GHG emissions or products with high GHG footprints, including emissions
caps; or
(2) Require the protection of high conservation value land or natural assets;
(B) Imposition of a carbon price; and
(C) Changing demands or preferences of consumers, investors, employees, and business
counterparties.
(3) If applicable, a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climaterelated risk management strategy may also describe how it plans to achieve any identified
climate-related opportunities, such as:
(i) The production of products that may facilitate the transition to a lower carbon
economy, such as low emission modes of transportation and supporting infrastructure;
469
(ii) The generation or use of renewable power;
(iii) The production or use of low waste, recycled, or other consumer products that
require less carbon intensive production methods;
(iv) The setting of conservation goals and targets that would help reduce GHG emissions;
and
(v) The provision of services related to any transition to a lower carbon economy.
§ 229.1504 (Item 1504) GHG emissions metrics.
(a) General. Disclose a registrant’s GHG emissions, as defined in § 229.1500(h), for its
most recently completed fiscal year, and for the historical fiscal years included in its
consolidated financial statements in the filing, to the extent such historical GHG emissions data
is reasonably available.
(1) For each required disclosure of a registrant’s Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, disclose
the emissions both disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas, as specified in
§ 229.1500(g), and in the aggregate, expressed in terms of CO2e.
(2) When disclosing a registrant’s Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, exclude the impact of
any purchased or generated offsets.
(b) Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.
(1) Disclose the registrant’s total Scope 1 emissions and total Scope 2 emissions
separately after calculating them from all sources that are included in the registrant’s
organizational and operational boundaries.
(2) When calculating emissions pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a registrant
may exclude emissions from investments that are not consolidated, are not proportionately
470
consolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting in the registrant’s
consolidated financial statements.
(c) Scope 3 emissions.
(1) Disclose the registrant’s total Scope 3 emissions if material. A registrant must also
disclose its Scope 3 emissions if it has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes
its Scope 3 emissions. Disclosure of a registrant’s Scope 3 emissions must be separate from
disclosure of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, identify
the categories of upstream or downstream activities that have been included in the calculation of
the Scope 3 emissions. If any category of Scope 3 emissions is significant to the registrant,
identify all such categories and provide Scope 3 emissions data separately for them, together
with the registrant’s total Scope 3 emissions.
(2) If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, describe the data sources used to calculate
the registrant’s Scope 3 emissions, including the use of any of the following:
(i) Emissions reported by parties in the registrant’s value chain, and whether such reports
were verified by the registrant or a third party, or unverified;
(ii) Data concerning specific activities, as reported by parties in the registrant’s value
chain; and
(iii) Data derived from economic studies, published databases, government statistics,
industry associations, or other third-party sources outside of a registrant’s value chain, including
industry averages of emissions, activities, or economic data.
(3) A smaller reporting company, as defined by §§ 229.10(f)(1), 230.405, and
240.12b-2 of this chapter, is exempt from, and need not comply with, the disclosure requirements
of this paragraph (c).
471
(d) GHG intensity.
(1) Using the sum of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, disclose GHG intensity in terms of metric
tons of CO2e per unit of total revenue (using the registrant’s reporting currency) and per unit of
production relevant to the registrant’s industry for each fiscal year included in the consolidated
financial statements. Disclose the basis for the unit of production used.
(2) If Scope 3 emissions are otherwise disclosed, separately disclose GHG intensity using
Scope 3 emissions only.
(3) If a registrant has no revenue or unit of production for a fiscal year, it must disclose
another financial measure of GHG intensity or another measure of GHG intensity per unit of
economic output, as applicable, with an explanation of why the particular measure was used.
(4) A registrant may also disclose other measures of GHG intensity, in addition to metric
tons of CO2e per unit of total revenue (using the registrant’s reporting currency) and per unit of
production, if it includes an explanation of why a particular measure was used and why the
registrant believes such measure provides useful information to investors.
(e) Methodology and related instructions.
(1) A registrant must describe the methodology, significant inputs, and significant
assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions. The description of the registrant’s
methodology must include the registrant’s organizational boundaries, operational boundaries
(including any approach to categorization of emissions and emissions sources), calculation
approach (including any emission factors used and the source of the emission factors), and any
calculation tools used to calculate the GHG emissions. A registrant’s description of its approach
to categorization of emissions and emissions sources should explain how it determined the
472
emissions to include as direct emissions, for the purpose of calculating its Scope 1 emissions,
and indirect emissions, for the purpose of calculating its Scope 2 emissions.
(2) The organizational boundary and any determination of whether a registrant owns or
controls a particular source for GHG emissions must be consistent with the scope of entities,
operations, assets, and other holdings within its business organization as those included in, and
based upon the same set of accounting principles applicable to, the registrant’s consolidated
financial statements.
(3) A registrant must use the same organizational boundaries when calculating its Scope
1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions. If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a registrant must
also apply the same organizational boundaries used when determining its Scopes 1 and 2
emissions as an initial step in identifying the sources of indirect emissions from activities in its
value chain over which it lacks ownership and control and which must be included in the
calculation of its Scope 3 emissions. Once a registrant has determined its organizational and
operational boundaries, a registrant must be consistent in its use of those boundaries when
calculating its GHG emissions.
(4) A registrant may use reasonable estimates when disclosing its GHG emissions as long
as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using, the estimates.
(i) When disclosing its GHG emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year, if
actual reported data is not reasonably available, a registrant may use a reasonable estimate of its
GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter, together with actual, determined GHG emissions
data for the first three fiscal quarters, as long as the registrant promptly discloses in a subsequent
filing any material difference between the estimate used and the actual, determined GHG
emissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter.
473
(ii) In addition to the use of reasonable estimates, a registrant may present its estimated
Scope 3 emissions in terms of a range as long as it discloses its reasons for using the range and
the underlying assumptions.
(5) A registrant must disclose, to the extent material and as applicable, any use of thirdparty data when calculating its GHG emissions, regardless of the particular scope of emissions.
When disclosing the use of third-party data, it must identify the source of such data and the
process the registrant undertook to obtain and assess such data.
(6) A registrant must disclose any material change to the methodology or assumptions
underlying its GHG emissions disclosure from the previous fiscal year.
(7) A registrant must disclose, to the extent material and as applicable, any gaps in the
data required to calculate its GHG emissions. A registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure should
provide investors with a reasonably complete understanding of the registrant’s GHG emissions in
each scope of emissions. If a registrant discloses any data gaps encountered when calculating its
GHG emissions, it must also discuss whether it used proxy data or another method to address
such gaps, and how its accounting for any data gaps has affected the accuracy or completeness of
its GHG emissions disclosure.
(8) When determining whether its Scope 3 emissions are material, and when disclosing
those emissions, in addition to emissions from activities in its value chain, a registrant must
include GHG emissions from outsourced activities that it previously conducted as part of its own
operations, as reflected in the financial statements for the periods covered in the filing.
(9) If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, when calculating those emissions, if there
was any significant overlap in the categories of activities producing the Scope 3 emissions, a
474
registrant must describe the overlap, how it accounted for the overlap, and the effect on its
disclosed total Scope 3 emissions.
(f) Liability for Scope 3 emissions disclosures.
(1) A statement within the coverage of paragraph (f)(2) of this section that is made by or
on behalf of a registrant is deemed not to be a fraudulent statement (as defined in paragraph
(f)(3) of this section), unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed without a
reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith.
(2) This paragraph (f) applies to any statement regarding Scope 3 emissions that is
disclosed pursuant to §§ 229.1500 through 229.1506 and made in a document filed with the
Commission.
(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f), the term fraudulent statement shall mean a
statement that is an untrue statement of material fact, a statement false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, an omission to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not
misleading, or that constitutes the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent
device, contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business, or an artifice to
defraud as those terms are used in the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.
§ 229.1505 Attestation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure.
(a) Attestation.
(1) A registrant that is required to provide Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure
pursuant to § 229.1504 and that is an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer must include an
attestation report covering such disclosure in the relevant filing. For filings made by an
accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer for the second and third fiscal years after the
475
compliance date for § 229.1504, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at a limited
assurance level and cover the registrant’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure. For filings
made by an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer for the fourth fiscal year after the
compliance date for § 229.1504 and thereafter, the attestation engagement must be at a
reasonable assurance level and, at a minimum, cover the registrant’s Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions disclosures.
(2) Any attestation report required under this section must be provided pursuant to
standards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a body or group that has
followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public
comment. An accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer obtaining voluntary assurance prior to
the first required fiscal year must comply with subparagraph (e) of this section. Voluntary
assurance obtained by an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer thereafter must follow the
requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section and must use the same attestation
standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and Scope 2.
(b) GHG emissions attestation provider. The GHG emissions attestation report required
by paragraph (a) of this section must be prepared and signed by a GHG emissions attestation
provider. A GHG emissions attestation provider means a person or a firm that has all of the
following characteristics:
(1) Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in
measuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means
having sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:
(i) Perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal
and regulatory requirements; and
476
(ii) Enable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the
circumstances.
(2) Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is
providing the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement period.
(i) A GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is
not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would
conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial
judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation provider’s engagement.
(ii) In determining whether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent, the
Commission will consider:
(A) Whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting
interest between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), places the
attestation provider in the position of attesting such attestation provider’s own work, results in
the attestation provider acting as management or an employee of the registrant (or any of its
affiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position of being an advocate for the registrant
(or any of its affiliates); and
(B) All relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the
attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those relating to
reports filed with the Commission.
(iii) The term “affiliates” as used in this section has the meaning provided in 17 CFR
210.2-01, except that references to “audit” are deemed to be references to the attestation services
provided pursuant to this section.
477
(iv) The term “attestation and professional engagement period” as used in this section
means both:
(A) The period covered by the attestation report; and
(B) The period of the engagement to attest to the registrant’s GHG emissions or to
prepare a report filed with the Commission (“the professional engagement period”). The
professional engagement period begins when the GHG attestation service provider either signs
an initial engagement letter (or other agreement to attest a registrant’s GHG emissions) or begins
attest procedures, whichever is earlier.
(c) Attestation report requirements. The GHG emissions attestation report required by
paragraph (a) of this section must be included in the separately captioned “Climate-Related
Disclosure” section in the filing. The form and content of the attestation report must follow the
requirements set forth by the attestation standard (or standards) used by the GHG emissions
attestation provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at a minimum the report must include the
following:
(1) An identification or description of the subject matter or assertion being reported on,
including the point in time or period of time to which the measurement or evaluation of the
subject matter or assertion relates;
(2) An identification of the criteria against which the subject matter was measured or
evaluated;
(3) A statement that identifies the level of assurance provided and describes the nature of
the engagement;
(4) A statement that identifies the attestation standard (or standards) used;
478
(5) A statement that describes the registrant’s responsibility to report on the subject
matter or assertion being reported on;
(6) A statement that describes the attestation provider’s responsibilities in connection
with the preparation of the attestation report;
(7) A statement that the attestation provider is independent, as required by paragraph (a)
of this section;
(8) For a limited assurance engagement, a description of the work performed as a basis
for the attestation provider’s conclusion;
(9) A statement that describes significant inherent limitations, if any, associated with the
measurement or evaluation of the subject matter against the criteria;
(10) The GHG emissions attestation provider’s conclusion or opinion, based on the
applicable attestation standard(s) used;
(11) The signature of the attestation provider (whether by an individual or a person
signing on behalf of the attestation provider’s firm);
(12) The city and state where the attestation report has been issued; and
(13) The date of the report.
(d) Additional disclosures by the registrant. In addition to including the GHG emissions
attestation report required by paragraph (a) of this section, a large accelerated filer and an
accelerated filer must disclose the following information within the separately captioned
“Climate-Related Disclosure” section in the filing, after requesting relevant information from
any GHG emissions attestation provider as necessary:
479
(1) Whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation
body to provide assurance, and if so, identify the licensing or accreditation body, and whether the
attestation provider is a member in good standing of that licensing or accreditation body;
(2) Whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight
inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs); and
(3) Whether the attestation provider is subject to record-keeping requirements with
respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement and, if so, identify
the record-keeping requirements and the duration of those requirements.
(e) Disclosure of voluntary attestation. A registrant that is not required to include a GHG
emissions attestation report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must disclose within the
separately captioned “Climate-Related Disclosure” section in the filing the following information
if the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third-party attestation or
verification:
(1) Identify the provider of such attestation or verification;
(2) Describe the attestation or verification standard used;
(3) Describe the level and scope of attestation or verification provided;
(4) Briefly describe the results of the attestation or verification;
(5) Disclose whether the third-party service provider has any other business relationships
with or has provided any other professional services to the registrant that may lead to an
impairment of the service provider’s independence with respect to the registrant; and
(6) Disclose any oversight inspection program to which the service provider is subject
(e.g., the AICPA’s peer review program).
§ 229.1506 (Item 1506) Targets and goals.
480
(a)(1) A registrant must provide disclosure pursuant to this section if it has set any targets
or goals related to the reduction of GHG emissions, or any other climate-related target or goal
(e.g., regarding energy usage, water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration, or revenues
from low-carbon products) such as actual or anticipated regulatory requirements, market
constraints, or other goals established by a climate-related treaty, law, regulation, policy, or
organization.
(2) A registrant may provide the disclosure required by this section as part of its
disclosure in response to § 229.1502 or § 229.1503.
(b) If the registrant has set climate-related targets or goals, disclose the targets or goals,
including, as applicable, a description of:
(1) The scope of activities and emissions included in the target;
(2) The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based;
(3) The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether
the time horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty, law,
regulation, policy, or organization;
(4) The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will
be tracked with a consistent base year set for multiple targets;
(5) Any interim targets set by the registrant; and
(6) How the registrant intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals. For example,
for a target or goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could include a
strategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase carbon
offsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage.
481
(c) Disclose relevant data to indicate whether the registrant is making progress toward
meeting the target or goal and how such progress has been achieved. A registrant must update
this disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its
targets or goals.
(d) If carbon offsets or RECs have been used as part of a registrant’s plan to achieve
climate-related targets or goals, disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by the
offsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of the
offsets or RECs, a description and location of the underlying projects, any registries or other
authentication of the offsets or RECs, and the cost of the offsets or RECs.
§ 229.1507 (Item 1507) Interactive data requirement.
Provide the disclosure required by this Subpart 1500 in an Interactive Data File as
required by § 232.405 of this chapter (Rule 405 of Regulation S-T) in accordance with the
