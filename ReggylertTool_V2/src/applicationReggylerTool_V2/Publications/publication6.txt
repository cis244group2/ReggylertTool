SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background
In November 2021, the Commission issued for comment proposed 17 CFR 240.10c-1
(“Rule 10c-1”), Reporting of Securities Loans, under the Exchange Act.1
 The proposed rule is
designed to increase the transparency and efficiency of the securities lending market by requiring
any person that loans a security on behalf of itself or another person to report the material terms
of those securities lending transactions and related information regarding the securities the
person has on loan and available to loan to a registered national securities association
(“RNSA”).
2 The comment period for proposed Rule 10c-1 ended on January 7, 2022.
II. Reopening of Comment Period
On February 25, 2022, the Commission proposed 17 CFR 240.13f-2 (“Rule 13f-2”)3
which is designed to provide greater transparency through the publication of short sale related
data to investors and other market participants. Proposed Rule 13f-2 and related Proposed Form
SHO would require that institutional money managers4 file via the Commission’s Electronic
 1 See Reporting of Securities Loans, Exchange Act Release 93613 (Nov. 18, 2021), 86 FR 69802 (Dec. 8, 2021).
2 Proposed Rule 10c-1 would also require the RNSA to publicly disseminate certain information.
3 Short Position and Short Activity Reporting by Institutional Investment Managers, Exchange Act Release 94313,
Feb. 25, 2022.
4 As defined in Section 13(f)(6)(A) of the Exchange Act and for purposes of proposed Rule 13f-2, “institutional
investment manager” includes any person, other than a natural person, investing in or buying and selling securities
for its own account, and any person exercising investment discretion with respect to the account of another person.
15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(6)(A).
4
Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR), on a monthly basis, certain short sale
related data, some of which would be aggregated and made public.5

The Commission is reopening the comment period for proposed Rule 10c-1 so that
commenters may consider whether there would be any effects of proposed Rule 13f-2 that the
Commission should consider in connection with proposed Rule 10c-1.
The Commission is reopening the comment period for proposed Rule 10c-1 Reporting of
Securities Loans6 until April 1, 2022.
By the Commission.
Date: March 2, 2022.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Deputy Secretary.
 5 In addition to proposed Rule 13f-2 and proposed Form SHO, the Commission proposed: (i) Rule 205, which would
establish a new “buy to cover” order marking requirement for certain purchase orders; and (ii) proposed
amendments to the national market system plan governing the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”), which would
require CAT reporting firms to report “buy to cover” order marking information and reliance on the bona fide
market making exception in the Commission’s short sale rules.
