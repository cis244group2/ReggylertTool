Modernization of Beneficial Ownership Reporting
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is proposing to
amend certain rules that govern beneficial ownership reporting. The proposed amendments
would modernize the filing deadlines for initial and amended beneficial ownership reports filed
on Schedules 13D and 13G. The proposed amendments also would deem holders of certain
cash-settled derivative securities as beneficial owners of the reference equity securities and
clarify the disclosure requirements of Schedule 13D with respect to derivative securities. In
addition, the proposed amendments would clarify and affirm the operation of the regulation as
applied to two or more persons that form a group under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
provide new exemptions to permit such persons to communicate and consult with each other,
jointly engage issuers and execute certain transactions without being subject to regulation as a
group. We also are proposing to amend provisions regarding the date on which Schedules 13D
and 13G filings are deemed to have been made. Finally, we are proposing to require that
Schedules 13D and 13G be filed using a structured, machine-readable data language.
DATES: Comments should be received on or before April 11, 2022.
ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:
Electronic comments:
• Use the Commission’s internet comment form

I. Introduction
We are proposing comprehensive changes to 17 CFR 240.13d-1 through 240.13d-102
(“Regulation 13D-G”) and Regulation S-T to modernize the beneficial ownership reporting
requirements and improve their operation and efficacy. Specifically, we are proposing to: (1)
revise the current deadlines for Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G filings; (2) amend Rule 13d-3
to deem holders of certain cash-settled derivative securities as beneficial owners of the reference
covered class; (3) align the text of Rule 13d-5, as applicable to two or more persons who act as a
group, with the statutory language in Sections 13(d)(3) and (g)(3) of the Exchange Act; and (4)
set forth the circumstances under which two or more persons may communicate and consult with
one another and engage with an issuer without concern that they will be subject to regulation as a
group with respect to the issuer’s equity securities. We also are proposing certain related
technical changes to Regulation S-T in connection with these proposed amendments. Finally, we
are proposing to require that Schedules 13D and 13G be filed using a structured, machinereadable data language.
To address concerns that the current deadlines for Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G
filings are creating information asymmetries in today’s market, we are proposing to:
• Revise the Rule 13d-1(a) filing deadline for the initial Schedule 13D to five days3 after
the date on which a person acquires more than 5% of a covered class of equity

3 Consistent with the current “10-day” deadline in Rule 13d-1(a), the proposed “five-day” deadline for filing the
initial Schedule 13D would be measured in calendar days. If the last day of the initial Schedule 13D deadline falls
on a Federal holiday, a Saturday or a Sunday, then such filing may be made on the next business day thereafter. 17
CFR 240.0-3 (“[I]f the last day on which [a filing] can be accepted as timely filed falls on a Saturday, Sunday or
holiday, such [filing] may be [made] on the first business day following.”). Any reference to “days” in either this
release or any of our proposed amendments means “calendar days,” and any reference to “business days” means
“business days,” as we are proposing to define that term. See infra note 5 for a discussion of our proposed definition
of “business days.”

securities;
4

• Amend Rules 13d-1(e), (f) and (g) to shorten the filing deadline for the initial Schedule
13D required to be filed by certain persons who forfeit their eligibility to report on
Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule 13D to five days after the event that causes the
ineligibility;
• Revise the filing deadline under Rule 13d-2(a) for amendments to Schedule 13D to one
business day5 after the date on which a material change occurs;
• Amend Rules 13d-1(b) and (d) to shorten the deadline for the initial Schedule 13G filing
for Qualified Institutional Investors (“QIIs”)6 and Exempt Investors7 to within five
business days after the last day of the month in which beneficial ownership first exceeds

4 As used in this release, a “covered class” is a class of equity securities described in Section 13(d)(1) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1(i) and generally means, with limited exception, a voting class of equity securities
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.
5 The term “business day” is not defined in Section 13(d) or 13(g) or any rule of Regulation 13D-G. Accordingly,
we are proposing to define “business day” for purposes of Regulation 13D-G to mean any day, other than Saturday,
Sunday or a Federal holiday, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. eastern time.
6 The institutional investors qualified to report on Schedule 13G, in lieu of Schedule 13D and in reliance upon Rule
13d-1(b), include a broker or dealer registered under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, a bank as defined in
Section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, an insurance company as defined in Section 3(a)(19) of the Exchange Act, an
investment company registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, an investment adviser
registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a parent holding company or control person (if
certain conditions are met), an employee benefit plan or pension fund that is subject to the provisions of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a savings association as defined in Section 3(b) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act, a church plan that is excluded from the definition of an investment company under Section
3(c)(14) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, non-U.S. institutions that are the functional equivalent of any of
the institutions listed in Rules 13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (I), so long as the non-U.S. institution is subject to a
regulatory scheme that is substantially comparable to the regulatory scheme applicable to the equivalent U.S.
institution, and related holding companies and groups (collectively, “Qualified Institutional Investors” or “QIIs”).
17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(1)(ii).
7 The term “Exempt Investor” as used in this release refers to persons holding beneficial ownership of more than 5%
of a covered class at the end of the calendar year, but who have not made an acquisition of beneficial ownership
subject to Section 13(d). For example, persons who acquire all their securities prior to the issuer registering the
subject securities under the Exchange Act are not subject to Section 13(d) and persons who acquire not more than
two percent of a covered class within a 12-month period are exempted from Section 13(d) by Section 13(d)(6)(B),
but in both cases are subject to Section 13(g). Section 13(d)(6)(A) exempts acquisitions of subject securities
acquired in a stock-for-stock exchange that is registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
8
5% of a covered class;
• Amend the deadline in Rule 13d-1(c), which permits Passive Investors8 to file an initial
Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule 13D within 10 days after acquiring beneficial
ownership of more than 5% of a covered class, to five days after the date of such an
acquisition;
• Revise the filing deadlines required for amendments to Schedule 13G in Rule 13d-2(b) to
five business days after the end of the month in which a reportable change occurs;
• Amend Rule 13d-2(c) to shorten the filing deadline for Schedule 13G amendments filed
pursuant to that provision to five days after the date on which beneficial ownership first
exceeds 10% of a covered class, and thereafter upon any deviation by more than 5% of
the covered class, with these requirements applying if the thresholds were crossed at any
time during a month; and
• Amend Rule 13d-2(d) to revise the filing deadline for Schedule 13G amendments filed
pursuant to that provision from a “promptly” standard to one business day after the date
on which beneficial ownership exceeds 10% of a covered class, and thereafter upon any
deviation by more than 5% of the covered class.
In addition, instead of an amendment obligation arising for Schedule 13G filers upon the
occurrence of “any change” in the facts previously reported regardless of the materiality of such
change, we are proposing to revise Rule 13d-2(b) to require that an amendment to a Schedule

8 The term “Passive Investors” as used in this release refers to beneficial owners of more than 5% but less than 20%
of a covered class who can certify under Item 10 of Schedule 13G that the subject securities were not acquired or
held for the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer of such securities and were not
acquired in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect. These investors are
ineligible to report beneficial ownership pursuant to Rules 13d-1(b) or (d) but are eligible to report beneficial
ownership on Schedule 13G in reliance upon Rule 13d-1(c).
9
13G be filed only if a “material change” occurs. Further, we are proposing to amend Rule 13(a)
of Regulation S-T to permit Schedules 13D and 13G, and any amendments thereto, that are
submitted by direct transmission on or before 10 p.m. eastern time on a given business day to be
deemed to have been filed on the same business day. This amendment would provide additional
time for beneficial owners to prepare and submit their Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G filings.9

Rule 13(a)(4) of
Regulation S-T.
We also are proposing to add new paragraph (e) to Rule 13d-3 to deem holders of certain
cash-settled derivative securities as beneficial owners of the reference covered class. Holders of
derivative securities settled exclusively in cash do not have enforceable rights or any other
entitlements with respect to the reference security under the terms of the agreement governing
the derivative. Under certain circumstances described more fully below, however, holders of
such derivative securities may have both the incentive and ability to influence or control the
issuer of the reference securities. Accordingly, the proposed amendment would “deem” holders
of such derivative securities to beneficially own the reference securities just as if they held such
securities directly.
The new means of determining who is a beneficial owner proposed in Rule 13d-3(e)
would be applied separately from, and in addition to, Rules 13d-3(a) and (b), which provisions
may, depending upon the facts and circumstances, apply independently from proposed Rule 13d3(e) to persons who purchase or sell cash-settled derivatives. The application of proposed Rule
13d-3(e) would be limited to those persons who hold cash-settled derivatives in the context of
11
changing or influencing control of the issuer of the reference security. By contrast, securitybased swaps, as defined by Exchange Act Section 3(a)(68) and the rules and regulations
thereunder, would not be included among the derivative securities covered by proposed Rule
13d-3(e).
We are proposing amendments that would align the text of Rule 13d-5, as applicable to
two or more persons who act as a group, with the statutory language in Sections 13(d)(3) and
(g)(3) of the Exchange Act.
10 By conforming the rule text to Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3), the
proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5 are intended to remove the potential implication that an
express or implied agreement among group members is a necessary precondition to the
formation of a group under those provisions of the Exchange Act and, by extension, Regulation
13D-G.11 In connection with those proposed amendments, we also are proposing to add a new
provision in Rule 13d-5 that would affirm that if a person, in advance of filing a Schedule 13D,
discloses to any other person that such filing will be made and such other person acquires
securities in the covered class for which the Schedule 13D will be filed, then those persons are
deemed to have formed a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3).
In addition, we are proposing amendments that would revise Rule 13d-6 to set forth
additional exemptions from Sections 13(d) and (g). Specifically, new Rule 13d-6(c) would set
forth the circumstances under which two or more persons may communicate and consult with

10 See 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(3) and (g)(3) (“When two or more persons act as a . . . group for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, or disposing of securities of an issuer, such . . . group shall be deemed a ‘person’ for the purposes of this
subsection.”). The determination of whether two or more persons act as a group under these statutory provisions
depends upon the particular facts and circumstances and may vary on a case-by-case basis.
11 Further, to reinforce that Rule 13d-5, which is currently titled “Acquisition of securities,” is intended to set forth
the circumstances under which an acquisition is deemed to occur for purposes of Section 13(d)(1) and Rule 13d-1,
we also propose to delete Rule 13d-5(b)(2)—which provides that, under certain conditions, a group shall not be
deemed to have made an acquisition if persons take concerted action to make purchases in a covered class directly
from an issuer—and to redesignate it as new Rule 13d-6(b). Rule 13d-6, titled “Exemption of certain acquisitions,”
exempts certain acquisitions from the scope of Section 13(d). Because Rule 13d-5(b)(2) operates as the equivalent
of an exemption, moving Rule 13d-5(b)(2) to Rule 13d-6 would harmonize the subject matter of those rules.
12
one another and engage with an issuer without concern that they will be subject to regulation as a
group with respect to the issuer’s equity securities. New Rule 13d-6(d) would set forth the
circumstances under which two or more persons may enter into an agreement governing a
derivative security in the ordinary course of business without concern that they will become
subject to regulation as a group with respect to the derivative’s reference equity securities. These
two exemptions are designed to provide greater certainty regarding the application of Sections
13(d)(3) and (g)(3), while ensuring that the proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 will
not have a chilling effect on shareholder communications or engagement or impair certain
financial institutions’ capacity to execute strictly commercial transactions in the ordinary course
of their business.
In addition, we are proposing amendments that would revise Schedule 13D to clarify the
disclosure requirements with respect to derivative securities held by a person reporting on that
schedule. Specifically, we are proposing to amend Item 6 to Schedule 13D, codified at Rule
13d-101, to remove any implication that a person is not required to disclose interests in all
derivative securities that use a covered class as a reference security. This proposed amendment
is intended to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the scope of the disclosure obligations of Item 6
of Schedule 13D as to derivative securities, including with respect to derivatives not originating
with the issuer, such as cash-settled options not offered or sold by the issuer and security-based
swaps.
Finally, we are proposing to require that Schedules 13D and 13G be filed using a
structured, machine-readable data language. Specifically, we are proposing to require that all
disclosures, including quantitative disclosures, textual narratives, and identification checkboxes,
on Schedules 13D and 13G to be filed using an XML-based language to make it easier for
investors and markets to access, compile and analyze information that is disclosed on Schedules
13D and 13G. Only the exhibits to Schedules 13D and 13G would remain unstructured.
13
We invite and encourage interested parties to submit comments on any aspect of the
proposed rule amendments. When commenting, please include the reasoning in support of your
position or recommendation and provide any supporting documentation or data.
II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments
A. Proposed Amendments to Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 and Rules 13 and 201 of
Regulation S-T to Revise Filing Deadlines and Filing Date Assignment
We are proposing a series of amendments that would revise the deadlines for filing the
initial and amended beneficial ownership reports on Schedules 13D and 13G and expanding the
timeframe within a given business day in which such filings may be timely made. Specifically,
we are proposing amendments to the following rules:
• Rule 13d-1(a) to shorten the filing deadline for the initial Schedule 13D;
• Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) to shorten the filing deadlines for the initial Schedule 13D for
certain persons who forfeit their eligibility to report on Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule
13D;
• Rules 13d-1(b), (c), and (d) to shorten the filing deadlines for the initial Schedule 13G;
• Rules 13d-2(a) and (b) to revise the filing deadline for amendments to Schedule 13D and
Schedule 13G, respectively, and to align the legal standard that dictates when
amendments to Schedule 13G are required with the relevant statutory provision;
• Rules 13d-2(c) and (d) to revise the filing deadlines for certain other amendments to
Schedule 13G; and
• Rules 13(a) and 201(a) of Regulation S-T to revise the time by which Schedule 13D and
13G filings, including amendments thereto, must be submitted on a given business day in
order to be deemed to have been filed on the same business day and to make a temporary
hardship exemption unavailable to those filings.
14
These proposed amendments are discussed in more detail below.
1. Rule 13d-1(a)
a. Background
Section 13(d)(1) of the Exchange Act requires a disclosure statement to be filed “within
ten days after [an] acquisition [of more than 5% of a covered class] or within such shorter time as
the Commission may establish by rule.”12 Consistent with this provision, Rule 13d-1(a) sets
forth the 10-day filing deadline for the initial Schedule 13D.13 Although the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) amended Section
13(d)(1) to grant the Commission the authority to shorten the deadline for filing the initial
Schedule 13D,

contributes to information asymmetries that could harm investors.
19 In enacting Section 13(d),
including its original mandate of a 10-day filing deadline in 1968, Congress considered the need
to strike an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, providing adequate disclosures to
investors and, on the other hand, not unduly burdening those engaging in change of control
transactions.20 In 2010, Congress reassessed the 10-day deadline established in 1968 and

Corporate Governance, 41 J. CORP. L. 545, 597 (2016) (“[T]he gains that activists make in trading on asymmetric

accompanying text.
17
subsequently amended Section 13(d) to authorize the Commission to shorten the 10-day
deadline. 21 This grant of statutory authority by Congress to establish a shorter deadline clearly
indicates that the current 10-day deadline is not immutable and that the Commission is
empowered to shorten that deadline to address the needs of today’s investors and other market
participants, particularly in light of the technological advancements and other developments in
the financial markets that have occurred since 1968.
22 In reassessing whether or not the current
10-day deadline still serves the primary purposes of Section 13(d), which are to provide
information to the public and the subject issuer about accumulations of a covered class by
persons who had the potential to change or influence control of such issuer23 and to regulate
rapid accumulations of beneficial ownership that occurred within a short period of time,
24 we
have determined that an amendment to Rule 13d-1(a) is needed to adequately support those
regulatory objectives.

21 See supra note 14 and accompanying text.
22 At the same time, however, we recognize significant state law changes have occurred since the enactment of the
Williams Act that have resulted in legal impediments being imposed upon blockholders in the market for corporate
control. See Lucian A. Bebchuk and Robert J. Jackson Jr. supra note 17, at n.54 and accompanying text. These
state law impediments have decreased the incidence of hostile takeover bids and, as a result, “active outside
blockholders filing a Schedule 13D are commonly not expected to seek to acquire control, but rather to monitor and
engage with management and fellow shareholders.” Id. at 56.

b. Proposed Amendments
We believe the 10-day filing deadline for the initial Schedule 13D filing should be
revised in light of advances in technology and developments in the financial markets. Our
proposal to shorten the initial filing deadline for Schedule 13D is consistent with previous
Congressional and Commission efforts to accelerate public disclosures of material information to
the market.25 For example, when the Commission accelerated the deadlines for issuers to submit
their periodic reports, it reasoned that “[s]ignificant technological advances over the last three
decades have both increased the market’s demand for more timely corporate disclosure and the
ability of companies to capture, process and disseminate this information.”26
The Commission has long recognized the benefits of more expedient reporting, stating,

25 For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 amended Section 16(a) to require that change of beneficial
ownership reports under Section 16(a) of Exchange Act be filed by officers, directors and beneficial owners of more
than 10% of a covered class “before the end of the second business day following the day on which the subject
transaction has been executed.” On August 27, 2002, the Commission adopted amendments to implement the
accelerated deadline for Form 4 filings. See Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal
Security Holders, Release No. 34-46421 (Aug. 27, 2002) [67 FR 56461 (Sept. 3, 2002)]. On March 16, 2004, the
Commission amended Form 8-K to generally require that such filings be made within four business days of a
triggering event. In adopting the accelerated timeline, the Commission explained the amended requirement “should
enhance investor confidence in the financial markets.” Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Requirements and
Acceleration of Filing Date, Release No. 34-49424 (Mar. 16, 2004) [69 FR 15593 at 15611 (Mar. 25, 2004)]. The
Commission further explained that “[t]he requirement of enhanced, timely disclosure should raise investors’
expectations regarding the amount and timing of information that reporting companies must make available to the
public” and that “[c]onfidence in the expectation of such enhanced disclosure should provide more certainty to those
investors that they are making investment decisions in a more transparent market, which should reduce market
volatility as a result of uncertainty of the availability of accurate timely information about public companies.” Id.
26 Acceleration of Periodic Report Filing Dates and Disclosure Concerning Website Access to Reports, Release No.
34-46464 (Sept. 5, 2002) [67 FR 58479 (Sept. 16, 2002)]. We recognize that these accelerated deadlines applied to
periodic filings made by issuers, whereas Sections 13(d) and (g) relate to filings made by investors. We also
recognize that the acceleration of these deadlines was prompted, in part, by Section 409 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, which “added Section 13(l) of the Exchange Act . . . [to] require[] disclosure on a rapid and current basis
of such additional information concerning material changes in the financial condition or operations of the issuer,” id.
at n.15 and accompanying text (emphasis added), whereas no such “rapid and current” language exists in Sections
13(d) and 13(g). Nonetheless, the technological advances that have increased both the market’s demand for more
timely disclosure and the ability of issuers to file more rapidly are equally applicable to the information disclosed on
Schedule 13D and available to investors making Schedule 13D filings. For example, Congress recognized the
market’s demand for more timely disclosure of non-issuer filings by accelerating deadline for Section 16 filings in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. See supra note 25. As such, we believe that these technological advances also support
accelerating the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline.
19
for example, that “a lengthy delay before . . . information becomes available makes the
information less valuable to investors.”27 Nonetheless, the deadline for filing an initial Schedule
13D has remained unchanged for over 50 years.
28 We continue to appreciate the need for a
balance to be struck between the requirement that material information be timely disseminated
and the competing interest that undue burdens not be imposed in the change of control context.29
We recognize the chilling effect that a shortening of the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline
could have on a shareholder’s ability and incentive to effect changes at companies that may
benefit all shareholders, particularly where the shortened deadline may increase the costs and
reduce the incentives for those shareholders attempting such change of control efforts.30 We do
not believe, however, that a shortening of the deadline would unduly disrupt that balance, as

27 Id.; see also H.R. Rep. 90-550 (1967) (“The persons seeking control, however, have information about themselves
and about their plans which, if known to investors, might substantially change the assumptions on which the market
price is based. The bill is designed to make relevant facts known so that shareholders have a fair opportunity to
make their decision.”).
28 Although the initial Schedule 13D deadline has not been changed, the idea of shortening the deadline for
beneficial ownership reports has been previously recommended. For example, then-Chairman David S. Ruder
recommended to Congress that the filing deadline for an initial beneficial ownership report be reduced from ten days
to five business days and that the filing person be prohibited from acquiring additional securities until the filing was
made. See Statement of David S. Ruder, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Before the House
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, Sept. 17, 1987; Statement of Charles C. Cox, Acting Chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs,
June 23, 1987 (“[The] Commission could also support legislation to require that a Schedule 13D be filed within five
business days of crossing the 5 percent threshold, and that a prohibition on further purchases be imposed until the
filing requirement is satisfied.”).
29 See supra note 20 and accompanying text; see also 113 CONG. REC. 24,664 (1967) (noting that “takeover bids
should not be discouraged, since they often serve a useful purpose by providing a check on entrenched but
inefficient management”) (statement of Sen. Harrison A. Williams, Jr.).
30 Academic research indicates that large blockholders may improve the share price and the corporate governance of
the companies in which they invest, and these benefits are enjoyed by all of the company’s shareholders. See infra
Section III.C.b.i. This research also suggests that if the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline is shortened, it could
reduce the profitability of such investments to large blockholders, making them less inclined to make those
investments or engage with the companies in ways that produce such share price and corporate governance benefits.

many Schedule 13D filers currently do not avail themselves of the full 10-day filing period.31 In
recognition of the need to strike the appropriate balance between these interests, however, we
also solicit public comment on this point in Section III.F below.
As noted above, Rule 13d-1(a) currently requires the initial Schedule 13D to be filed
within 10 days after the date on which a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5%
of a covered class.32 We are proposing to amend Rule 13d-1(a) to require a Schedule 13D to be
filed within five days after the date of such acquisition. For purposes of determining the filing
deadline under this proposed amendment, the Commission must receive the filing on the fifth
day after the date of the acquisition in order for the filing to be considered timely. Under the
current rules, the Commission would have to receive that filing on or before 5:30 p.m. eastern
time on the due date.33 As described in Section II.A.6 below, however, we also are proposing to
extend that cut-off time to 10 p.m. eastern time for Schedule 13D and 13G filings, including

31 See infra notes 203-205 and accompanying text (noting that 22.97% of the initial Schedule 13D filings in the data
set were filed on the 10th day).
32 Failure to comply with this deadline, as well as other deadlines for beneficial ownership filings, could lead to
significant penalties. Under Section 21 of the Exchange Act, the Commission has the authority to investigate and
enforce violations of Section 13(d)(1) and Rule 13d-1(a), and may seek to impose various remedies for late filings,
such as injunctive relief, cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties. The Commission also may assert and
refer criminal violations for prosecutions under Section 32(a) of the Exchange Act. Importantly, no state of mind
requirement exists for violations of Section 13(d)(1) and corresponding Rule 13d-1(a). See SEC v. Levy, 706 F.
Supp. 61, 63-69 (D.D.C. 1989) (holding a defendant liable notwithstanding the defendant’s assertion that his
attorney “misinformed defendant about his obligation to disclose” information on Schedule 13D because scienter is
not an element of such violations). In addition, a Schedule 13D filing obligation is not dependent on the investor
intending to gain control of the company, but instead is based on a numerical beneficial ownership threshold. See
SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (“Indeed, the plain language of section 13(d)(1)
gives no hint that intentional conduct need be found, but rather, appears to place a simple and affirmative duty of
reporting on certain persons. The legislative history confirms that Congress was concerned with providing disclosure
to investors, and not merely with protecting them from fraudulent conduct.”); see also Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., 47
SEC 286, 1980 WL 26901, at *1-2 (May 19, 1980) (“We have previously held that the failure to make a required
report, even though inadvertent, constitutes a willful violation.”).
33 See Rule 13 of Regulation S-T, titled “Date of filing; adjustment of filing date.” 17 CFR 232.13. Rule 13(a)(2)
provides that “all filings submitted by direct transmission commencing on or before 5:30 p.m. [eastern time] shall be
deemed filed on the same business day, and all filings submitted by direct transmission commencing after 5:30 p.m.
[eastern time] shall be deemed filed as of the next business day.” Id.
21
amendments thereto.34
In proposing to establish new timeframes for filing reports, we are mindful of the need to
balance the market’s demand for timely information against the administrative burden placed
upon a filer to adequately and accurately prepare that information. We also recognize that when
enacting Section 13(d)(1), Congress considered the interests of both issuers of securities and the
large shareholders who sought to exert influence or control over issuers, and took an evenhanded approach.35 The proposed five-day deadline reflects our attempt to maintain that balance
and similarly undertake an even-handed approach, especially when compared with considerably
shorter initial filing deadlines some parties have recommended. 36 However, in light of the
technological advances and the rapid pace with which trading activities and large accumulations
of beneficial ownership can occur in the financial markets today as compared to when the
deadline was enacted in 1968, we are concerned that the current delay in reporting marketmoving information on Schedule 13D raises investor protection concerns. 37 Under current Rule

34 See infra Section II.A.6.
35 In discussing the Williams Act, one Senator stated that “the committee has carefully weighed both the advantages
and disadvantages to the public of the cash tender offer. We have taken extreme care to avoid tipping the scales
either in favor of management or in favor of the person making the takeover bids. S. 510 is designed solely to
require full and fair disclosure for the benefit of investors.” 113 CONG. REC. S12557 (daily ed. Aug. 30, 1967)
(statement of Sen. Harrison A. Williams, Jr.). The Senator further stated that “[t]he bill will at the same time
provide the offeror and management with equal opportunity to present their case.” Id.; see also Full Disclosure of
Corporate Equity Ownership and in Corporate Takeover Bids: Hearing on S. 510 Before the Subcomm. on
Securities of the S. Comm. on Banking and Currency, 90th Cong. 1 (1967) (statement of Manuel F. Cohen,
Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission) (“But the principal point is that we are not concerned with
assisting or hurting either side. We are concerned with the investor who today is just a pawn in a form of industrial
warfare.”).
36 See, e.g., supra note 17.
37 The Commission has long recognized that additional purchases made after a filing obligation arises under Section
13(d)(1) and corresponding Rule 13d-1(a) constitutes a “disclosure gap [that] may deprive security holders of a fair
opportunity to adjust their evaluation of the securities of a company with respect to [a] potential change in control . .
. .” Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements pursuant
to Section 13(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (June 27, 1980); see also supra note 17. Following a review
of the effectiveness of Section 13(d) conducted more than four decades ago, the Commission evaluated the then
“increasingly prevalent practice of [large blockholders] acquiring additional securities of [a covered] class during
22
13d-1(a), large shareholders may acquire more shares without contemporaneously disclosing
their beneficial ownership during the 10-day period that follows the date that a Schedule 13D
filing obligation arises. Although the 10-day period may facilitate opportunities for certain
shareholders to acquire stakes large enough to incentivize them to engage in corporate activism
that could benefit all shareholders, 38 the informational imbalance between a buyer and seller
during that period may result in transactions being consummated based on mispriced securities.39
Congress enacted Section 13(d) as a means of requiring timely disclosures needed for
informed investment decisions that ultimately could contribute to the accurate valuation of
securities.
40 The proposed shortening of the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline is consistent
with those legislative objectives while holding the potential to benefit investors and improve the
efficiency of U.S. capital markets. Market-moving information, such as the accumulation of a
significant equity stake,41 would be made available more quickly, improving opportunities for
more efficient and more accurate price discovery. 42 In addition to more closely aligning the

system often does not provide shareholders with relevant information in a timely manner.” Id.
38 See supra notes 17 and 19.
39 HR. Rep. 90-1711 (1968) (“But where no information is available about persons seeking control, or their plans,
the shareholder is forced to make a decision on the basis of a market price which reflects evaluation of the company

40 See GAF Corp. v. Milstein, 453 F.2d 709, 717 (2d. Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 910 (1972) (noting that
without prompt disclosure, “investors cannot assess the potential for changes in corporate control and adequately
evaluate the company’s worth”).

price changes occur in response to news about changes in corporate control, including the filing of a Schedule 13D.

deadlines for similar beneficial ownership reports in foreign jurisdictions.43 The increase in
transparency and corresponding assurance given to investors that transactions are not being made
based on mispriced securities caused by a prolonged lag in the dissemination of market-moving
information should increase investor confidence. By increasing the certainty offered to
shareholders that their trades are not being made on the basis of incomplete or outdated
information, the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(a) could in turn enhance market efficiency
and liquidity.

1. Should we amend Rule 13d-1(a) as proposed?

shareholders to accept a tender offer is the adequacy of the price. But, I might ask, how can an investor evaluate the
adequacy of the price if he cannot assess the possible impact of a change in control? Certainly without such
information he cannot judge its adequacy by the current or recent market price. That price presumably reflects the
assumption that the company’s present business, control and management will continue. If that assumption is
changed, is it not likely that the market price might change?”). The potential gains in market efficiency and price
discovery that could be achieved with a shorter initial reporting deadline, however, could be offset by the costs
imposed upon shareholders who seek to influence or change management. See supra note 38 and accompanying
text.
43 For example, Australia requires disclosure of any position of 5% or more within two business days if any
transaction affects or is likely to affect control or potential control of the issuer. See Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)
sec. 671B (Austl.). The United Kingdom imposes a two-trading-day deadline for disclosure of acquisitions in
excess of 3% of an issuer’s securities. See Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules, Ch. 5 (U.K.). Germany
requires a report “immediately,” but in no event later than four days after crossing the acquisition threshold. See
Securities Trading Act, Sept. 9, 1998, BGBL. I at 2708, as amended, pt. 5 (Ger.). Hong Kong securities laws
require a report within three business days of the acquisition of a “notifiable interest” under the law. See Part XV of
the Securities and Futures Ordinance (promulgated by the Securities and Futures Commission, effective Apr. 1,
2003) (H.K.). This comparative analysis suggests that a shortened deadline is workable based on the experience of
these foreign jurisdictions. We note, however, that this comparative analysis may be imperfect given the relevant
differences in the legal systems in the U.S. and these foreign jurisdictions, including anti-takeover devices that are
legal under certain states’ corporate laws (e.g., low-threshold poison pills that are permitted under Delaware law)
that may not be legal in these foreign jurisdictions.
24
2. How has the market for corporate control changed since the enactment of the Williams
Act? To the extent those changes are significant, how should we consider them in our
analysis of shortening the reporting window?
3. Should we amend Rule 13d-1(a), but have the initial Schedule 13D due within a different
number of days than proposed (e.g., five business days rather than five days) after the date
of acquisition? Should we use business days instead of days for purposes of the Rule 13d1(a) deadline for the initial Schedule 13D filing?
4. Rather than shorten the deadline under Rule 13d-1(a) in all instances, should we offer a
tiered approach, such as maintaining the 10-day deadline for acquisitions of greater than
5% but no more than 10% while instituting a shorter deadline if beneficial ownership
exceeds 10%? Should a person who “stands still” (i.e., chooses to make no further
acquisitions of beneficial ownership) after crossing the 5% threshold be subject to a longer
filing deadline than those persons who continue to make acquisitions after crossing the 5%
threshold? If so, how much extra time to file should such person be given? In addition, if
a tiered deadline is recommended, should any limit be placed upon the amount that can be
acquired during the day on which the 5% threshold is crossed? If any acquisition limits
should be imposed on the day the 5% threshold is crossed under a scenario where we
move to adopt tiered deadlines, what should be the maximum amount that a person could
acquire and still be eligible for an extended filing deadline?
5. Should the deadline for the initial Schedule 13D filing vary based on a particular
characteristic of the issuer (such as its market capitalization or trading volume)? If so,
please explain the justification for why the deadline for reporting beneficial ownership in
certain types of issuers should be either shorter or longer based on any such characteristic.
6. Would the costs associated with preparing and filing an initial Schedule 13D within the
proposed five-day deadline substantially differ from current costs of filing, and if so, why?
25
7. Would the proposed amendments improve price discovery of a covered class, and, in turn,
reinforce investors’ confidence in the integrity of the capital markets?
8. Are there costs other than routine filing and preparation costs that we should consider in
setting the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline, and if so, what are those costs and can
they be quantified? For example, would shortening the deadline necessarily limit the
amount of a covered class that a beneficial owner could acquire before the initial Schedule
13D filing is due? If so, please identify such limit or limitations. To the extent that any
limit or limitations exist on the amount of beneficial ownership in a covered class that can
be acquired on the same day on which the 5% reporting threshold is crossed, how would
any such limit or limitations impose actual or anticipated costs upon shareholders in the
covered class, including those who would be acquiring reportable positions for the first
time?
9. Other than administrative burden or liquidity concerns, what other potential drawbacks
should be considered in setting a new filing deadline? For example, would there be
observable decreases in shareholder activism?
10. As a means of offsetting any incremental cost increases associated with the proposed
change, should we amend Schedule 13D, codified at Rule 13d-101, to include prepopulated disclosure fields under each line item disclosure requirement that reduce the
amount of narrative that the filer would be required to prepare and review? For example,
rather than requiring filers to describe any plans or proposals that would result in the
issuer undertaking an extraordinary transaction (e.g., a sale or transfer of a material
amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries), such a transaction type would be
listed along with a box that could be “checked” by the filer to indicate the existence of any
plan or proposal for the issuer to engage in such a transaction.
26
11. Have any change of control transactions followed large accumulations of beneficial
ownership that occurred after the 5% threshold was crossed but before the initial Schedule
13D was filed, and if so, what were those transactions?
12. Is there evidence of shareholder harm that occurred as a result of purchases made by a
large shareholder after the 5% threshold was crossed but before the Schedule 13D was
filed? If so, please describe the impact of such accumulations (including any quantifiable
harms).
13. Have any corporate actions been prevented from occurring, or been forced to occur, as a
result of the current 10-day filing deadline for an initial Schedule 13D? If so, what were
those instances and how did the delay in reporting interfere with or otherwise impact the
normal operation of the corporation? For example, were any issuers coerced or pressured
to execute a settlement agreement or undertake a buyback of their securities as a direct
consequence of the initially undisclosed amount of a covered class acquired once the 5%
threshold was crossed? Aside from transactions that occur based upon an imbalance of
information, are there any other specific difficulties that arise from information
asymmetries in the days leading up to a Schedule 13D filing?
14. Shares purchased during the 10-day window in advance of a Schedule 13D filing are
purchased from shareholders who already have made the decision to exit or reduce their
investment. It is possible that some or all of those shareholders would have sold their
shares regardless of whether a Schedule 13D had been filed earlier. Is there evidence that
a Schedule 13D filing impacts the liquidity of an issuer’s shares or otherwise indicates that
a Schedule 13D filing impacts shareholders’ decisions to sell their shares?
2. Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g)
a. Background
27
Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) were adopted in 1998.44 Those rules are designed to ensure
that initial Schedule 13D filing obligations are identical, regardless of whether the beneficial
owners were previously eligible to file a Schedule 13G in lieu of the Schedule 13D. Specifically,
Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) set forth the initial Schedule 13D filing obligations for investors who
are no longer eligible to rely upon Rule 13d-1(b)45 or (c).
46 Rules 13d-1(b) and (c) permit
investors to file a comparatively abbreviated Schedule 13G in lieu of the longer-form Schedule
13D and to have more time to make amended filings.
Rule 13d-1(e) applies to persons who have been filing a Schedule 13G in lieu of
Schedule 13D in reliance upon either Rule 13d-1(b) or (c). Rules 13d-1(b) and (c) both provide
that a person may not rely on those provisions if he or she beneficially owns the relevant equity
securities with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer.
Institutional and non-institutional beneficial owners who are unable to certify that they do not
hold beneficial ownership with the intent to change or influence control of the issuer or in
connection with any transaction that would have such purpose or effect, as described more fully
under Item 10 of Schedule 13G, or certain institutional investors that also acquire or hold
beneficial ownership outside of the ordinary course of business are considered to have, for
purposes of this release, a “disqualifying purpose or effect.”47 Rule 13d-1(e)(1) currently

44 Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements, Release No. 34-39538 (Jan. 12, 1998) [63 FR
2854 (Jan. 16, 1998)].
45 17 CFR 240.13d-1(b).
46 17 CFR 240.13d-1(c).
47 Whether investors are engaged in activity with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of an
issuer, and thus holding beneficial ownership with a disqualifying purpose or effect, ordinarily is a determination
that would be based upon the specific facts and circumstances. For that reason, the Commission has not provided
extensive guidance on this issue. The Commission has previously opined that most solicitations in support of a
proposal specifically calling for a change of control of the company (e.g., a proposal to seek a buyer for the
company or a contested election of directors or a sale of a significant amount of assets or a restructuring of a
corporation) would clearly have that purpose and effect. For a more expansive discussion of the Commission’s
reasoning and factors to consider when making this determination, see Amendments to Beneficial Ownership
Reporting Requirements, Release No. 34-39538 (Jan. 12, 1998) [63 FR 2854 (Jan. 16, 1998)].
28
requires that such persons file their initial Schedule 13D within 10 days of losing their Schedule
13G eligibility because they beneficially own a covered class with a disqualifying purpose or
effect.
Similarly, Rule 13d-1(f) applies to persons who have been filing a Schedule 13G in lieu
of Schedule 13D in reliance on Rule 13d-1(c). Rule 13d-1(c) provides that persons may not rely
on that provision if they beneficially own 20% or more of a covered class. Rule 13d-1(f)(1)
currently requires that such persons file their initial Schedule 13D within 10 days of losing their
Schedule 13G eligibility because they beneficially own 20% or more of a covered class.
Finally, Rule 13d-1(g) applies to persons who have been filing a Schedule 13G in lieu of
Schedule 13D in reliance upon Rule 13d-1(b). Only QIIs may rely on Rule 13d-1(b). Further, in
order to rely on Rule 13d-1(b), a QII must beneficially own the relevant equity securities in the
ordinary course of its business. Rule 13d-1(g) currently requires that such persons either file
their initial Schedule 13D or amend their Schedule 13G to indicate that they are now relying on
Rule 13d-1(c) (assuming they are eligible to rely on that rule) within 10 days of losing their
Schedule 13G eligibility under Rule 13d-1(b) because they either no longer are a QII or no
longer beneficially own the relevant equity securities in the ordinary course of their business.
Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) operate as regulatory safeguards that reestablish the
application of Rule 13d-1(a) to beneficial owners who previously relied on Rule 13d-1(b) or (c)
to indefinitely suspend application of Rule 13d-1(a) and its attendant 10-day initial Schedule
13D filing deadline. Under Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g), beneficial owners “shall immediately
become subject to” Rules 13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a), which provisions are reinstated anew with
respect to those persons the moment they become ineligible to rely upon Rules 13d-1(b) and (c).
Due to the importance of Schedule 13D’s disclosure requirements and the regulatory purposes
served by the timely dissemination of that material information, we have preliminarily concluded
that no compelling reason exists to treat persons who become ineligible to file on Schedule 13G
29
differently from persons who initially have no option other than to file on Schedule 13D.
b. Proposed Amendments
For largely the same reasons that we are proposing to amend Rule 13d-1(a) to shorten the
initial Schedule 13D filing deadline thereunder, we also are proposing to amend the initial
Schedule 13D filing deadline under Rules 13d-1(e)(1), (f)(1), and (g). Specifically, we are
proposing to make conforming revisions to Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) so that the Schedule 13D
required to be filed by persons who initially elected to report beneficial ownership on Schedule
13G but subsequently lost their eligibility are treated no differently from persons who make a
Schedule 13D their initial filing. Accordingly, we propose to amend Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g)
to make the required Schedule 13D—or, in the case of Rule 13d-1(g), the amendment to
Schedule 13G indicating that the filer is now relying on Rule 13d-1(c), if applicable—due no
later than five days after the date on which the person became ineligible to report on Schedule
13G.
Request for Comment
15. Given the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(a), should we make conforming changes to
Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) as proposed?
16. Should we amend Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) but have the initial Schedule 13D due within
a different number of days than proposed (e.g., five business days rather than five days)?
Should we use business days instead of days for purposes of the deadlines in Rules 13d1(e), (f), and (g)?
17. Are there any reasons why Schedule 13G filers submitting an initial Schedule 13D
pursuant to Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) should be required to file on a different timetable
from those investors who file an initial Schedule 13D pursuant to the deadline in the
proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(a)?
30
18. Rather than make conforming changes to Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g), should the
Commission rescind Schedule 13G and rely on Section 13(g)(5) of the Exchange Act to
consolidate beneficial ownership reporting on a single form, Schedule 13D, with different
disclosure requirements applicable to beneficial owners who can certify that they did not
acquire and do not hold the beneficial ownership with a disqualifying purpose or effect?
19. With respect to the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(g), if a filer who is no longer
eligible to rely on Rule 13d-1(b) may instead rely on Rule 13d-1(c), should the deadline
for filing an amended Schedule 13G in this instance differ from the deadline for filing an
initial Schedule 13D pursuant to Rule 13d-1(g) given that the filer would continue to be
able to certify that it does not hold beneficial ownership with a disqualifying purpose or
effect? Would five business days after the month-end in which such change occurred be
appropriate and consistent with our proposed change to Rule 13d-2(b)?
3. Rules 13d-1(b), (c), and (d)
a. Background
Section 13(g) was added to the Exchange Act in 1977.48 Congress enacted Section 13(g)
to address the absence of beneficial ownership reporting by persons who had accumulated large
amounts of stock in a public issuer but who were not required to file a beneficial ownership
report under Section 13(d).49 Section 13(g) was intended to “supplement the current statutory
scheme by providing legislative authority for certain additional disclosure requirements that in
some cases could not be imposed administratively.”50 Beneficial owners who currently report on
Schedule 13G pursuant to Section 13(g) and corresponding Rule 13d-1(d) are not subject to

48 Domestic and Foreign Investment Improved Disclosure Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95‐214, sec. 203, 91. Stat. 1494.
49 S. Rep. No. 114, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 13 (1977).
50 S. Rep. No. 95-114, at 13 (1977), reprinted in 1977 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News. 4098, 4111.

Section 13(d) because they either made an exempt acquisition or an acquisition otherwise not
covered by the statute. Section 13(d), in contrast to Section 13(g), applies only to beneficial
owners who make non-exempt acquisitions of more than 5% of a covered class. Section 13(g)
was intended to close this gap.
In response to the enactment of Section 13(g), the Commission adopted Schedule 13G to
serve two purposes: (1) provide an optional short form disclosure statement for certain persons
subject to Section 13(d); and (2) provide a mandatory disclosure statement for persons subject to
Section 13(g).51 Together with Section 13(d), Section 13(g) was intended to provide a
“comprehensive disclosure system of corporate ownership” applicable to all persons who are the
beneficial owners of more than 5% of a covered class.52
The deadline for the initial Schedule 13G filing depends on whether the person is a QII,
Exempt Investor or Passive Investor. Rule 13d-1(b) currently provides that a QII must file an
initial Schedule 13G only if such QII beneficially owns more than 5% of a covered class at the
end of a calendar year.53 A person relying upon Rule 13d-1(b) is obligated under current Rule
13d-1(b)(2) to file a Schedule 13G “within 45 days after the end of the calendar year in which

52 Id. at 18486; see also Senate Report No. 114, 95th Cong. lst Sess. 14 (1977).
53 First adopted as Rule 13d-5 in 1977 and subsequently redesignated as Rule 13d-1(b)(1) in 1978, the predecessor
to current Rule 13d-1(b)(2) established that an institution eligible to report on the newly adopted Schedule 13G had
until 45 days after the end of the calendar year to report beneficial ownership to the extent the amount held exceeded
5% at the end of the last day of the calendar year. See Filing and Disclosure Requirements Relating to Beneficial
Ownership, Release No. 34-14692 (Apr. 21, 1978) [43 FR 18484 at 18486 (Apr. 28, 1978)] (explaining that “the
first provision in new Rule 13d-1(b) has been added to make clear that the obligation to file a Schedule 13G need be
determined only on the last day of the calendar year” and that “filing [a] Schedule 13G to disclose a beneficial
ownership interest of more than five but not more than ten percent will be required forty-five days after the end of
the calendar year”); see also Adoption of Beneficial Ownership Disclosure Requirements, Release No. 34-13291
(Feb. 24, 1977) [42 FR 12342 (Mar. 3, 1977)] (describing the Commission’s adoption of new Rule 13d-5 and related
new Form 13D-5, which permitted brokers, dealers, banks, investment companies, investment advisers, and
employee benefit plans to utilize an abbreviated disclosure notice).
32
the person became obligated” to report beneficial ownership. If the QII beneficially owns more
than 10% of a covered class as of the last day of any month, then the initial Schedule 13G must
be filed within 10 days after the end of that month. A QII relying on Rule 13d-1(b), therefore,
may have beneficial ownership in excess of 5% during the calendar year without incurring a
filing obligation unless the QII beneficially owns more than 10% of a covered class at the end of
any month during the calendar year.
Rule 13d-1(d),
54 as with Rule 13d-1(b), imposes an initial Schedule 13G filing deadline
of 45 days after the end of the calendar year, but only for investors who have become beneficial
owners without having made an acquisition recognized under Section 13(d)(1). Given that these
investors did not make the requisite acquisition that would have subjected them to Section 13(d),
the Commission has previously referred to this type of beneficial owner as an “Exempt
Investor.” Unlike the QIIs and Passive Investors—discussed below, in the context of Rule 13d1(c)—who file a Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule 13D and at all times remain subject to Section
13(d), Exempt Investors are subject to Section 13(g) at the time their initial filing obligation
arises. Exempt Investors reporting pursuant to Rule 13d-1(d) today may include persons such as
founders of companies and early investors in an issuer’s class of equity securities who made their
acquisition before the class was registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.55 These
beneficial owners may continue to influence or control the issuer. Accordingly, the Commission

54 17 CFR 240.13d-1(d).
55 The Commission has explained that certain “persons who are not required to file under Rule 13d-1(a) . . . would
be required to file a Schedule 13G pursuant to the amendments herein proposed.” Filing and Disclosure
Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Release No. 34-14693 (Apr. 21, 1978) [43 FR 18501 at 18502
(Apr. 28, 1978)]. Such persons may include “persons who acquired not more than two percent of a class of
securities within a twelve month period, who are exempt from Rule 13d-1(a) by Section 13(d)(6)(B).” Id. The
Commission also stated that “Regulation 13D-G . . . would require any person ‘otherwise’ not required to report
pursuant to Section 13(d), but who is a beneficial owner of more than five percent of a specified class of equity
securities to report on Schedule 13G.” Id.
33
has emphasized that the disclosures required under Section 13(g) are obtained in connection with
the overall regulatory purposes served by Section 13(d).56
Finally, Rule 13d-1(c) was adopted by the Commission on January 12, 1998.
57 The
rulemaking created a new class of investor, commonly referred to as “Passive Investors,” eligible
to report on a Schedule 13G in lieu of the Schedule 13D that is otherwise required to be filed
given that the person has made an acquisition subject to Section 13(d). Passive Investors are
required under current Rule 13d-1(c) to file a Schedule 13G within 10 days after acquiring
beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a covered class. Passive Investors electing to report on
Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule 13D are required under current Rule 13d-1(c) to file within 10
days after acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a covered class. A person is only
eligible to file on Schedule 13G under Rule 13d-1(c) if such person is not seeking to acquire or
influence control of an issuer and beneficially owns less than 20% of a covered class. Persons
unable or unwilling to certify under Item 10 of Schedule 13G that they do not have a
disqualifying purpose or effect because, for example, the possibility exists that they may seek to
exercise or influence control, are ineligible to file a Schedule 13G and must instead file a
Schedule 13D.
b. Proposed Amendments
We believe that the current initial Schedule 13G filing deadlines for all three types of
Schedule 13G filers warrant reassessment. The current initial Schedule 13G filing deadlines’

56 Filing and Disclosure Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Release No. 34-14692 (Apr. 21, 1978) [43
FR 18484 at 18486 (Apr. 28, 1978)] (stating that “the enactment of [S]ection 13(g) has rendered moot the issue of
whether obtaining” disclosure from institutional investors in the ordinary course of their business and without any
control intent “under [S]ection 13(d)(5) is within the primary purpose of [S]ection 13(d)”). The Commission also
emphasized “the importance of disclosing to the public the location of rapidly accumulated blocks of stock, even
though they have been acquired not with the purpose or with the effect of changing or influencing control” as a
predicate for its position. Id.

2854 (Jan. 16, 1998)].
34
length and manner of applicability to QIIs and Exempt Investors together could, in certain
circumstances, frustrate the purposes of Section 13(d) and Section 13(g). Investors reporting
pursuant to current Rules 13d-1(b) and (d) may avoid beneficial ownership reporting by selling
down their positions before the end of the calendar year, and, in the case of QIIs, selling down
before the end of a month if ownership exceeds 10%. Amendments to the filing deadlines for
initial Schedule 13G submissions required to be made by QIIs and Exempt Investors may
therefore be needed to improve transparency consistent with the intent of Congress when
enacting Section 13(d) and Section 13(g). The existing deadlines and manner of applicability not
only could give rise to a gap in reporting for persons who possess the potential to change control
of an issuer—or, in the case of Exempt Investors, may already control an issuer—but also risk
devaluing the importance of the disclosures when made, if made at all. 58 The very gap in
reporting that Congress sought to close by enacting Section 13(g) may now be effectively just as
wide given that large, undisclosed accumulations could be occurring and may be reported
considerably later than is useful to investors and the market, if reported at all. 59

58 See infra note 221 and accompanying text (noting the importance to the market of information regarding
beneficial ownership, regardless whether it is disclosed on Schedule 13D or 13G, based on evidence that the initial
filing of Schedule 13G, like that of Schedule 13D, generates a positive stock price reaction, albeit smaller in
magnitude).
59 See, e.g., Kristin Giglia, A Little Letter, a Big Difference: An Empirical Inquiry into Possible Misuse of Schedule
13G/13D Filings, 116 COLUM. L. REV. 105, 115-16 (2015) (explaining that the availability of Schedule 13G may
allow investors to “intentionally structure their acquisition strategies to exploit the gaps created by the current
reporting regime, to their own short-term benefit and to the overall detriment of market transparency and investor
confidence” (internal quotations omitted)); In the Matter of Perry Corp., Release No. 34-60351 (July 21, 2009)
(illustrating how an institutional investor improperly relied upon Rule 13d-1(b) to defer reporting its beneficial
ownership of nearly 10% of a covered class). QIIs in particular may be able to amass sizeable amounts of beneficial
ownership without reporting such positions. Rule 13d-1(b)(2) provides in relevant part that “it shall not be
necessary to file a Schedule 13G unless the percentage of [a covered class] beneficially owned as of the end of the
calendar year is more than five percent.” As such, a QII may beneficially own in excess of 5% of a covered class for
the entire year, sell down its position to 5% or below on the last day of the calendar year and bypass having to report
at all under the current regulatory framework assuming that its beneficial ownership continues to be held in the
ordinary course of business, without a disqualifying purpose or effect, and does not exceed 10% of a covered class.
35
In addition, at the time Rule 13d-1(c) was first adopted, Passive Investors may not have
had reasonable access to advanced technologies to make more immediate filings possible.
Consistent with our justification for proposing to shorten the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline
under Rule 13d-1(a), we believe Passive Investors today not only have gained valuable
experience complying with these reporting provisions, but also have ready access to the
necessary filing technology. As such, while the 10-day filing deadline in Rule 13d-1(c) may
have been appropriate in 1998, technological advancements in the intervening two decades, as
well as our proposed amendment to the analogous filing deadline in Rule 13d-1(a), support a
reconsideration and recalibration of that deadline.
Accordingly, we propose to amend Rules 13d-1(b) and (d) to shorten the filing deadline
for the initial Schedule 13G to be filed by QIIs and Exempt Investors to five business days 60 after
the end of the month in which beneficial ownership exceeds 5% of a covered class. The
proposed acceleration of these deadlines is expected to result in more timely disclosures while
minimizing any additional burdens. We believe that these investors should already have wellestablished compliance systems in place to monitor Schedule 13G ownership levels to determine
whether filing obligations have been triggered. For example, compliance operations at QIIs
currently need to monitor beneficial ownership levels at least on a monthly basis in case their

60 Our proposed definition of “business day” would be consistent with how that term is defined under other rule
provisions adopted under the Exchange Act, such as 17 CFR 240.14d-1 (“Rule 14d-1(g)(3)”), which defines the
term “business day” to mean “any day, other than Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, and shall consist of the
time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight Eastern time.” Unlike Rule 14d-1(g), which defines the term
for purposes of Regulations 14D and 14E, the proposed amendments to Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 that use the term
“business day” are indifferent as to whether or not the date of the event that triggers a Schedule 13D or Schedule
13G filing obligation falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday versus a business day. For example, under the
proposed amendments to Rules 13d-1(b) and (d), the initial Schedule 13G would be due the fifth business day after
the last day of the month in which beneficial ownership exceeds 5% of a covered class. In addition, as stated at the
outset of Regulation 13D-G, Regulation S-T governs the preparation and submissions of filings in electronic format
and should be read in conjunction with the rules contained within Regulation 13D-G, including Rules 13d-1 and
13d-2.
36
holdings exceed more than 10% at the end of the month and trigger an initial Schedule 13G
filing pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(2). Similarly, Exempt Investors already need to monitor the
level of their beneficial ownership continuously or periodically to ensure that the amount of their
beneficial ownership does not unintentionally exceed 2% in a 12-month period and trigger
application of Section 13(d).61
Given the proposal to shorten the initial reporting deadline to five business days after the
end of the month, the current provision of Rule 13d-1(b)(2) that operates to accelerate that initial
filing deadline if beneficial ownership exceeds 10% at the end of any month would be
unnecessary in light of Rule 13d-2(c)’s overlapping Schedule 13G amendment requirement.62
Accordingly, we propose to further amend Rule 13d-1(b)(2) to delete the language that imposes
an initial reporting obligation on QIIs after exceeding 10% of a covered class.
We also are proposing to amend the filing deadline in Rule 13d-1(c) to five days after the
date the person becomes obligated to file an initial Schedule 13G and amendment thereto,
respectively, under those two provisions. We believe it is appropriate to amend the initial
Schedule 13G filing deadline in Rule 13d-1(c) to match the proposed initial Schedule 13D filing
deadline in Rule 13d-1(a) in order to maintain the historical regulatory consistency between the
deadlines in Rules 13d-1(c) and (a) and to facilitate the overall goal of increasing transparency in
beneficial ownership.
Request for Comment

61 Exempt Investors can jeopardize their eligibility to report on Schedule 13G by voluntarily or involuntarily making
an acquisition, or acquisitions, by purchase or otherwise as determined under Rule 13d-5(a), that exceed(s) 2% of a
covered class in a consecutive 12-month period and thus render unavailable the Section 13(d)(6)(B) exemption.
62 Specifically, current Rule 13d-2(c) would still require QIIs to file an amendment to their Schedule 13G within 10
days after the end of the first month in which their beneficial ownership exceeds 10% of a covered class, calculated
as of the last day of the month. If the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-2(c) is adopted, however, QIIs would be
required to make such disclosure within five days after the date on which the person’s direct or indirect beneficial
ownership exceeds 10%.
37
20. Should we amend Rules 13d-1(b), (c), and (d) as proposed?
21. Should we amend Rules 13d-1(b) and (d) but require a different deadline for an initial
Schedule 13G filing than we proposed? For example, should we require a shorter or
longer deadline than our proposed deadline of within five business days after the end of
the month in which beneficial ownership exceeded 5% in a covered class? Alternatively,
should the deadline be expressed in days rather than business days to conform to the
proposed deadlines in Rules 13d-1(a), (e), (f), and (g)?
22. Do costs other than routine filing and preparation costs exist that we should consider in
setting the initial Schedule 13G filing deadlines? If any such costs exist, please identify
and quantify to the extent practicable. For example, would shorter deadlines inhibit
beneficial owners’ opportunities to verify the number of outstanding securities of a
covered class for purposes of determining whether their beneficial ownership exceeds 5%?
Such verification could include any internal processes that a beneficial owner may have in
place to independently corroborate the accuracy of the number of shares disclosed in an
issuer’s most recent annual, quarterly or current report notwithstanding the absence of
such an affirmative obligation under Rule 13d-1(j).63
23. Our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(b)(2) would only require QIIs to determine the
amount of their beneficial ownership as of the last day of a month for purposes of their
initial Schedule 13G filing obligation under that rule. Should QIIs be required to
determine the amount of their beneficial ownership as of any day during a month rather
than only as of the last day of a month, and if so, what practical challenges or other
burdens are associated with monitoring the level of beneficial ownership on a daily basis?

63 Rule 13d-1(j) provides that a beneficial owner may rely upon information in an issuer’s most recent periodic or
current report unless the beneficial owner knows or has reason to believe that the information contained in the report
is inaccurate. 17 CFR 240.13d-1(j).
38
24. Should we treat the initial Schedule 13G reporting deadline applicable to QIIs differently
from the deadline applicable to Exempt Investors, and if so, why? For example, would
any “front running” concerns exist with the proposed amendments for reporting deadlines
applicable to QIIs?
25. Section 13(g)(5) requires the Commission to “achieve centralized reporting of information
regarding ownership” and “avoid unnecessarily duplicative reporting.” As a means of
pursuing these goals, should the Commission eliminate Schedule 13G and consolidate
beneficial ownership reporting into one form, Schedule 13D? Under this alternative,
beneficial owners that previously would have been eligible to report on Schedule 13G
could, for example, be required to satisfy less burdensome disclosure requirements on a
new, consolidated form.
26. Although Passive Investors certify that they did not acquire and do not hold beneficial
ownership with a disqualifying purpose or effect, they are currently required to file their
initial Schedule 13G by the same deadline as Schedule 13D filers. If we adopt our
proposed amendment to the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline under Rule 13d-1(a), are
there any reasons why we should not make a corresponding change to the initial Schedule
13G filing deadline under Rule 13d-1(c) given that the same technological advancements
equally enable Passive Investors to make a Schedule 13G filing on an accelerated basis?
4. Rules 13d-2(a) and (b)
a. Background
Section 13(d)(2) requires that an amendment must be filed to the statement required
under Section 13(d)(1) if any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement filed,
but does not identify a specific deadline by which such amendment must be filed. Instead, Rule
39
13d-2(a) provides, as its predecessor Rule 13d-2 did when first adopted in 1968,64 that such
amendment must be filed with the Commission “promptly.”65 The initial adopting release did
not provide an explanation as to why “promptly,” as opposed to a specified deadline, was
chosen. As a factual matter, the “promptly” standard may, under certain conditions, allow for
more time to report a complex disclosure issue or material development based on an involuntary
change in circumstances that nevertheless triggers an amendment obligation. The obligation to
file an amendment under current Rule 13d-2(a) is not limited to acquisitions. Instead, changes in
the disclosure narrative that are material also have to be reported in an amendment, as do
material changes in the level of beneficial ownership caused by an involuntary change in
circumstances, such as a reduction in the amount of beneficial ownership caused solely by an
increase in the number of shares outstanding. 66
Section 13(g)(2) requires that an amendment be filed to the statement required under
Section 13(g)(1) if any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement filed, but like
Section 13(d)(2), does not identify a deadline by which such amendment must be filed. Rule
13d-2(b), however, does specify a deadline and provides that for all persons who report
beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, an amendment shall be filed “within forty-five days after
the end of each calendar year if, as of the end of the calendar year, there are any changes in the
information reported in the previous filing on that Schedule [13G].”
b. Proposed Amendments

1968)].
65 17 CFR 240.13d-2(a).
66 See id. (requiring an amendment “[i]f any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the Schedule 13D”
including “any material increase or decrease in the percentage of the class beneficially owned”).
40
We propose to amend Rule 13d-2(a) to require that all amendments to Schedule 13D be
filed within one business day after the material change that triggers the amendment obligation.
This change from the current “promptly” standard would establish a specified filing deadline,
remove any uncertainty as to the date on which an amendment is due and help ensure that
beneficial owners amend their filings in a more uniform and consistent manner. In light of the
technological advances discussed in Section II.A.1 above, and for many of the same reasons we
are proposing to shorten the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline, we do not believe that requiring
Schedule 13D amendments to be filed within one business day after the date on which a material
change occurs will place those filers at a disadvantage.67 Further, because an amendment to a
Schedule 13D only requires that the material change be reported and not a complete set of new
narrative responses to each of the disclosure form’s individual line items,68 those amendments
should present a lower administrative burden than the initial Schedule 13D filing.
We also are proposing to amend Rule 13d-2(b) to require a Schedule 13G to be amended
within five business days of the end of the month in which a material change occurs in the
information previously reported. Accelerating the deadline for amendments from the current
standard of 45 days after the end of the calendar year would help ensure that the information
reported is timely and useful. In addition, this proposed deadline would be consistent with the
proposed five business day deadline from the end of the month applicable to QIIs’ and Exempt

67 Our proposed amendment also would be consistent with the Commission’s existing view that, under the current
“promptly” standard in Rule 13d-2(a), “[a]ny delay beyond the date the filing reasonably can be filed may not be
prompt” and that an amendment to a Schedule 13D reasonably could be filed in as little as one day following the
material change. In re Cooper Laboratories, Release No. 34-22171 (June 26, 1985).
68 Under Rule 13d-2(a), the Schedule 13D filer only has an obligation to “file or cause to be filed with the
Commission an amendment disclosing that [material] change.” See also 17 CFR 240.12b-15, titled “Amendments,”
which explains that “[a]mendments filed pursuant to this section must set forth the complete text of each item as
amended.”
41
Investors’ initial Schedule 13G filing obligations arising under Rules 13d-1(b) and (d). To
partially mitigate the time pressures resulting from the reduction of the current 45-day deadline
and the need to meet these new deadlines, if adopted, we have proposed a “business day”
standard in specifying the date on which the Schedule 13G filing would be due after an event
that triggers a reporting obligation.69
We further believe the text of Rule 13d-2(b) regarding the legal standard that triggers an
amendment obligation should be conformed to the statutory language. Sections 13(d)(2) and
13(g)(2) require such an amendment if a “material change” occurs to the facts in the statement
previously filed. Unlike Sections 13(d)(2) and 13(g)(2), Rule 13d-2(b) does not include an
express materiality qualifier for Schedule 13G amendments and simply requires an amendment
for “any change.” At the time Rule 13d-2(b) was adopted, however, the Commission stated that
there is a materiality standard inherent in the provisions governing Schedule 13G filings. This
inherent materiality standard is based on the fact that any disclosure provided by a Schedule 13G
filer, in light of the infrequency of the reports and comparatively minimal statements required to
be made, is effectively material. 70 Our proposed change would, therefore, merely codify this
view in the text of Rule 13d-2(b). As such, we are proposing to amend Rule 13d-2(b) to
substitute the term “material” in place of the term “any” to serve as the standard for determining
the type of change that will trigger an amendment obligation under Rule 13d-2(b).
Request for Comment
27. Should we amend Rules 13d-2(a) and (b) as proposed?

FR 18484 at 18489 (Apr. 28, 1978)] (stating the Commission’s belief that because “the information required by
Schedule 13G has been reduced to the minimum necessary to satisfy the statutory purpose, . . . a materiality standard
is inherent in those requirements” and “it is unnecessary to further minimize it by the insertion of an express
materiality standard”).
42
28. Should we amend the filing deadlines contained within Rules 13d-2(a) and (b) but specify
filing deadlines other than the ones which have been proposed? For example, should we
specify a filing deadline of two or three business days from the date of a material change
for Schedule 13D amendments and 10 or 15 business days from the end of the month in
which a material change occurs for Schedule 13G amendments? Instead of using
“business day” as the standard for calculating these filing deadlines, should we instead use
a certain number of days as we have proposed for revisions to Rules 13d-1(a), (c), (e)(1),
(f)(1), and (g) and 13d-2(c)? Should all reporting deadlines for Schedule 13D and
Schedule 13G filings be uniformly expressed in days, the standard in use now, or should
we express the filing deadlines uniformly in terms of business days?
29. Will the costs associated with preparing and filing an amended Schedule 13D or Schedule
13G within the proposed deadlines substantially differ from those costs now, and if so,
why?
30. Should we amend the filing deadline in Rule 13d-2(b) as proposed but instead retain the
rule text that requires a Schedule 13G amendment to be filed if “any change” exists in the
information previously reported, rather than a “material change,” as proposed? Under this
alternative, the changes reported would continue to be viewed as material disclosures
given their inherent materiality as the Commission described in the release adopting Rule
13d-2(b).71
5. Rules 13d-2(c) and (d)
a. Background
Rule 13d-2(c) governs the amendment obligation for QIIs whose beneficial ownership
exceeds 10% of a covered class. Under Rule 13d-2(c), QIIs are required to file an amendment to

71 See supra note 70 and accompanying text.
43
their Schedule 13G within 10 days after the end of the first month in which their beneficial
ownership exceeds 10% of a covered class, calculated as of the last day of the month. Once
across the 10% threshold, QIIs are further required under current Rule 13d-2(c) to file additional
amendments 10 days after the first month in which they increase or decrease their beneficial
ownership by more than 5% of the covered class, calculated as of the last day of the month.
Rule 13d-2(d) governs the amendment obligation for Passive Investors whose beneficial
ownership exceeds 10% of a covered class. Under current Rule 13d-2(d), Passive Investors are
required to “promptly” file an amendment to their Schedule 13G upon acquiring greater than
10% of a covered class. Once across the 10% threshold, Passive Investors are further required
under current Rule 13d-2(d) to file additional amendments “promptly” if they increase or
decrease their beneficial ownership by more than 5% of the covered class.
The amendment obligations arising under Rules 13d-2(c) and (d) are in addition to the
requirement in Rule 13d-2(b) that a Schedule 13G be amended within 45 days after each
calendar year end if, as of the end of the calendar year, any changes occur to the information
previously reported on the Schedule 13G. As such, Rules 13d-2(c) and (d) supplement the
amendment obligation under Rule 13d-2(b), which only arises if the person’s beneficial
ownership exceeds 5% of a covered class at the end of a calendar year. To comply with Rules
13d-2(c) and (d), QIIs and Passive Investors, depending on their beneficial ownership levels,
may have to amend their Schedule 13G filings more frequently and do so throughout the year.
b. Proposed Amendments
In connection with our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-2(b), we are proposing to
amend Rule 13d-2(c) to require that QIIs file an amendment to their Schedule 13G within five
days after the date on which their beneficial ownership exceeds 10% of a covered class, rather
than the current requirement of 10 days after the end of the month. Similarly, once across the
10% threshold, QIIs would be required to file additional amendments five days after the date on
44
which they increase or decrease their beneficial ownership by more than 5% of the covered class,
rather than the current requirement of 10 days after the end of the month. These amendments,
when considered in the context of our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-2(b), preserve the utility
of Rule 13d-2(c) as a provision that provides the market with earlier notice of QIIs’ beneficial
ownership exceeding 10% of a covered class and, thereafter, upon their beneficial ownership of
the covered class increasing or decreasing by more than 5%. We believe the imposition of such
an accelerated deadline is appropriate in the context of our proposed amendment to Rule 13d2(c) because the high thresholds in that rule—10% beneficial ownership of a covered class and
any subsequent 5% increase or decrease in beneficial ownership—warrant that the amendment
be rapidly disseminated to the market. Consistent with our rationale for proposing to shorten the
other deadlines, we believe QIIs have access to the same technology as other Schedule 13D and
13G filers to satisfy this deadline, especially given the size and sophistication of the persons
eligible to file as QIIs.
We also are proposing to amend Rule 13d-2(d) to change the amendment filing deadline
from the current “promptly” standard to one business day after the date on which an amendment
obligation arises. We are proposing to amend the “promptly” standard used in Rule 13d-2(d) for
substantially the same reasons we are proposing to shorten the filing deadline for the initial
Schedule 13G72 and change the filing deadline for Schedule 13D amendments.73
Request for Comment
31. Should we amend the filing deadlines in Rules 13d-2(c) and (d) as proposed?
32. Should we amend the filing deadlines in Rules 13d-2(c) and (d) but specify filing
deadlines other than those we have proposed? For example, should the deadline in Rule

72 See supra Section II.A.3.
73 See supra Section II.A.4.
45
13d-2(c) be expressed in business days rather than days (and vice versa for the deadline in
Rule 13d-2(d))?
33. If we adopt our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-2(b), should we retain Rule 13d-2(c)’s
amendment obligation for QIIs as proposed? Or does the proposed shortened filing
deadline in Rule 13d-2(b) obviate the need for Rule 13d-2(c)’s additional amendment
obligation, even with the proposed shorter filing deadline?
34. Should the amendment filing deadline applicable to Passive Investors differ from the
amendment filing deadline applicable to QIIs and Exempt Investors, as well as persons
who must make their initial filing on Schedule 13D? If so, why?
6. Rules 13(a)(4) and 201(a) of Regulation S-T
a. Background
Regulation 13D-G states that Schedules 13D and 13G should be prepared in accordance
with Regulation S-T, which governs the preparation and submission of documents filed
electronically on the Commission’s EDGAR system. In accordance with 17 CFR 232.12,
EDGAR accepts electronic submissions Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, from 6
a.m. to 10 p.m. eastern time.74 Under Rule 13(a)(2) of Regulation S-T, however, most filings not
accepted by 5:30 p.m. will not be credited with having been received by the Commission on that
business day. 75 Instead, filings accepted after 5:30 p.m. but on or before 10 p.m. will be reflected
on EDGAR as having been received on the next business day. 76 Rule 13(a)(4) of Regulation S-T,

74 17 CFR 232.12(a). When we refer to “eastern time” in this release, we mean eastern standard time or eastern
daylight saving time, whichever is currently in effect.
75 17 CFR 232.13(a)(2).
76 Id.
46
however, sets forth certain exceptions from that 5:30 p.m. “cut-off” time. Specifically, it
provides that certain filings—namely, Forms 3, 4 and 5 and Schedule 14N—“submitted by direct
transmission on or before 10 p.m. [eastern time] shall be deemed filed on the same business
day.”77 Rule 13(a)(4), therefore, effectively extends the “cut-off” time for these filings from 5:30
p.m. to 10 p.m.
In addition, Rule 201 of Regulation S-T and 17 CFR 232.202 (“Rule 202 of Regulation
S-T”) address hardship exemptions from EDGAR filing requirements, and Rule 13(b) of
Regulation S-T addresses the related issue of filing date adjustments. A filer may obtain a
temporary hardship exemption under Rule 201 of Regulation S-T if it experiences unanticipated
technical difficulties that prevent the timely submission of an electronic filing by submitting a
properly formatted paper copy of the filing under cover of Form TH.78 Alternatively, instead of
pursuing a hardship exemption, a filer may request a filing date adjustment under Rule 13(b) of
Regulation S-T. This rule addresses circumstances in which a filer attempts in good faith to file
a document with the Commission in a timely manner, but the filing is delayed due to technical
difficulties beyond the filer’s control.79 In those instances, the filer may request a filing date
adjustment.80 The staff may grant the request if it appears that the adjustment is appropriate and
consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.81
b. Proposed Amendments

77 17 CFR 232.13(a)(4). Rule 13(a)(3) also provides the same accommodation for registration statements or any
post-effective amendment thereto filed pursuant to Rule 462(b). See 17 CFR 232.13(a)(3).

We recognize the administrative challenges that could arise if we accelerate the
Schedules 13D and 13G filing deadlines. Specifically, Schedule 13D and 13G filers would be
required to prepare their filings in a more compressed timeframe while maintaining the accuracy
and completeness of the information set forth in those filings. These challenges would be more
acute for filers located in different time zones whose business hours do not overlap with the
Commission’s. In addition, institutional filers with more complex business organizations,
including those with sub-advisory relationships common in the investment management industry,
may have difficulty assembling all of the required data within the timeframe that will be
necessary in order to comply with the proposed filing deadlines. We also recognize that if the
proposed changes to those reporting deadlines are implemented, under the current rules, a
Schedule 13D or 13G must be filed on and accepted by EDGAR by no later than 5:30 p.m. on a
business day on which such a report would be due in order to have the submission be considered
timely. We propose, therefore, to amend Rule 13(a)(4) of Regulation S-T to provide that any
Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G, including any amendments thereto, submitted by direct
transmission on or before 10 p.m. eastern time on a given business day will be deemed filed on
the same business day. 82 Conversely, any Schedule 13D or 13G submission not accepted by 10
p.m. on its due date will be assigned a filing date of the next business day, and for purposes of
compliance with the applicable reporting requirements, would be considered late.83 Given the

82 Notwithstanding the proposed extension of the time period in which accepted Schedule 13D and 13G filings may
be made and still be considered timely, filer support hours would not be extended. Filer support would continue to
remain available only until 6 p.m. eastern time as is currently the case notwithstanding EDGAR’s availability for the
submission of Section 16 filings through 10 p.m.
83 Once transmitted, a Schedule 13D or 13G submission will be automatically processed by EDGAR and, if accepted
by EDGAR, immediately disseminated to the public. While filings will receive an accession number upon
transmission, the accession number only confirms receipt of the submission, not that it was actually accepted by
EDGAR. Transmission without acceptance does not constitute an official filing. Under 17 CFR 232.11, an “official
filing” means any filing that is received and accepted by the Commission. At present, a transmission that has
commenced on a given business day will only receive that business day’s filing date if “accepted” at or before 5:30
48
accelerated filing deadlines we propose for Schedule 13D and 13G filings, we anticipate the
proposed extension in the “cut-off” time would ease filers’ administrative burdens, including
those located in different time zones, by giving them an additional four and a half hours during
which they could timely file their Schedules 13D and 13G.
We also propose to amend Rule 201(a) of Regulation S-T to remove the opportunity for a
Schedule 13D or 13G filer to pursue a temporary hardship exemption under that rule. This
proposed treatment is consistent with our treatment of Forms 3, 4, and 5, each of which has a 10
p.m. “cut-off” time under Rule 13(a)(4) of Regulation S-T and is ineligible for a temporary
hardship exemption under Rule 201(a) of Regulation S-T. We are proposing to amend Rule
201(a) of Regulation S-T to make temporary hardship exemptions unavailable to filers of
Schedules 13D and 13G because of: the relative ease of using the EDGAR on-line filing system;
the proposed extended 10 p.m. eastern time filing deadline; the limited value to the public of
paper filings; and the availability of a filing date adjustment under the same circumstances as a
temporary hardship exemption would have been available but for the proposed amendment.84
Request for Comment

p.m., meaning that it has successfully passed an acceptance review. An official filing has not been made unless and
until the filer receives an acceptance message that includes a filing date. Accordingly, the filer is responsible for
ensuring a transmission commences early enough in the business day to correct any errors in the transmittal process
so that time-sensitive filings can be accepted by the applicable deadline.
84 Filing date adjustments, as would have been true of temporary hardship exemptions, should be few in number
given the relative ease with which filings are now made through EDGAR and the strong public interest in timely and
readily available disclosures provided by Schedules 13D and 13G. As is also the case with other forms required to
be filed on EDGAR, our filing desk would not accept in paper format any Schedule 13D or 13G filings except in the
highly unlikely event that the filing satisfies the requirements for a continuing hardship exemption under Rule 202
of Regulation S-T. Filing date adjustments may, however, be made if a filer is unable to submit its Schedule 13D or
13G as a result of an EDGAR outage. In such circumstances, if a filer attempts in good faith to file its Schedule
13D or 13G in a timely manner but is delayed because of an EDGAR outage, that filer may request a filing date
adjustment under Rule 13(b) of Regulation S-T on the grounds that such outage constitutes technical difficulties
beyond the filer’s control. 17 CFR 232.13(b). Alternatively, the Commission may, under 17 CFR 232.15(a)(3),
correct the filing date of a Schedule 13D or 13G filing if it determines that such filing has not been processed by
EDGAR or was processed incorrectly by EDGAR.

of the proposed accelerated filing deadlines applicable to persons who are required to

those who file Section 16 reports or Schedule 14N?

due date, the same deadline as almost all other Commission filings?
39. Should we amend Rule 201 of Regulation S-T as proposed?

Commission for a temporary hardship exemption under Rule 201 of Regulation S-T,
especially if we were to adopt the proposed amendment to Rule 13(a)(4) of Regulation ST to extend the “cut-off” times for Schedules 13D and 13G?

applicable to beneficial owners who make Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G filings, should
we still adopt the proposed amendments to Rules 13 and 201 of Regulation S-T?
B. Proposed Amendment to Rule 13d-3 to Regulate the Use of Cash-Settled
Derivative Securities
We are proposing to amend Rule 13d-3 to deem holders of certain cash-settled derivative
securities to be the beneficial owners of the reference covered class. Specifically, we are
proposing to add new paragraph (e) to Rule 13d-3. As discussed in more detail below, in
50
addition to setting forth the circumstances under which a holder of a cash-settled derivative
security will be deemed the beneficial owner of the reference equity securities, proposed Rule
13d-3(e) also includes provisions describing how to calculate the number of reference equity
securities that a holder of a cash-settled derivative will be deemed to beneficially own.
1. Background
Neither Section 3(a) nor Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act define the term “beneficial
owner” or “beneficial ownership.” Regulation 13D-G similarly does not expressly define those
terms. To provide clarity, the Commission adopted Rule 13d-3, which provides standards for the
purpose of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner subject to Section 13(d).85 For
example, Rule 13d-3(a) provides that a person who directly or indirectly has or shares voting or
investment power is a beneficial owner. The Commission also recognized the importance of
accounting for contingent interests in equity securities arising from investor use of derivatives,
such as options, warrants or rights. The Commission therefore chose to include holders of
certain derivatives as beneficial owners under Rule 13d-3: those derivatives that would be
settled “in-kind” or otherwise convey a right to acquire a covered class.86 Specifically, under
Rule 13d-3(d)(1), a person is “deemed” a beneficial owner of a covered class if that person holds
a right to acquire the covered class—for example, through the exercise of an option or warrant or
conversion of a security—that is exercisable or convertible within 60 days. Similarly, under
Rule 13d-3(d)(1), if a right has been acquired for the purpose or with the effect of changing or

particular situation is essential in order to identify each person possessing the requisite voting power or investment
power.” Id. at 12344.

influencing control of the issuer of securities, that person is treated as a beneficial owner of the
underlying class of equity securities regardless of when that right may be exercisable,
exchangeable or convertible. At the same time, however, holding derivatives that, by their
terms, entitle the holder to nothing more than economic exposure to a covered class historically
has not been considered sufficient to constitute beneficial ownership.87
Over the years, commenters have raised concerns about the fact that current Rule 13d-3
fails to explicitly address the circumstances in which an investor in a cash-settled derivative may
influence or control an issuer by pressuring a counterparty to make certain decisions regarding
the voting and disposition of substantial blocks of securities.88 An investor in a cash-settled
derivative may be positioned, by virtue of its commercial relationship with a counterparty, to
acquire any reference securities that the counterparty may acquire to hedge the economic risk of
that transaction, including any obligations that may arise in connection with settlement.89 Entry

will please the investor and induce them to continue to transact with such counterparty. . . . Even those derivatives

into the agreement governing the derivative may, therefore, result in a rapid accumulation of a
covered class by a counterparty similar to the types of accumulations that prompted Congress to
enact Section 13(d). In addition, if institutional counterparties hold sizable positions of reference
securities with a view toward future sales to holders of cash-settled derivative securities, a
regulatory concern arises under Rule 13d-3(b).90 For example, if an arrangement or
understanding exists outside of the terms of a derivative instrument that enables an investor to
acquire the reference securities from a counterparty, the reference securities could be viewed as
having been impermissibly “parked” with the counterparty on behalf of the derivative holder.91
The use of cash-settled derivative securities in the change of control context also may
serve as a catalyst for related acquisitions of beneficial ownership by institutional counterparties
that ultimately could contribute to a shift in corporate control. 92 The Commission previously
determined that the “concentration of voting power in a single block and its transferability are
material information to the market.”93 Holders of cash-settled derivatives also may have
incentives to influence or control outcomes at the issuer of the reference security just as they

90 Rule 13d-3(b) deems persons to be the beneficial owners of a covered class if they have used an arrangement that
otherwise prevented the vesting of beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade Section 13(d) or 13(g).
17 CFR 240.13d-3(b).
91 The Commission has pursued beneficial ownership reporting violations at least twice based on the unreported
“parking” of equity securities with another party where such securities are essentially held in reserve for the benefit
of the party with the intention to control or ultimately acquire them. See SEC v. First City Financial Corp., 890
F.2d 1215 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In that case, the Commission charged First City Financial Corp. with using a parking
arrangement with Bear, Stearns Cos. to avoid filing a Schedule l3D. After First City had acquired 4.9 percent of the
stock of Ashland Oil, Inc., Bear Stearns agreed to acquire stock on behalf of First City and to sell the stock to First
City once a sizable position was obtained. The district court concluded that First City deliberately attempted to
circumvent the law. See SEC v. First City Fin. Corp., 688 F. Supp. 705 (D.D.C. 1988); see also SEC v. Boyd L.
Jefferies, Lit. Rel. No. 11370 (Mar. 19, 1987).

would if they directly owned the reference security outright. Although holders of derivatives
settled exclusively in cash ordinarily would lack the express legal power under the terms of such
instruments to direct the voting or disposition of a covered class, such holders may possess
economic power that can be used to produce desired outcomes through engagement with a
counterparty or the issuer of the reference security and potentially could impact the stock price.94
An unwinding of agreements governing cash-settled derivatives also could adversely impact the
stock price of an issuer, just as if the holder of the cash-settled derivative held the stock directly,
instead of the counterparty, and sold sizable blocks of such shares. Consequently, counterparty
dispositions of reference securities at the conclusion of a cash-settled derivative agreement,
should they occur all together or involve high concentrations of beneficial ownership, may
impair the orderly operation and efficiency of our capital markets. In the event of a default,
these derivative positions could not only adversely impact counterparties, but also issuers of
reference securities, the markets and other market participants. At a minimum, greater
transparency could influence counterparties’ risk management decisions. Proposed Rule 13d3(e) is thus designed to make information available about any large positions in cash-settled
derivative securities and, by implication, the related reference securities. Under specified
conditions, if holders of cash-settled derivatives were deemed beneficial owners of the reference
securities in combination with the other amendments proposed in this release, the resulting

disclosures could alert issuers and the market to the possibility of rapid accumulations of, and
high concentrations in, a covered class.95
By extending Rule 13d-3 to include certain persons who purchase cash-settled equitybased derivatives, investors, issuers and other market participants should have greater
transparency regarding persons with significant interests in an issuer’s equity securities and
potential control intent. In particular, the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3 could address
concerns that financial product innovation has outpaced the reach of a rule provision first
adopted by the Commission in 1968. Cash-settled derivatives imitate the economic performance
of a direct investment in an issuer’s equity securities and, in turn, may economically empower
the holders of such derivatives to influence the issuer or the price of its securities. 96 Under
current Rule 13d-3, however, the holder of the cash-settled derivative generally is not subject to
beneficial ownership reporting obligations. Given such person’s potential to influence or change
control of the issuer, we are proposing an amendment that would, in specified circumstances,
deem the holder of a cash-settled derivative security to be the beneficial owner of the reference
security. For the reasons set forth above and as explained more fully below, we believe such an
amendment is necessary for the protection of investors and appropriate in order to achieve the
purpose of Section 13(d). We also believe that requiring reporting based wholly or partly upon
the holding of such positions would be in the public interest.
2. Proposed Amendment

95 Section 13(d) was intended to “alert the market place to every large, rapid aggregation or accumulation of
securities, regardless of technique employed, which might represent a potential shift in corporate control.” GAF
Corp. v. Milstein, 453 F.2d 709, 717 (2d. Cir. 1971), cert denied, 406 U.S. 910 (1972).
96 See supra note 88.
55
As noted above, we are proposing to amend Rule 13d-3 to add new paragraph (e). Like
Rules 13d-3(b) and (d)(1), proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would provide that holders of certain cashsettled derivative securities will be “deemed” a beneficial owner of the reference securities in a
covered class. 97 Specifically, proposed Rule 13d-3(e)(1) would provide that a holder of a cashsettled derivative security98 shall be deemed the beneficial owner of equity securities in the
covered class referenced by the derivative security if such person holds the derivative security
with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer of such class of
equity securities, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose
or effect.99 As discussed in more detail below, the concept “purpose or effect of changing or
influencing the control of the issuer” is a familiar one under Regulation 13D-G,100 both in the

97 It is possible under our current regulatory framework that a holder of a cash-settled derivative security could be
deemed the beneficial owner of the reference securities under Rule 13d-3(b) by virtue of their counterparty
relationships if such relationships constitute “a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of section 13(d)
or (g).” 17 CFR 240.13d-3(b). Application of that rule, however, would require an examination of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the relationship between the holder of a cash-settled derivative security and its
counterparty, the intentions of the parties with respect to such relationship and the effect of such relationship on the
holder’s beneficial ownership of the reference securities. Id. By contrast, proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would require a
comparatively less extensive and more streamlined inquiry in order for a holder of a cash-settled derivative security
to be deemed the beneficial owner of the reference securities, focusing predominantly on whether the derivative
security is held with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer of the reference
securities.
98 For purposes of proposed Rule 13d-3(e), the term “derivative security” would have the meaning set forth in 17
CFR 240.16a-1(c) (“Rule 16a-1(c)”). See Rule 16a-1(c) (defining “derivative securities” as including certain rights,
such as options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation rights or similar rights “with an exercise or
conversion privilege at a price related to an equity security, or similar securities with a value derived from the value
of an equity security,” excluding certain enumerated rights, obligations, interests and options). As discussed infra
notes 110-114 and the accompanying text, however, for purposes of proposed Rule 13d-3(e), the term “derivative
security” does not include security-based swaps, as defined in Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.
99 The provision at 17 CFR 240.12b-2 (“Rule 12b-2 of Regulation 12B”) defines the term “control” to mean “the
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.” The provision at 17 CFR
240.12b-1 sets forth the scope of Regulation 12B, and provides that all rules contained in Regulation 12B “shall
govern . . . all reports filed pursuant to section[ ] 13.”
100 See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.13d-102. Under Item 10 of Schedule 13G, QIIs and Passive Investors must certify that the
“securities . . . were not acquired and are not held for the purpose of or with the effect of changing or influencing the
control of the issuer.” Id.
56
context of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner under Rule 13d-3101 and for
purposes of determining whether a beneficial owner is eligible to report on Schedule 13G in lieu
of Schedule 13D under Rule 13d-1.102 As such, we believe that use of this phrase in proposed
Rule 13d-3(e) would ease the administrative burdens associated with application of this proposed
provision.
Persons who acquire and hold cash-settled derivative securities with the purpose or effect
of changing or influencing control of the issuer may seek to use their position to influence the
voting, acquisition or disposition of any shares the counterparty may have acquired in a hedge,
proprietary investment or otherwise. Moreover, the economic realities of the counterparty
relationship mean that, even absent an express right to direct the voting, acquisition or
disposition of such shares, the holders of cash-settled derivative securities could be wellpositioned to pursue a change in control. The derivative holder’s counterparty may have a
business relationship to develop and protect, and thus may ultimately cast votes in accordance
with the preference of the derivative holder. Even if any counterparty shares are not voted, the
derivative holder’s probability of success in exerting influence or control over the issuer of the
reference security may increase given that any voting power the derivative holder held would be
magnified by minimizing the number of shares that potentially could be voted against its plans or
proposals. Similarly, while the terms of the derivative instrument may only provide for
settlement in cash, these types of derivative holders could remain in a position to acquire any

101 See 17 CFR 240.13d-3(d)(1)(i) (providing that “any person who acquires a security or power specified in
paragraph[] (d)(1)(i) . . . with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer, or in
connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect” shall be deemed a beneficial
owner immediately upon such acquisition).
102 See 17 CFR 240.13d-1(b)(1)(i), (c)(1) and (e)(1)(i). In addition to these provisions, Rules 13d-3(b) and 13d5(b)(2)(ii) also incorporate a “purpose or effect” standard.
57
reference securities that the counterparty may acquire to hedge the economic risk of that
transaction. In recognition that an investment in a cash-settled derivative instrument could be
converted into direct holdings of the reference security via an amendment to the instrument or
otherwise, persons who use cash-settled derivatives also may present these economic positions to
an issuer or its shareholders as a basis on which they should engage with them. 103 These persons,
therefore, hold their cash-settled derivative securities in a manner that implicates the policies
underlying Section 13(d).104
Proposing that application of Rule 13d-3(e) be conditioned on a person holding the
derivative security with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer
of such class of equity securities, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction
having such purpose or effect is consistent with other provisions of our beneficial ownership
rules. Rule 13d-3(d)(1) contains this same condition. Specifically, Rule 13d-3(d)(1) provides
that if a right has been acquired for the purpose or with the effect of changing or influencing
control of the issuer of securities, the holder of that right is immediately treated as a beneficial
owner of the underlying class of equity securities regardless of when that right may be
exercisable, exchangeable or convertible. In such instances, the holder of such a right would not
be entitled to voting or investment power over the underlying security for a substantial period of
time that may extend far beyond 60 days. Nonetheless, the Commission believed it appropriate
to immediately deem these persons to be the beneficial owners of such underlying securities

103 See infra note 263 and accompanying text.
104 See Filing and Disclosure Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Release No. 34-14692 (Apr. 21,
1978) [43 FR 18484 at 18484 (Apr. 28, 1978)] (noting that Section 13(d)’s legislative history indicates that the
purpose of that section is “to provide information to the public and the affected issuer about rapid accumulations of
its equity securities” by “persons who would then have the potential to change or influence control of the issuer”).
58
because it recognized that such a right, when acquired for the purpose or with the effect of
changing or influencing control, can be used to influence the control of the issuer even before the
right is exercisable. 105 We recognize that cash-settled derivative securities differ from the rights
covered under Rule 13d-3(d)(1) in that they ordinarily do not entitle their holders to acquire the
reference securities. To the extent such derivative security is held with the purpose or effect of
changing or influencing the control of the issuer, however, we believe that the potential for a
holder of a cash-settled derivative security to exert influence on a counterparty that may directly
hold the reference securities implicates the same concerns that the Commission articulated in
adopting Rule 13d-3(d)(1). Thus, we believe that deeming such holders to be beneficial owners
of the reference securities would be consistent with the Commission’s longstanding view of the
right to acquire beneficial ownership as described in Rule 13d-3(d)(1).
In addition, as with the treatment of in-kind-settled derivative securities under Rule 13d3(d)(1)(i), proposed paragraph (e)(1) also would include a provision stating that any securities
that are not outstanding but are referenced by the relevant cash-settled derivative security will be
deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of calculating the percentage of the relevant covered
class beneficially owned by the holder of the derivative security. Those reference securities,
however, will not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of any other person’s calculation
of the percentage of the covered class it beneficially owns.
The disclosures that would be made in a Schedule 13D as a result of treating holders of
cash-settled derivative securities as beneficial owners would provide needed transparency
regarding the potential to influence or control the issuer of the reference security. If cash-settled

105 Id. at 18490 (stating that “the acquisition of [such a right] offers a distinct possibility for actions which are for the
purpose or with the effect of changing or influencing control” including, for example, “obtaining an interest in a
block of securities large enough to influence control, or in coupling an option with an agreement concerning the
composition of the board of directors”).
59
derivative holders with an intent to influence or control the issuer become Schedule 13D filers
based on their economic exposure to the reference security as a result of the proposed
amendment to Rule 13d-3, then their plans or proposals would become publicly available. At
present, such intentions remain undisclosed unless the person is determined to be a beneficial
owner under Rule 13d-3 on other grounds.
Proposed paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 13d-3 would set forth the formula for calculating the
number of equity securities that a holder of a cash-settled derivative will be deemed to
beneficially own pursuant to paragraph (e)(1). This provision is necessary because derivatives
may not always have a perfect “one-to-one” relationship to the reference security. Instead, the
value of the derivative security, although based on the value of a reference security, may change
at a multiple or fraction to any change in value of the reference security, particularly in the case
of a security option. This difference in the amount by which the value of a derivative security
changes as compared to the amount by which the value of the reference security changes is
referred to as the “delta.” For example, a $1 change in the value of the reference security may
result in a $2 change in the value of the derivative security. In that case, the delta of the
derivative security would be equal to two. If the delta of a derivative security is equal to one,
then the value of the derivative security perfectly tracks the changes in value of the reference
security. Calculation of beneficial ownership pursuant to a derivative security is easier in these
circumstances because of the perfect one-to-one relationship between the derivative security and
the reference security.
Proposed paragraph (e)(2) applies these concepts for purposes of determining the number
of securities that a holder of a cash-settled derivative will be deemed to beneficially own
pursuant to paragraph (e)(1). Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of Rule 13d-3 defines “delta” to
mean, with respect to a derivative security, the ratio that that is obtained by comparing (x) the
change in the value of the derivative security to (y) the change in the value of the reference
60
equity security. Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i) provides that the number of securities that a holder
of such derivative security will be deemed to beneficially own pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) will
be the larger of two calculations, set forth in proposed paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (B), in each
case as applicable. If applicable, proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) would calculate the number of
securities as the product of (x) the number of securities by reference to which the amount
payable under the derivative security is determined multiplied by (y) the delta of the derivative
security. 106 Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B), if applicable, would calculate the number of
securities by (x) dividing the notional amount of the derivative security by the most recent
closing market price of the reference equity security, and then (y) multiplying such quotient by
the delta of the derivative security. 107
Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) would be applicable if the agreement governing the
terms of the derivative security provides a way to calculate the number of reference securities on
which the amount payable pursuant to that security is based. Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B)
would be applicable if the agreement governing the terms of the derivative security does not
provide such a methodology for determining the applicable number of reference securities.
Thus, there will be some derivative securities to which proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) will be
inapplicable (i.e., those derivative securities for which the agreement does not provide a way to
calculate the number of reference securities on which the amount payable pursuant to that

106 As an illustration of the application of this proposed rule, a holder of a derivative security with a delta equal to
one that references 100 shares of a covered class of common stock would be deemed to beneficially own 100 shares
of such covered class. If, however, that derivative security had a delta equal to two, then such holder would be
deemed to beneficially own 200 shares of such covered class, calculated as (x) the 100 shares of common stock
referenced by the derivative security multiplied by (y) the derivative security’s delta of two.
107 As an illustration of the application of this proposed rule, if a person holds a derivative security with a notional
amount of $100 and a delta equal to one that references a covered class of common stock with a most recent closing
market price of $10 per share, then that person would be deemed to beneficially own 10 shares of such covered
class. If, however, that same derivative security had a delta equal to two, then such person would be deemed to
beneficially own 20 shares of such covered class, calculated as (x) the quotient obtained by dividing the $100
notional amount of the derivative security by the $10 per share most recent closing market price, (y) multiplied by
the derivative security’s delta of two.
61
security is based). On the other hand, proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) will be applicable to all
derivative securities (i.e., because the calculation set forth in that paragraph can be performed
regardless of whether the agreement governing the terms of the derivative security provides a
methodology for determining the applicable number of reference securities). As such, to address
those scenarios in which both paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (B) apply, paragraph (e)(2)(i) provides
that the number of securities that a holder of a derivative security will be deemed to beneficially
own pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) will be the larger of the two amounts yielded by those
paragraphs.
The proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3 also includes three notes to paragraph (e)(2).
The first note provides that, for purposes of determining the number of equity securities that a
holder of a cash-settled derivative security will be deemed to beneficially own, only long
positions in derivative securities should be counted. Short positions, whether held directly
against a covered class or synthetically through a cash-settled derivative security, should not be
netted against long positions or otherwise taken into account.108 The second note provides that,
when calculating the number of securities that a holder of such derivative security will be
deemed to beneficially own pursuant to paragraph (e)(1), the calculation in paragraph

108 “Short positions,” such as those within the meaning of the term as defined in 17 CFR 240. 14e-4(a)(1)(ii) (“Rule
14e-4(a)(1)(ii)”), are not treated as beneficial ownership under current Rule 13d-3. In addition, Section 13(d)(1)
applies to persons who “acquire” beneficial ownership, and the aggregate amount of beneficial ownership held, as
determined under Rule 13d-3(c), including certain contingent interests in a covered class, is required to be reported.
As such, a beneficial owner subject to Section 13(d) or 13(g) reports its capacity to vote or dispose of a covered
class whether through power it directly or indirectly holds or is deemed to hold under Rule 13d-3(d) by virtue of its
contingent interest. The regulatory framework, therefore, only applies to persons who hold the equivalent of a “long
position” within the meaning of the term as defined in Rule 14e-4(a)(1)(i). Persons who hold “short positions” have
no such capacity to vote or dispose of a covered class and thus are beyond the scope of Sections 13(d) and 13(g) and
Regulation 13D-G with the exception that a beneficial owner that otherwise must report on Schedule 13D may incur
disclosure obligations with respect to any short sale activity, such as those arising under Item 6 of Schedule 13D.
See 17 CFR 240.13d-101 (requiring disclosure of “any contracts . . . with respect to . . . any securities of the issuer”).
A beneficial owner is not required to report its “net long position” within the meaning of such term as defined in
Rule 14e-4(a)(1), and we are not currently proposing any changes in this regard.
62
(e)(2)(i)(B) should be performed on a daily basis. Similarly, the third note provides that if a
derivative security does not have a fixed delta (i.e., if the delta is variable and changes over the
term of the derivative security), then a person who holds such derivative security should
calculate the delta on a daily basis, for purposes of determining the number of equity securities
that such person will be deemed to beneficially own, based on the closing market price of the
reference equity security on that day. Although we recognize that such daily calculations may
impose administrative burdens on holders of derivative securities, this approach will help to
ensure the accuracy of beneficial ownership reporting and is consistent with the approach taken
by at least one foreign jurisdiction.109
Finally, proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would exclude from its purview security-based swaps, as
defined in Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
110 In a
separate rulemaking, the Commission has proposed to require disclosure of security-based swap
positions.111 Specifically, proposed 17 CFR 240.10B-1 (“Rule 10B-1”) would require public
reporting on Schedule 10B of, among other things: (1) certain large positions in security-based

109 See DTR 5.3.3C, Recital 7 (Jan. 1, 2021), available at
https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/DTR/5/?view=chapter (“In order to ensure that information about the
total number of voting rights accessible to the investor is as accurate as possible, delta should be calculated daily
taking into account the last closing price of the underlying share.”).
110 Proposed Rule 13d-3(e) is not subject to Exchange Act Section 13(o). Section 13(o) provides that a person shall
be “deemed” a beneficial owner of an equity security based on the purchase or sale of a security-based swap “only
to the extent that the Commission determines after consultation with the prudential regulators and the Secretary of
the Treasury, that the purchase or sale of the security-based swap, or class of security-based swap, provides
incidents of ownership comparable to direct ownership of the equity security, and that it is necessary to achieve the
purposes of this section that the purchase or sale of the security-based swaps, or class of security-based swap, be
deemed the acquisition of beneficial ownership of the equity security.” Section 13(o) applies to security-based
swaps and does not apply to other types of derivative securities. Because proposed Rule 13d-3(e) does not cover
security-based swaps, Section 13(o) is inapplicable to the proposed requirement.

against Undue Influence over Chief Compliance Officers; Position Reporting of Large Security-Based Swap

swaps; (2) positions in any security or loan underlying the security-based swap position; and (3)
any other instrument relating to the underlying security or loan or group or index of securities or
loans.112 As described in more detail in the related proposing release, proposed Rule 10B-1
would include specific quantitative thresholds for when public reporting is required and include a
schedule of all of the information that must be reported.113 We believe that the position
disclosures with respect to cash-settled security-based swaps required under our proposed Rule
10B-1, if adopted, would provide sufficient information regarding holdings of security-based
swaps such that additional regulation under Regulation 13D-G at this time would be
unnecessarily duplicative.114 Further, to the extent that investors seek to use cash-settled
derivatives other than security-based swaps in order to bypass the disclosures that Rule 10B-1
would require, Rule 13d-3(e), if adopted, would help prevent the exploitation of any regulatory
gap between Schedule 10B and Schedule 13D that might otherwise exist.
Request for Comment
42. Should we amend Rule 13d-3 as proposed to deem persons who acquire or hold cashsettled derivative securities with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the
control of the issuer, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having
such purpose or effect, as beneficial owners? Would the proposed rule sufficiently reduce
the opportunities for persons to utilize cash-settled derivative securities to evade reporting
under Section 13(d)?

112 Id. at 6657.
113 Id. For example, a person would be required to file a Schedule 10B once the “Security-Based Swap Equivalent
Position” (as described in the proposing release for Rule 10B-1 [87 FR 6652 (Feb. 4, 2022)]) represents more than
5% of a class of equity securities. Id. at n.138 and accompanying text.
114 But see Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements and Security-Based Swaps, Release No. 34-64628 (June
8, 2011) [76 FR 34579 (June 14, 2011)] (readopting without change the relevant portions of Rules 13d-3 and 16a-1
to preserve the application of those rules to persons who purchased or sold security-based swaps after the effective
date of Section 13(o) by making the determinations required by Section 13(o) after consultation with prudential
regulators and the Secretary of the Treasury).
64
43. Would the circumstances in which a holder acquires or holds a cash-settled derivative
security with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer be
reasonably determinable? Should we provide further guidance on this point? Rather than
amending Rule 13d-3 to deem as beneficial owners persons who acquire or hold cashsettled derivative securities with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the
control of the issuer, should we incorporate standards for establishing when a person
becomes a beneficial owner that are more objectively determinable? For example, should
we identify more specific indicia such as any of the plans described in Item 4 of Schedule
13D?
44. Can a cash-settled derivative be used to influence or change the control of an issuer? If
so, please explain how the terms of the derivative security or the derivative investor’s
relationship with a counterparty can effectuate that influence or change in control. For
example, are cash-settled derivative contracts executed on a scale large enough to impact
the voting by counterparties and thus the margins of victory on proposals put forth by the
issuer of a covered class for shareholder approval?
45. Instead of treating holders of cash-settled derivative securities as beneficial owners,
should we instead amend Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G to expressly include more
comprehensive line item disclosure requirements concerning the use of cash-settled
derivative securities? For example, should Item 6 of Schedule 13D be further revised to
ask for a full description of any cash-settled derivative’s material terms, and Item 7 of
Schedule 13D be revised to explicitly require the filing of cash-settled derivative
instruments as an exhibit?
46. Regardless of whether proposed Rule 13d-3(e) is adopted, should the Commission
increase the 60-day time period specified in Rule 13d-3(d)(1) so that persons who hold
contingent interests in a covered class will be deemed beneficial owners earlier? If so,
65
would 90, 120, 180 or some greater number of days serve as the optimal date by which to
deem persons who hold such interests, such as derivative holders, as beneficial owners?
47. For purposes of proposed Rule 13d-3(e), the term “derivative security” would have the
meaning set forth in Rule 16a-1(c), excluding security-based swaps. Are there other types
of derivatives (other than security-based swaps) that should be included within the
purview of proposed Rule 13d-3(e) that are not included in the scope of the term
“derivative securities,” as defined in Rule 16a-1(c)? For purposes of Rule 13d-3(e),
should rights with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price that is not fixed, which
Rule 16a-1(c)(6) excludes from the term “derivative securities” in Rule 16a-1(c), be
included?
48. Is our proposed inclusion of the concept of “delta” in Rule 13d-3(e) appropriate? If so, are
the proposed application and definition of “delta” in Rules 13d-3(e)(2)(i) and (ii),
respectively, appropriate for purposes of determining the number of equity securities that a
holder of a cash-settled derivative security is deemed to beneficially own?
49. For securities where the “delta,” as we propose to define it, is not equal to 1, is our
proposed calculation of the number of securities beneficially owned appropriate? Should
the calculation be performed in another way? For example, should the calculation be
limited to the number of reference securities contemplated by the instrument?
50. Should we include the three proposed notes to Rule 13d-3(e)(2)? Should only long
positions in derivative securities be counted for purposes of determining the number of
equity securities that a holder of a cash-settled derivative security will be deemed to
beneficially own, as proposed? As an alternative to proposed Note 1 to Rule 13d-3(e)(2),
should short positions in cash-settled derivative securities be netted against long positions
or otherwise taken into account for purposes of determining the number of equity
securities that a holder of a cash-settled derivative security will be deemed to beneficially
66
own? If not, how should they be taken into account? For purposes of Notes 2 and 3 to
Rule 13d-3(e)(2), is “daily,” as proposed, the appropriate frequency, or should those
calculations be performed with a different frequency (e.g., on a weekly or monthly basis)?
Is the proposed daily frequency of these calculations unduly burdensome on holders of
cash-settled derivative securities? Other than the frequency with which the calculation
must be performed, are there other difficulties associated with these calculations that
would also make them burdensome?
51. For purposes of the calculations in Rule 13d-3(e)(2)(i)(B) and Note 3 to Rule 13d-3(e)(2),
is the closing market price of the reference equity security, as proposed, the appropriate
basis for those calculations, or is there a different basis that is more appropriate (e.g., the
volume-weighted average trading price of the reference equity security throughout a given
day)?
52. Could the daily calculation requirements in proposed Notes 2 and 3 to Rule 13d-3(e)(2)
result in situations in which a person’s beneficial ownership does not exceed 5% of a
covered class at the time that person acquires a derivative security, but then exceeds 5% at
a later time solely by virtue of the fact that the closing market price of the reference equity
security or the delta of the derivative security, as applicable, has changed (i.e., not as a
result of any further acquisitions)? If so, would it be appropriate to subject that person to
the obligations of the beneficial ownership reporting regime under such circumstances?
53. Would proposed Rule 10B-1 provide sufficient information regarding holdings of cashsettled security-based swaps such that beneficial ownership reporting of cash-settled
security-based swaps under Regulation 13D-G is unnecessary, or should beneficial
ownership derived from cash-settled security-based swaps be included under Regulation
13D-G? If the information regarding holdings of cash-settled security-based swaps that
would be required pursuant to proposed Rule 10B-1 were not available, would there be a
67
need for the beneficial ownership derived from cash-settled security-based swaps to be
included under Regulation 13D-G?
C. Proposed Amendments to Rule 13d-5 to Affirm Its Application and Operation
We are proposing a series of amendments to Rule 13d-5 to clarify and affirm its
application to two or more persons who “act as” a group under Sections 13(d)(3) and (g)(3) of
the Exchange Act. Specifically, we are proposing to amend Rule 13d-5 to:
• Change the title of the rule from “Acquisition of securities” to “Acquisition of beneficial
ownership” to more accurately reflect the purpose, application and operation of the rule
and ensure its consistency with Section 13(d)(1);
• Revise Rule 13d-5(a) to conform the text to the new title and Section 13(d);
• Redesignate paragraph (b)(1) as paragraph (b)(1)(i) and revise it to remove the potential
implication that it sets forth the exclusive legal standard for group formation under
Section 13(d)(3) or 13(g)(3);
• Add new paragraph (b)(1)(ii) to specify that if a person, in advance of filing a Schedule
13D, discloses to any other person that such filing will be made and such other person
acquires securities in the covered class for which the Schedule 13D will be filed, those
persons shall be deemed to have formed a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3);
• Add new paragraph (b)(1)(iii) to specify that a group subject to reporting obligations
under Section 13(d) shall be deemed to acquire any additional equity securities acquired
by a member of the group after the date of the group’s formation;
• Add new paragraph (b)(1)(iv) to carve out from paragraph (b)(1)(iii) any intra-group
transfers of equity securities;
• Add new paragraph (b)(2)(i) to specify that when two or more persons “act as” a group
under Section 13(g)(3) of the Act, the group shall be deemed to have become the
68
beneficial owner, for purposes of Sections 13(g)(1) and (2) of the Act, of the beneficial
ownership held by its members;
• Add new paragraph (b)(2)(ii) to specify that a group regulated under Section 13(g) shall
be deemed to acquire any additional equity securities acquired by a member of the group
after the date of the group’s formation; and
• Add new paragraph (b)(2)(iii) to carve out from paragraph (b)(2)(ii) any intra-group
transfers of equity securities.
In addition, the proposed amendments would redesignate current Rule 13d-5(b)(2) as new Rule
13d-6(b). This change is discussed both in this section and in Section II.D, which describes our
proposed amendments to Rule 13d-6.
1. Background
Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) are identical, and each of these two provisions provides
that “[w]hen two or more persons act as a . . . group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or
disposing of securities of an issuer, such syndicate or group shall be deemed a ‘person.’” Neither
of these two provisions defines the term “group.” The determination of whether coordinated
efforts among two or more persons constitutes a group subject to regulation as a single “person”
under these two statutory provisions is a question of fact. Congress enacted these provisions
based on two practical considerations. First, Sections 13(d)(1) and 13(g)(1), by their terms,
apply to, and impose filing obligations upon, a single “person.” Second, Congress recognized
the need to protect against the evasion of disclosure requirements by persons who collectively
69
sought to change or influence control of an issuer yet who each acquired and held an amount of
beneficial ownership at or just below the reporting threshold.115
Congress sought to address this problem of coordinated circumvention by “deeming” two
or more persons to be one person for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g). Based on the
statutory treatment of two or more persons as if they were one person when they “act as” a group
for at least one of the three purposes specified in the statutory provisions (i.e., acquiring, holding
or disposing of securities of an issuer), the beneficial ownership collectively held by the group
members is imputed to the group. To the extent the aggregate amount of beneficial ownership
exceeds 5% of a covered class, the group may be required to file a beneficial ownership report.
In these situations, a fundamental question arises as to whether the group is subject to
Section 13(d) or Section 13(g). The determination of which statutory provision applies to a
group depends on whether a non-exempt acquisition of beneficial ownership has been made that
can be imputed to the group, and, when on its own or added to any other beneficial ownership
held by the group, results in beneficial ownership exceeding 5% of the covered class. If such an
acquisition occurs, the group is subject to regulation under Section 13(d).116 To the extent no
such acquisition attributable to the group has occurred, but the collective amount of beneficial
ownership held by the group members exceeds 5% of a covered class at the end of a calendar
year, the group is subject to Section 13(g).

115 Section 13(d)(3) was enacted to prevent “easy avoidance of section 13(d)’s disclosure requirements by a group of
investors acting together in their acquisition or holding of securities.” Senate Report No. 550, 90th Congress, 1st
Session 8 (1967); House Report No. 1711, 90th Congress, 2d Session 8-9 (1968); see also 113 Cong. Record
Proceedings and Debates of the 90th Congress; Bill–S. 510 (Jan. 18, 1967) (noting that the specific provision
applicable to groups was added to “close the loophole that now exists which allows a syndicate, where no member
owns more than 10 percent, to escape the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act”).
116 The operative term “after acquiring” in Section 13(d)(1) makes the application of Section 13(d) contingent upon
the existence of an acquisition. Determining that an acquisition has occurred is thus necessary to establish the
application of Section 13(d).
70
Congress did not define the term “acquisition.” When the Commission proposed the
predecessor to the current Rule 13d-5(a),
117 it made clear that purchases would not be the
exclusive means of making an acquisition and deemed “certain persons who become beneficial
owners of securities to have acquired such securities,” even if such person “had not intended, and
had taken no action, to become a beneficial owner.”118 The Commission also adopted Rule 13d5(b) to address situations in which the factual record does not establish the existence of an
acquisition attributable to a group. Following Rule 13d-5(b)’s adoption, an acquisition by a
group could thus be “deemed” to occur even in the absence of an associated market-based
purchase or other transaction, as could be the case when a group is formed for the exclusive
purpose of voting.
119 Given that the acquisition which triggers the reporting obligation must be

“[d]onees, executors, trustees and legatees who become beneficial owners will be ‘deemed’ to have acquired such
securities, even though such persons had not so intended and had taken no action to become beneficial owners”).
119 See Adoption of Beneficial Ownership Disclosure Requirements, Release No. 34-13291 (Feb. 24, 1977) [42 FR
12342 (Mar. 3, 1977)] (adopting Rule 13d-6(b), the predecessor to current Rule 13d-5(b)); Filing and Disclosure
Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Release No. 34-14692 (Apr. 21, 1978) [43 FR 18484 (Apr. 28,
1978)] (redesignating Rule 13d-6(b) as current Rule 13d-5(b)). In proposing Rule 13d-6(b), the Commission was
acting partly in response to an appellate court ruling issued in connection with private litigation. The appellate court
found that it was unnecessary “for a group to acquire additional securities if their combined holdings, upon
formation of the group, were more than five percent of the class” for purpose of Section 13(d). See GAF Corp. v.
Milstein, 453 F. 2d 709 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied 400 U.S. 910 (1972). The Milstein group was an informal
arrangement in which the individual members were not bound to vote their shares as would be the case if
participating in a stock pool. The alleged group also never had an enforceable right to vote. GAF Corporation
asserted that certain acts should be considered evidence of a conspiracy, but the evidence did not show any
additional purchases. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that formation of a group of shareholders alone,
where their aggregate holdings exceed 10% of a particular class of securities, and where no further acquisitions are
intended by the membership of the group, still required compliance with Section 13(d). In so holding, the Second
Circuit refused to follow the ruling in Bath Industries, Inc. v. Blot, 427 F.2d 97 (7th Cir. 1970) where the Seventh
Circuit held that a group owning in excess of 10% of a class of securities must file only when further acquisitions
were contemplated. Recognizing that informal associations could be subjected to reporting obligations upon mere
formation, the Seventh Circuit adopted an “additional purchase” rule. Even identification of the precise date of the
alleged group formation as the Second Circuit instructed the district court to find upon remand, however, would not
71
made by a single person, acquisitions occurring before the date of group formation are not
considered “acquisitions” of beneficial ownership that could trigger a filing obligation. The
requisite acquisition needed to satisfy the statutory element “after acquiring,” therefore, must
occur contemporaneously with, or subsequent to, group formation. Without evidence that an
acquisition attributable to the group has occurred, the filing deadline for a Schedule 13D also
cannot be established under Section 13(d)(1) and corresponding Rule 13d-1(a). To address this
concern, the Commission proposed that an acquisition was “deemed” to occur if two or more
persons agreed to act together for purposes of acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities of
the issuer. In adopting Rule 13d-5, the Commission explained it was “defining acquisition” and
that the new provision “deems the formation of certain groups of persons for the purpose of
acquiring, holding or disposing of securities to be an acquisition which may trigger the reporting
requirements of section 13(d), even though the group has not made any purchase or other
acquisition subsequent to its formation.”120 The new rule therefore provided the Commission
with a mechanism by which it could attribute an acquisition to the group for purposes of not only
satisfying the “after acquiring” element of Section 13(d)(1), but also designating a date of
“acquisition” needed to commence the 10-day filing deadline for the initial Schedule 13D.121

then have determined whether an acquisition occurred that subjected the group to regulation under Section 13(d) or
the latest date by which the Schedule 13D could have been timely filed.
120 Adoption of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements, Release No. 34-13291 (Feb. 24, 1977) [42 FR 12342
(Mar. 3, 1977)].
121 While the adopting release for Rule 13d-6(b) acknowledges the Commission was providing “more objective
standards” to help determine the reporting obligation of groups under Section 13(d), it qualified such statement by
indicating that the standards were being provided only for “certain purposes” rather than in every instance.
Adoption of Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements, Release No. 34-13291 (Feb. 24, 1977) [42 FR 12342 at
12342 (Mar. 3, 1977)]. The Commission’s regulatory objective should be read in the context of the overall impetus
for the initial 1975 rule proposal, which did not propose to define the term “group.” The Commission further
explained at adoption of Rule 13d-6(b) in 1977 that it had previously published, on August 25, 1975, its “Proposals
Relating to Disclosure of Beneficial Owners and Holders of Record of Voting Securities.” As set forth therein, the
Commission’s 1975 ownership proposals, if adopted, would have “deemed certain persons, including members of a
72
Given that the term “group” is not defined under Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3),
investors, issuers and courts historically have considered the circumstances under which two or
more persons must operate in order to be found to have formed a group.122 Notwithstanding that
the regulatory framework does not require proof of an agreement between two or more persons
as a prerequisite to establishing the existence of a group, some courts, in assessing group
formation, consider an agreement among group members to be a necessary element.123
In rendering opinions regarding group formation, some courts have suggested that a
group can only be formed if an agreement exists among its purported members. 124 These cases

group, who become beneficial owners of securities through non-purchase transactions to have ‘acquired’ such
securities.” Id. at 12343.
122 In Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3), Congress identified, but did not define, four associations through which
collective action may be taken by two or more persons that potentially could subject them to regulation under
Sections 13(d) and 13(g) as a single person. In specifying “partnership, limited partnership, syndicate,” Congress
expressly referenced three types of groupings of persons that, like the term “group,” are similarly undefined. To the
extent two or more persons could not be found to have “act[ed] as a partnership, limited partnership [or] syndicate,”
such persons still could be found under the statutes to be jointly operating as any “other group.” The reference to
“group,” therefore, is simply designed to serve as a general classification inclusive of the three specific, named types
of associations, and when combined with the term “other,” renders the term “other group” but one of four types of
associations identified by Congress which are susceptible to being regulated as a single person under Section 13(d)
or 13(g).
123 For example, in CSX Corporation v. Children’s Inv. Fund Mgmt. (UK) LLP, 562 F. Supp. 2d 511 (S.D.N.Y.
2008), the district court referred to a “requisite agreement” when offering an analytical framework to be applied in
assessing whether or not a group had been formed, and cited to Hallwood Realty Partners, L.P. v. Gotham Partners,
L.P., 95 F. Supp. 2d 169, 176 (S.D.N.Y 2000), aff’d, 286 F.3d 613 in support of this proposition.
124 One early court decision that predates the adoption of Rule 13d-5(b) found that a group had been formed earlier
than reported and opined that “absent an agreement between [the defendants] a ‘group’ would not exist.” Corenco
Corp. v. Schiavone & Sons, Inc., 488 F.2d 207, 217 (2d Cir. 1973). Similarly, another court decision cited the
necessity of “sift[ing] through the record to determine whether there [was] sufficient direct or circumstantial
evidence to support the inference of a formal or informal understanding.” Wellman v. Dickinson, 682 F.2d 355, 363
(2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied sub. nom. Dickinson v. SEC, 460 U.S. 1069 (1983). The court ultimately determined
that “direct and circumstantial evidence supports [its] finding of an agreement between” the alleged group members.
Id. In another decision, the court reasoned that it was “not compelled to play ostrich in the face of the strong
circumstantial evidence demonstrating the existence of an agreement among [the defendants] . . . . It would require a
degree of naivete unbecoming to this Court to believe that the various activities of defendants were not the product
of an agreement among the group but, rather, were merely coincidences.” Champion Parts Rebuilders, Inc. v
Cormier Corp., 661 F. Supp. 825, 850 (N.D.Ill. 1987) (citations omitted). The court based its factual finding that an
agreement existed on evidence indicating: (a) a common plan and goal; (b) a pattern of parallel and continued
purchases over a relatively short and essentially concurrent time period; (c) correlation of defendants' activities and
73
appear to reflect such courts’ attempts to find a workable means of administering the Section
13(d) regulatory framework and making related determinations about when a group may be
found to exist under the statute. In addition, some courts have construed the language of Rule
13d-5(b)(1), which provides that a group is formed if an agreement to act together has been
reached for one of four purposes, as governing group formation in every instance as opposed to
discrete instances. 125 These decisions suggest that a plaintiff must prove, and by extension, a
court must affirm, the presence of an agreement for purposes of satisfying the legal standards in
Rule 13d-5(b)(1).
2. The Commission’s View of Group Formation
Under a plain reading of Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3), an agreement is not a necessary
element of group formation. The text of Rule 13d-5(b), along with the title of Rule 13d-5, also
does not indicate that Rule 13d-5(b) was intended to serve as the exclusive definition of the term
“group.” Rule 13d-5(b) provides a standard applicable only for purposes of deeming an
acquisition to have occurred where none otherwise exists. Therefore, the Commission is not
required to invoke Rule 13d-5, and by extension, first establish that group members have an

intercommunications, largely through their common agent; and (d) claims of shareholder support at the meeting with
the corporation. Id.
125 For example, the Second Circuit, finding that the district court in the above mentioned CSX Corporation matter
did not make sufficient findings to permit appellate review of a group violation of Section 13(d), stated: “on remand
the District Court will have to make findings as to whether the Defendants formed a group for the purpose of
‘acquiring, holding, voting or disposing,’ 17 CFR 240.13d-5(b)(1) of [an issuer’s] shares owned outright.” CSX
Corp. v. Children’s Inv. Fund Mgmt., 2011 WL 2750913, at *4 (2d Cir. July 18, 2011). An earlier Second Circuit
opinion stated, “the key inquiry in the present case is whether [the defendants] ‘agreed to act together for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of’ [an issuer’s] common stock. 17 CFR 240.13d-5(b)(1).”
Morales v. Quintel Ent., Inc., 249 F.3d I 15 (2d Cir. 2001). In a ruling that concluded the evidence did not establish
the existence of a group, a district court, which acknowledged Rule 13d-5(b) when outlining the applicable
regulatory framework, found that the plaintiff’s complaint “d[id] not sufficiently allege an agreed-upon common
purpose.” Roth v. Jennings, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4266, 2006 WL 278135 at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2006). On
appeal, however, the Second Circuit criticized the district court for ascribing undue weight to the defendants’ use of
a disclaimer in public filings that they were not a group and found that the district court consequently “gave no
recognition to the terms of §13(d)(3) and Rule 13d-5(b)(1).” Roth v. Jennings, 489 F.3d 499, 512 (2d Cir. 2007).
74
agreement to act together as a precondition to asserting that a group exists. Accordingly, the
Commission is not precluded from imputing acquisitions to the group through other means, such
as physical evidence or reliance upon Rule 13d-5(a), which provides that a person (including a
group) is deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership when it becomes a beneficial owner by
purchase or otherwise. The existence of an agreement between two or more persons to act
together for at least one of the four purposes specified in the rule text is thus a sufficient, but not
a necessary, condition for group formation.
Interpreting Rule 13d-5(b) as the exclusive definition of a group also would run counter
to the purpose and otherwise impede application of Sections 13(d) and 13(g).
126 Rule 13d-5(b)
applies only when the aggregate amount of beneficial ownership held by group members exceeds
5% of a covered class on the date on which the group members enter into an agreement. If the
beneficial ownership is 5% or less of a covered class on that date, or the ownership held is not in
a covered class because Section 12 registration is not yet effective or otherwise, no statutory
coverage exists and Regulation 13D-G does not apply. Consequently, if Rule 13d-5(b) were
administered as the exclusive definition of group, there would be no requirement for such groups
to report their holdings after their beneficial ownership exceeded 5% of a covered class, even if
such groups were to make considerable post-formation acquisitions and ultimately take control
of an issuer. Such a reading of Rule 13d-5(b) would produce the equivalent of an exemption
from Section 13(d) for a person (i.e., the group) that otherwise may make future non-exempt
acquisitions that would result in the beneficial ownership attributable to the group exceeding 5%

126 For example, if the Commission were to construe Rule 13d-5(b)(1) as the exclusive definition of the term
“group,” and thus make an “agreement” a necessary element, that would directly conflict with the statutory language
and narrow the circumstances in which Sections 13(d) and 13(g) could apply.

of a covered class. There is no indication that this was the Commission’s intention when it
adopted Rule 13d-5(b).127
Furthermore, there is no indication that Congress intended for the analysis of whether or
not a group had formed to be dependent upon the existence of an express or implied agreement
among two or more persons.
128 Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) are devoid of any reference to the
term “agree” or “agreement.” The use of “any,” “understanding,” “relationship” and
“arrangement” in the associated regulatory text of Rule 13d-3(a) also points to a recognition that
concerted action need not be formalized in an agreement or otherwise expressed.
129 Section
13(d)(3), given the operative “act as” standard, encompasses not only agreements in the classic
contractual “offer” and “acceptance” sense of the term130 but also pooling arrangements, whether

127 When proposing Rule 13d-5(b), the Commission neither framed the rule as a proposed definition of “group” nor
solicited comment on the sufficiency or any limitations of any such definition. Moreover, the proposed rule text was
devoid of any reference to the term “group.” See Disclosure of Corporate Ownership, Release No. 34-11616 (Aug.
25, 1975) [40 FR 42212 (Sept. 11, 1975)].
128 According to the legislative history, members of Congress contemplated that the beneficial ownership reporting
threshold—which was first enacted as more than 10% of a covered class, but currently is 5% of a covered class—
could be bypassed by two or more persons acting in concert in furtherance of a common purpose or goal with each
person individually holding an unreportable level of beneficial ownership. Both the House and Senate Reports
accompanying the bill reflect an effort to prevent circumvention of the reporting threshold in this situation with the
inclusion of the provision that became Section 13(d)(3). Those reports stated that Section 13(d)(3) “would prevent a
group of persons [w]ho seek to pool their voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer from evading the
provisions of the statute because no one individual owns more than 10 percent of the securities.” S. Rep. No. 550,
90th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1967); H.R. Rep. No. 1711, 90th Cong. 2d Sess. 8-9 (1968), Reprinted in (1968) U.S. Code
Cong. & Admin. News. 2811, 2818. The reports further stated that “[t]he group would be deemed to have become
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 10 percent of a class of securities at the time [t]hey agreed
to act in concert.” Id. As such, the reports noted that Section 13(d)(3) “is designed to obtain full disclosure of the
identity of any person or group obtaining the benefits of ownership [b]y reason of any contract, understanding,
relationship, agreement or other arrangement.” Id.
129 Congress sought to make visible surreptitious purchases executed by persons or entities that were not only not
incorporated, but also operating without a formal alliance. The legislation was thus drafted to capture “informal
associations” that otherwise were not subject to having their joint activities disclosed. See Full Disclosure of
Corporate Equity Ownership and in Corporate Takeover Bids: Hearing on S. 510 Before the Subcomm. on
Securities of the S. Comm. on Banking and Currency, 90th Cong. 1 (1967). Because a group is deemed a single
“person” once the standards of Section 13(d)(3) or 13(g)(3) have been met, that “person” may be considered a
beneficial owner under Rule 13d-3(a) regardless of the absence of any contract or agreement.
130 Section 13(d)(3) was “designed to obtain full disclosure of the identity of any . . . group obtaining the benefits of
ownership of securities by reason of any contract, understanding, relationship, agreement or other arrangement.” S.

formal or informal, written or unwritten.131 Congress neither added a state of mind element into
Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) nor specified that two or more persons must “act as” a group
pursuant to an agreement. If the term “agreement” were read into Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3)
as if it were an unintentionally omitted term, application of Section 13(d) or 13(g) also would be
limited to only a subset of persons who otherwise “act as a group” within the meaning of
Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) instead of all persons who act as a group as expressly mandated.
Whether or not a group exists is dependent upon the facts and circumstances.132
Recognizing that two or more persons may take concerted action informally and without
memorializing their intentions in writing, the Commission has relied upon circumstantial
evidence instead of an agreement to establish that two or more persons combined in furtherance
of a common objective.133 A contrary approach or interpretation would elevate form over

Rep. No. 550, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1967); H.R. Rep. No. 1711, 90th Cong. 2d Sess. 8-9 (1968), Reprinted in
(1968) U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News. 2811, 2818. During a hearing, an individual testifying before the Senate
(who was a member of a corporation’s management) observed that in the then-unregulated market of takeovers for
corporate control, “it [was] possible . . . for a group of people who [were] informally associated to each acquire less
than 10 percent of the stock without having to report their acquisitions even though they have more than 10 percent
as a group.” Full Disclosure of Corporate Equity Ownership and in Corporate Takeover Bids: Hearing on S. 510
Before the Subcomm. on Securities of the S. Comm. on Banking and Currency, 90th Cong. 1 (1967) (statement of
Herbert F. Kahler, Secretary and General Counsel, International Silver Co.).
131 Some courts and the Commission have not superimposed the term “agreement” into the legal standards governing
the reporting of beneficial ownership by groups. See SEC v. Levy, 706 F. Supp. 61 (D.D.C. 1989) (“In order to find
that a ‘group’ exists under Section 13(d)(3), a court must find that two or more people have formed a combination in
support of a common objective.”); see also In the Matter of John A. Carley, Release No. 34-50695 (Nov. 18, 2004)
(“A group need not be formally organized, nor memorialize its intentions in writing. . . . All that is required is that
its members combine in furtherance of a common objective.”).
132 Group activity may be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence, SEC v. Savoy, 587 F.2d 1149 at 1162, such as:
(1) the presence of a common plan or goal, Fin. Gen. Bankshares, Inc. v. Lance, 1978 WL 1082, at *9 (D.D.C.
1978); (2) “considerable dissatisfaction” with certain officers and a “desire to reduce” those officers’ role in
company management, Id. at *10; (3) strategy meetings with, among others, attorneys, Levy, 706 F. Supp. at 70; (4)
a pattern of coordinated stock purchases, Hallwood Realty Partners, LP v. Gotham Partners, LP, 286 F.3d 613, 618
(2d Cir. 2002); (5) the solicitation of others to join the group, Wellman, 682 F.2d at 363-364; and (6) the existence of
communications between and among group members. Gen. Aircraft Corp. v. Lampert, 556 F.2d 90, 95 (1st Cir.
1977).

substance and make the regulation of groups in the beneficial ownership context wholly
dependent upon evidence proving the existence of an agreement. The purpose of the statute
would be frustrated, and a burden not intended by Congress would be placed upon any party
alleging the existence of a group, including the Commission.134
The absence of a need to prove that a group made an acquisition for purposes of reporting
under Section 13(g), in itself, supports our view that the existence of a group is not dependent
upon application of Rule 13d-5(b), and by extension, whether such persons had an agreement.
The absence of the “after acquiring” element in Section 13(g)(1) supports the view that groups
may be subject to reporting obligations under Section 13(d), just as they are under Section 13(g),
without reference to Rule 13d-5(b). No regulatory purpose would be served by concluding that
an agreement among members is a prerequisite to the imposition of a reporting obligation under
Section 13(d)(1) but not Section 13(g)(1). Under the current regulatory framework, if an
agreement does not exist or cannot be proven, and no acquisitions can otherwise be imputed to
the group, Section 13(g) will still apply to require reporting by the group if the collective amount
of beneficial ownership held by the group members exceeds 5% at the end of the calendar year.
3. Proposed Amendments
a. Proposed Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(i) and (b)(2)(i)
Our proposal would amend Rule 13d-5 to track the statutory text of Sections 13(d)(3) and
(g)(3) and specify that two or more persons who “act as” a group for purposes of acquiring,
holding or disposing securities are treated as a group. Specifically, Rule 13d-5(b)(1) would be
redesignated as Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(i) and would be revised to, among other things, remove the
reference to an agreement between two or more persons and instead indicate that when two or
more persons act as a group under Section 13(d)(3), the group will be deemed to have acquired

134 See Bath Industries, Inc. v. Blot, 427 F.2d 97, 110 (7th Cir. 1970).
78
beneficial ownership of all of the equity securities of a covered class beneficially owned by each
of the group’s members as of the date on which the group is formed. In addition, proposed new
Rule 13d-5(b)(2)(i) would contain nearly identical language, with conforming changes to address
circumstances in which two or more persons act as a group under Section 13(g)(3) and the group
is deemed to become the beneficial owner of all of the equity securities of a covered class
beneficially owned by each of the group’s members as of the date on which the group is formed.
These amendments would make clear that the determination as to whether two or more
persons are acting as a group does not depend solely on the presence of an express agreement
and that, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, concerted actions by two or more
persons for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities of an issuer are sufficient
to constitute the formation of a group.135 By revising Rule 13d-5(b) as we propose, we intend to
eliminate any potential for the rule to be misconstrued and consequently used as a basis to
narrow the application of Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) to: (1) two or more persons who first
“agree” to act as a group, instead of two or more persons who “act as” a group as expressly
codified in these statutory provisions; and then (2) only an additional subset of those such groups
whose beneficial ownership exceeds 5% on the date of an agreement.
b. Proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii)
In addition, given that a Schedule 13D filing may affect the market for an issuer’s
securities, information that a person will make a Schedule 13D filing in the near future can be

135 The Commission, in adopting Rule 13d-5(b)(1), indicated that it viewed the term “holding” as subsuming the
term “voting,” but nevertheless expressly referenced the term “voting” for the avoidance of doubt. See Filing and
Disclosure Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Release No. 34-14692 (Apr. 21, 1978) [43 FR 18484 at
18492 (Apr. 28, 1978)].
79
material. 136 Under certain circumstances, the person that incurs or will incur such a filing
obligation may be incentivized to share that information with other investors. For example, a
large blockholder may be planning to commence a future campaign to challenge or unseat
directors serving on the board of the issuer of the covered class and seek support of its still
undisclosed plan.137 By privately sharing this material information (i.e., the fact that the
blockholder is or will be required to make a Schedule 13D filing) in advance of the public filing
deadline with a goal of inducing a change in the voting electorate or strengthening a relationship,
the blockholder may engender support of, and improve the likelihood of success regarding, any
future changes proposed to the issuer. Similarly, by sharing such material information with other
investors positioned to act on the information, the blockholder may incentivize those investors to
acquire shares in the covered class before such filing is made.
138 Such incentive would be based
on the other investors’ expectation of an increase in the price of the covered class once the
market reacts to the Schedule 13D filing.
These activities raise a question as to whether those investors “act as” a “group for the

purpose of acquiring” the covered class within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3).139 They also
raise investor protection concerns. For example, any near-term gains made by these other
investors attributable to this asymmetric information may come at the expense of uninformed
shareholders who sell at prices reflective of the status quo.
140 Even though the demand to acquire
shares in the covered class may increase as a direct result of the blockholder’s communications,
and in turn increase the prices at which such selling shareholders exit, such prices may be
discounted in comparison to the price selling shareholders would have achieved had the
information about the impending Schedule 13D filing been public. Consequently, this
informational imbalance may result in opportunistic purchases benefitting a favored few. 141
To provide clarity on this issue, enhance investor confidence and promote accurate price
discovery in the capital markets, we are proposing to amend Rule 13d-5 to include a provision,
which would be codified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), that states that a person who shares information
about an upcoming Schedule 13D filing that such person will be required to make, to the extent
this information is not yet public and communicated with the purpose of causing others to make
purchases, and a person who subsequently purchases the issuer’s securities based on this
information will be deemed to have a formed a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3).
Proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) further provides that the group formed on the basis of such
concerted action will be deemed to acquire beneficial ownership in the covered class. This

139 This question arises regardless of whether such other investors would be independently subject to, and thus incur
a stand-alone reporting obligation under, Section 13(d)(1). Under Section 13(d)(3), however, two or more persons
may be treated as a single person only if the beneficial ownership collectively held exceeds 5% of the covered class.
140 See infra Sections III.A and III.C.3.

81
acquisition by the group, which occurs by operation of Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii), would trigger
application of Section 13(d)(1), and in turn, establish the filing deadline for the group’s
disclosure statement on Schedule 13D. The proposed amendment would thus help ensure that
appropriate disclosures under Section 13(d) are made in these and similar circumstances. 142
We believe this proposed rule change is consistent with the purpose of Section 13(d).
Section 13(d)(3) was designed to prevent circumvention of Section 13(d). As noted above, under
Section 13(d)(3), a group may become subject to regulation even in the absence of any express
or implied agreement to act together for the purpose of acquiring a covered class. For example,
if a large blockholder shares non-public information about its anticipated obligation to file a
Schedule 13D, as would be the case if a tipper were to share its intention to accumulate a stake
that would trigger such a filing obligation, and the person who receives such information
subsequently makes a purchase based on that information, such information-sharing and
purchasing activity is sufficient to satisfy the statutory standards within Section 13(d)(3) to the
extent the information was shared with the purpose of causing such additional purchases to be
made. While the final determination as to whether two or more persons “act as” a group for this
purpose ultimately will depend upon the specific facts and circumstances, the advantages
inherent to this mutually beneficial relationship between the tipper and the tippee are selfevident. The large blockholder would have shared non-public, potentially market-moving

142 Proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii), if adopted, would provide that the conduct specified in the rule is sufficient to find
that a group had been formed under Section 13(d)(3) and, at the same time, deem that group to have made the
acquisition necessary to trigger application of Section 13(d)(1). The proposed rule would serve as an additional, not
exclusive, means of establishing that the tipper and tippee formed a group that made an acquisition subject to
Section 13(d). The proposed rule would not supersede or replace the existing regulatory provisions under which the
tipper-tippee could become subject to Section 13(d). Thus, the Commission would not need to invoke Rule 13d5(b)(1)(ii) when seeking to enforce violations in the context of every tipper-tippee relationship, but instead could
assert other bases for finding that two or more such persons acted as a group for the purpose of acquiring a covered
class.
82
information concerning an impending Schedule 13D filing obligation. The blockholder benefits
by virtue of the subsequent acquisition of shares by the other investors, which may support or
contribute to an increase in the value of the blockholder’s investment in the covered class. In
addition, the blockholder meaningfully contributes to a relationship, and creates the potential for
reciprocal behavior. Such reciprocity could, in turn, prompt additional concerted action that will
further implicate the statute.143 Those investors, acting on the information shared by the
blockholder, also benefit by capitalizing on an opportunity to acquire the covered class at a
comparative “discount” relative to the price they presumably would have paid had more timely
public disclosure of the sensitive information in their possession been made. Consequently, in
our view, the tipping arrangement described above falls within the scope of activity Congress
sought to regulate when it enacted Section 13(d)(3).
Under proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii), the group will be deemed to have acquired
beneficial ownership of the securities of any market participant with whom the large blockholder
has communicated material information regarding its impending filing obligation on the earliest
date on which the acquisition by the recipient (or recipients, as the case may be) of the material
information occurs.144 The existence of this acquisition will not alter the blockholder’s initial
filing obligation in respect of its acquisition of beneficial ownership in excess of 5% of the
covered class. Rather, that person will now be obligated to acknowledge the existence of the
group under Item 2 of the cover page of Schedule 13D, and provide any other required

143 See John C. Coffee, Jr. and Darius Palia, supra note 19, at 596 and n.173 (explaining that “norms of reciprocity
characterize many areas of commercial life” and “[f]or prudential reasons, hedge funds may prefer to share the gains
among themselves by using an organizational structure that unites a number of funds into a loosely knit organization
(i.e., the ‘wolf pack’) that may acquire 25% or more of the target” and noting that “[a]lthough the lead hedge fund
does not fully capture all the gains obtainable in the transaction it leads, it reduces its risk and may receive reciprocal
treatment from other hedge funds that later invite it to join it to their ‘wolf packs’”).
144 The term “market participant” is used in this release to refer to any investor in or trader of a covered class, as
determined in this release. The term has been used in order to account for the foreseeable possibility that a large
blockholder may need to consult with persons who are not investors or traders, such as outside counsel, broker
dealers, filing agents and others in connection with having to make its initial Schedule 13D filing.
83
disclosures as a group member. If other group members make purchases later than the first date
on which the blockholder is deemed to have formed a group with another person, proposed Rule
13d-5(b)(1)(iii), discussed below, would operate to deem the group to have acquired any
additional shares acquired by any such persons who are considered group members after the date
of group formation. Under Rule 13d-1(k), group members have the option of jointly filing a
single Schedule 13D or, alternatively, independently filing a Schedule 13D that identifies all
members of the group.
No term within proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) prohibits the blockholder from making
additional purchases in the covered class or communicating the existence of the filing obligation
to other shareholders. As such, the large blockholder and the other investors are free to acquire a
larger position in the covered class during the period that remains before the required beneficial
ownership report discloses the existence of the group. While the impact of the proposed rule
may reduce the number of members within, and beneficial ownership initially held by, a group
formed under the described tipping arrangement, or eliminate the practice altogether, we believe
the proposed rule is appropriate in light of the possibility for coordinated acquisitions without
compliance with Section 13(d). We believe that adding a provision directly addressing the
tipping arrangement described above would advance the policy purposes of Section 13(d).
c. Proposed Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii)
Groups may form at a time when a class of equity securities is not yet registered under
Section 12 or the aggregate beneficial ownership held by the membership in the group on the
date of its formation is 5% or below of a covered class. Expressly capturing post-formation
acquisitions of beneficial ownership by group members therefore can become important for
purposes of: assessing whether a group intentionally tried to evade the reporting process;
determining whether an amendment was due for a pre-existing Schedule 13D filing; and
evaluating the availability of the Section 13(d)(6)(B) exemption. For example, imputing post-
84
formation acquisitions to a group by rule would make clear that acquisitions by group members
that collectively exceed the 2% exemptive threshold over a 12-month period are attributable to
the group, thereby resulting in the group becoming ineligible to report pursuant to Section 13(g)
and triggering a filing obligation under Section 13(d).
145 The 12-month measurement period
therefore extends into the time period where a beneficial owner, including a group, held an
amount of beneficial ownership below the statutory threshold or where the group formed on a
date when the class of equity was not registered under Section 12.146
Absent an express provision that would treat post-formation acquisitions of beneficial
ownership by group members as acquisitions by the group, the Commission or other affected
parties must prove the acquisition is attributable to the group. For example, if the Commission
invoked Rule 13d-5(a), it would have to establish that the group “became” a beneficial owner of
more shares and thus made an acquisition within the meaning of that rule. To help ensure that
acquisitions made by a group member after the date of group formation are attributed to the
group once the collective beneficial ownership among group members exceeds 5% of a covered
class, and reduce the Commission’s evidentiary burden, we propose to amend Rule 13d-5 to
expressly impute such acquisitions to the group. Proposed new Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(iii) would
provide that a group under Section 13(d)(3) will be deemed to have acquired beneficial
ownership of equity securities of a covered class if any member of the group becomes the
beneficial owner of additional equity securities of such covered class after the date of the group’s
formation. Proposed new Rule 13d-5(b)(2)(ii) would contain nearly identical language, with

145 Section 13(d)(6)(B) takes into account all acquisitions that occurred during the preceding twelve months.
146 The Commission has indicated that the 2% exemption operates on “a rolling twelve-month basis.” Filing and
Disclosure Requirements Relating to Beneficial Ownership, Release No. 34-17353 (Dec. 4, 1980) [45 FR 81556 at
81557 (Dec. 11, 1980)]. In other words, for an acquisition to be exempt under Section 13(d)(6)(B), “it must, when
taken together with all other acquisitions of beneficial ownership by the same person of securities of the same class
during the preceding twelve months, not exceed two percent of the class.” Id.
85
conforming changes to address circumstances in which a member of a group under Section
13(g)(3) becomes the beneficial owner of additional equity securities of a covered class after the
date of the group’s formation.
d. Proposed Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(2)(iii)
We also are proposing amendments to Rule 13d-5 to carve out from the purview of
proposed Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii) intra-group transfers of equity securities of a
covered class. Specifically, proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(iv) would provide that a group under
Section 13(d)(3) will not be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership in a covered class if a
member of the group becomes the beneficial owner of additional equity securities in such
covered class through a sale by, or transfer from, another member of the group. Proposed new
Rule 13d-5(b)(2)(iii) would contain nearly identical language, with conforming changes to
address circumstances in which a member of a group under Section 13(g)(3) becomes the
beneficial owner of additional equity securities in a covered class through a sale by, or transfer
from, another member of the group.
e. Proposed Amendment to the Title of Rule 13d-5
To further align Rule 13d-5 with Section 13(d)(1), we also propose to amend the title of
the rule to “Acquisitions of beneficial ownership” to remove the potential implication that
Section 13(d) and Rule 13d-1(a) could only apply if a person made an actual acquisition of
securities. Under Section 13(d)(1), a person becomes subject to a reporting obligation “after
acquiring” beneficial ownership, which determination may or may not include an actual
acquisition of securities based on whether a person is a beneficial owner under Rule 13d-3. We
also are proposing conforming amendments to Rule 13d-5(a) to replace the references to an
“acqui[sition] of securities” with references to an “acqui[sition] of beneficial ownership.”
f. Proposed Redesignation of Current Rule 13d-5(b)(2)
86
Finally, for the avoidance of doubt or confusion as to the regulatory purpose Rule 13d-5
is intended to serve, and to reinforce its operation as a provision that governs acquisitions of
beneficial ownership, we propose to relocate Rule 13d-5(b)(2) to neighboring Rule 13d-6, titled
“Exemption of certain acquisitions,” and redesignate it as new Rule 13d-6(b). No substantive
changes would be made to the text of the rule. That amendment is discussed in more detail in
Section II.D below.
Request for Comment
54. Should we amend Rule 13d-5 to add new Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(i) and (b)(2)(i), as proposed?
Rather than amending the rule as proposed to affirm that an express or implied agreement
is not needed to subject a group to reporting under Section 13(d) or 13(g), should we
instead issue a Commission interpretation that reiterates this point?
55. Should we amend Rule 13d-5 to add new Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii), as proposed? Does the
current regulatory framework sufficiently address such activity? Would the possible
imposition of a Schedule 13D filing obligation adequately remediate the behavior we are
seeking to address? Are there any changes to proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) that we
should consider, such as further clarification to address situations where the non-public
information about the Schedule 13D filing is shared by an employee who is not authorized
to do so?
56. Should we amend Rule 13d-5 to add new Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii), as
proposed? Alternatively, should additional acquisitions made by group members after the
date of group formation under Section 13(d) be exempted, or should additional persons
under Section 13(g) be exempted from regulation as a group, and if so, what would be the
grounds upon which such exemptions could be granted?
57. Should we amend Rule 13d-5 to add new Rules 13d-5(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(2)(iii), as
proposed?
87
58. Instead of amending Rule 13d-5 as proposed, should we propose a definition of the term
“group” and, if so, how should the term be defined?
59. Should we propose a rule or amendments to existing rules that would require groups to
report exclusively on Schedule 13D, and if so, why should groups not be able to avail
themselves of reporting on Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule 13D as they do today? For
example, Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(K) identifies a group as being among the qualified
institutions eligible to report on Schedule 13G in lieu of Schedule 13D provided that every
member of the group is a qualified institution. Should this provision be rescinded and
other revisions be made to ensure that groups would be ineligible to qualify as QIIs or
Passive Investors that report beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G?
60. Have shareholders suffered quantifiable harm as a result of any weakness in the current
regulatory framework as applied to groups, and if so, would new rules or amendments
beyond what we have already proposed prevent such harm caused by undisclosed group
activity from recurring?
61. Is certain group activity going unreported under the current regulatory framework because
it does not involve acquiring, holding or disposing of a covered class, and if so, what
additional rule proposals or modifications could be made to address such activity?
62. Do instances exist in which shareholders in a covered class were harmed as a result of the
tipping arrangements described above, and if so, could such harm be quantified? To the
extent any such shareholder harm has occurred, please explain how such harm occurred.
63. Would Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) unduly chill communications between shareholders and
market participants, such as investment advisers? If so, what modifications to the
proposed rule should we consider? For example, should application of the rule be
conditioned on the recipient of the tip intending to coordinate with the tipper or making its
purchases in reliance on the non-public information that the tipper provided so as to avoid
88
a scenario in which such recipient is unwittingly deemed a member of a group simply by
virtue of the tipper’s independent communications or actions?
64. Given that Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) would operate and apply in addition to, and not to the
exclusion of, Section 13(d)(3),
147 should the Commission issue guidance about the facts
and circumstances under which it would find that two or more persons “act as a group”
under Section 13(d)(3) in the context of a tipper-tippee relationship or otherwise?
65. Should the scope of proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) be expanded to include the group
formation standards under Section 13(g)(3) as well, and if so, why? Would other
investors be incentivized to take a position in a covered class upon learning that a
Schedule 13G filing was expected to be made by an Exempt Investor? For example, have
any individual investors or groups filed a Schedule 13G as an Exempt Investor while also
advocating for change without disclosure given the absence of an analogue to Item 4 of
Schedule 13D or requirement under Item 10 of Schedule 13G for an Exempt Investor to
certify as to its passivity? Similarly, should the scope of proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii) be
expanded to cover Schedule 13G filings made by a group of QIIs or Passive Investors
given that such groups—like Schedule 13D filers—still will have made an acquisition
subject to Section 13(d)?
66. For purposes of this release, “market participant” means any investor in or trader of a
covered class. 148 Should any modifications be made to our interpretation of the term
“market participant”? Alternatively, should we adopt a definition of the term “market
participant” in Regulation 13D-G? If so, should Regulation 13D-G be amended to include
a provision dedicated to providing defined terms used throughout the regulation?

D. Proposed Amendments to Rule 13d-6 to Create Certain Exemptions
We are proposing a series of amendments to Rule 13d-6 to reorganize the rule and
exempt certain circumstances from resulting in a person being deemed to have acquired
beneficial ownership of, or otherwise to beneficially own, equity securities of a covered class for
purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g). Specifically, we are proposing to amend Rule 13d-6 to:
• Redesignate the current text of Rule 13d-6 as Rule 13d-6(a);
• Redesignate the current text of Rule 13d-5(b)(2) as Rule 13d-6(b);
• Add new paragraph (c) to create an exemption from Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) for
certain circumstances in which two or more persons take concerted actions with respect
to an issuer or a covered class; and
• Add new paragraph (d) to create an exemption from Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) for
certain circumstances in which two or more persons enter into an agreement setting forth
the terms of a derivative security.
These proposed amendments are discussed in further detail below.
1. Background
Congress granted the Commission the authority to issue exemptions from the application
of Sections 13(d) and 13(g). The Commission can, under Section 13(d)(6)(D), exempt, by rule,
acquisitions “as not entered into for the purpose of, and not having the effect of, changing or
influencing the control of the issuer or otherwise as not comprehended within the purposes of
[Section 13(d)].” Congress similarly granted the Commission authority under Section 13(g)(6)
to exempt any person or class of persons from Section 13(g) “as it deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.” The Commission exercised
this authority when it adopted Rule 13d-6, which exempts certain acquisitions. Currently, it sets
forth one exemption from Section 13(d) for the acquisition of securities of an issuer by a person
90
who, prior to such acquisition, was a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding
securities of the same class as those acquired, provided that certain conditions are met.
We recognize that our proposal to amend Rule 13d-5, as discussed above, may raise
concerns among investors as to whether their communications and other activities with other
investors would constitute the formation of a group. We also recognize the possibility that
additional exemptions may be warranted to address situations in which beneficial ownership
reporting under Section 13(d) or 13(g) by a group would be unnecessary from an investor
protection standpoint or even contrary to the public interest. Specifically, we are aware that
activity exists among shareholders, investors, holders of derivatives and other market
participants that may, absent an exemption, implicate Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3). For
example, institutional investors or shareholder proponents may wish to communicate and consult
with one another regarding an issuer’s performance or certain corporate policy matters involving
one or more issuers. Subsequently, those investors and proponents may take similar action with
respect to the issuer or its securities, such as engaging directly with the issuer’s management or
coordinating their voting of shares at the issuer’s annual meeting with respect to one or more
company or shareholder proposals.
The beneficial ownership reporting system is not intended to impede communications
among shareholders or between proponents and issuers that are not undertaken with the purpose
or effect of changing or influencing control of an issuer. Accordingly, the regulatory purposes of
Sections 13(d) and 13(g) would not be served by treating investors and proponents under those
circumstances as a single person that “act[s] as” a group by virtue of its “holding” of a covered
class within the meaning of Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3).
Similarly, investors in an equity-based derivative security may need to, in order to
acquire the derivative security, enter into an agreement governing the terms of such instrument
with a financial institution that, in the ordinary course of its business, acts as a counterparty to
91
such investors. To offset any risk exposure to that derivative security, including any obligations
that may arise at settlement, the financial institution may accumulate the reference equity
security in a covered class and hold such reference security for the duration of the agreement.
But for the joint actions of the parties in entering into the agreement, that specific acquisition of
beneficial ownership in the covered class by the financial institution would not have occurred.
As such, entry into such an agreement may implicate Sections 13(d)(3) and (g)(3) because two
persons may be viewed as “act[ing] as” a group given the financial institution’s foreseeable
acquisition of a covered class. Assuming that the investor and the financial institution did not
enter into the agreement with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the
issuer, the regulatory purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g) would not be furthered by treating the
investor and the financial institution as members of a group under Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3)
solely by virtue of their entrance—for strictly commercial purposes and not for purposes of
acquiring, holding or disposing of a covered class—into that agreement.
2. Proposed Amendments
We are proposing amendments to Rule 13d-6 to exempt certain actions taken by two or
more persons from the scope of Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) if those actions do not have the
purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of an issuer and thus are not within the
purpose of Section 13(d).
As an initial matter, we are proposing to redesignate current Rule 13d-6 as Rule 13d-6(a)
to allow for new exemptions to be added as subsequent paragraphs of Rule 13d-6. The text of
current Rule 13d-6 would not be changed in any way.
In light of our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5, we also are proposing to add new
paragraph (c) to Rule 13d-6 to avoid chilling communications among shareholders or impeding
shareholders’ engagement with issuers where those activities are undertaken without the purpose
or effect of changing or influencing control of the issuer (and are not made in connection with or
92
as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect).
149 Proposed Rule 13d-6(c)
would provide that two or more persons will not be deemed to have acquired beneficial
ownership of, or otherwise beneficially own, an issuer’s equity securities as a group solely
because of their concerted actions related to an issuer or its equity securities, including
engagement with one another or the issuer, provided they meet certain conditions. Such
interactions, depending upon the level of coordination and degree to which the persons advocate
in furtherance of a common purpose or goal, could be found to satisfy the “act as” a group
standard under Section 13(d)(3) or 13(g)(3) for the purpose of “holding” a covered class. To
help ensure that the exemption is available only where such persons independently determine to
take concerted actions, the proposed exemption would be available only if such persons are not
directly or indirectly obligated to take such actions (e.g., pursuant to the terms of a cooperation
agreement or joint voting agreement).
In addition, we are proposing to add new paragraph (d) to Rule 13d-6, in light of
proposed new Rule 13d-3(e), to avoid impediments to certain financial institutions’ ability to
conduct their business in the ordinary course. Proposed Rule 13d-6(d) would provide that two or
more persons will not be deemed to have formed a group under Section 13(d)(3) or 13(g)(3)

149 The Commission has previously articulated policy concerns similar to those that underlie this proposed
exemption. For example, in a rulemaking effort in the late 1990s, the Commission took steps to ensure that “the
Section 13(d) reporting obligations [do not] restrict a shareholder’s ability to engage in proxy related activities,”
including their “ability to use the proxy rule exemptions that were adopted in 1992 to facilitate communications
among shareholders.” Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements, Release No. 34-39538 (Jan.
12, 1998) [63 FR 2854 at 2858 (Jan. 16, 1998)]. In adopting those proxy rule exemptions, the Commission noted
that “[t]he purposes of the proxy rules themselves are better served by promoting free discussion, debate and
learning among shareholders and interested persons.” Regulation of Communications Among Shareholders, Release
No. 34-31326 (Oct. 16, 1992) [57 FR 48276 at 48279 (Oct. 22, 1992)]. Finally, as discussed supra note 47, our
proposal, if adopted, would not change the existing standards for determining whether a person is engaging in an
activity that would have the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer. For example, our
proposal would not change the Commission’s existing view that most proxy solicitations in support of a proposal
specifically calling for a change of control of an issuer (e.g., a contested election of directors, a sale of the issuer or
the restructuring of the issuer) would clearly have the purpose and effect of changing or influencing control. See
Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements, Release No. 34-39538 (Jan. 12, 1998) [63 FR 2854
at 2859 (Jan. 16, 1998)]. See also supra note 99 for the definition of “control” under Rule 12b-2 of Regulation 12B.
93
solely by virtue of their entrance into an agreement governing the terms of a derivative security.
This exemption would only be available if the agreement is a bona fide purchase and sale
agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business. Further, the exemption would only be
available if such persons do not enter into the agreement with the purpose or effect of changing
or influencing control of the issuer, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction
having such purpose or effect.
Finally, as noted above, we are proposing to redesignate current Rule 13d-5(b)(2) as new
Rule 13d-6(b). Current Rule 13d-5(b)(2) was first adopted in 1978 as a means to effectively
exempt acquisitions from being attributed to a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)
solely by virtue of concerted actions by QIIs relating to the purchase of equity securities in a
private offering. 150 As such, our proposed placement of this provision, which operates to exempt
an actual purchase transaction by a group from otherwise being treated as an acquisition under
Rule 13d-5(b)(1), into Rule 13d-6, should add to administrative convenience as the provision
would appear alongside another acquisition transaction already so exempted.
Request for Comment
67. Should we amend Rule 13d-6 as proposed?
68. Should we add new Rule 13d-6(c), as proposed, to exempt certain concerted actions by
two or more persons from serving as the basis for group formation? Are the proposed
conditions for reliance on this exemption appropriate? For example, is there another way
that we can ensure that persons seeking to rely upon the exemption would independently
reach decisions that result in concerted action being taken other than by requiring that

150 Current Rule 13d-5(b), by its terms, acknowledges that the joint, concerted action by institutional investors
specified in Rule 13d-1(b) to purchase an issuer’s equity securities pursuant to an agreement among QIIs would
constitute an acquisition by a group subject to Section 13(d) absent a regulatory accommodation. The Commission
therefore adopted the equivalent of an exemption by codifying its view within Rule 13d-5(b)(2) that the “group shall
be deemed not to have acquired any equity securities beneficially owned by the other members of the group.”
94
such persons not be directly or indirectly obligated to take concerted actions, as proposed
in Rule 13d-6(c)(2)? Alternatively, if we adopt proposed Rule 13d-6(c), should we omit
proposed paragraph (c)(2) and, therefore, only condition availability of the exemption on
the requirement set forth in proposed paragraph (c)(1)?
69. Is the proposed Rule 13d-6(c) exemption broad enough to exempt activity by shareholders
who coordinate to make non-binding proposals under 17 CFR 240.14a-8 or otherwise, or
is an express exemption needed for shareholders who act together in introducing such
proposals?
70. Should we add new Rule 13d-6(d), as proposed, to exempt the entrance by two or more
persons into an agreement governing the terms of a derivative security from serving as the
basis for group formation? Are the proposed conditions for reliance on this exemption
appropriate? For example, does the condition that the agreement must be a bona fide
purchase and sale agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business mitigate the
concerns underlying Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3)?
71. Will the proposed new exemptions in Rule 13d-6 facilitate any actions that would be
contrary to the intent of Sections 13(d) and 13(g)?
72. Congress broadly determined that when two or more persons “act as” a group for the
purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of a covered class, the persons would be treated
as a single person for purposes of reporting beneficial ownership. Are there actions taken
among shareholders other than the ones that we have proposed to exempt that the
Commission should consider exempting?
73. To the extent that a group would qualify to report on Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule 13d1(b), (c), or (d), do the costs of such a group complying with the beneficial ownership
reporting requirements outweigh the benefits? For example, how would a Schedule 13G
filed by a group contribute to price discovery? Should the Commission wholly exempt
95
any group that qualifies to file a Schedule 13G from having to report at all, and if so,
under what other conditions, if any, should such an exemption be available?
74. Should we redesignate current Rule 13d-5(b)(2) as new Rule 13d-6(b), as proposed?
Would the relocation of that exemption, without altering the substance of that exemption,
alter its availability or use or have any other collateral effects?
E. Proposed Amendments to Schedule 13D to Clarify Disclosure Requirements
Regarding Derivative Securities
We are proposing to amend Schedule 13D, codified at Rule 13d-101, to clarify the
disclosure requirements with respect to derivative securities held by a person reporting on that
schedule. Specifically, we are proposing to amend Item 6 to Schedule 13D to remove any
implication that a person is not required to disclose interests in all derivative securities that use a
covered class as a reference security.
1. Background
In enacting Sections 13(d)(1)(A) through (E),151 Congress specified certain information
that beneficial owners must report once they incur a filing obligation. Under Section
13(d)(1)(E), Congress provided that a beneficial owner must report “information as to any
contracts, arrangements, or understandings with any person with respect to any securities of the
issuer, including [the] transfer of any of the securities, joint ventures, loan or option
arrangements, puts or calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or guaranties of profits,
division of losses or profits, or the giving or with holding of proxies . . . .” Consistent with the
mandate of Section 13(d)(1)(E), this baseline disclosure requirement has existed within Schedule
13D since 1968.

151 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(1).
96
Schedule 13D sets forth the information that beneficial owners reporting pursuant to Rule
13d-1(a) or 13d-2(a) must disclose. In addition to the information specified by Sections
13(d)(1)(A) through (E), Congress also authorized the Commission to require disclosure of “such
additional information” it prescribes as “necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors.”
Item 6 of Schedule 13D requires beneficial owners to “[d]escribe any contracts,
arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in
Item 2 [of Schedule 13D] and between such persons and any person with respect to any
securities of the issuer” and sets forth a non-exclusive list of examples of such contracts,
arrangements, understandings or relationships. 152 Because cash-settled derivative securities were
not expressly included among these examples, questions may arise as to whether beneficial
owners should report contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships “with respect to”
an issuer’s securities given that (1) only a purely economic, but no legal, interest is held through
such derivatives in any class of an issuer’s securities and (2) the issuer’s securities are only used
as a reference security. 153 Further, the current requirement could be interpreted as excluding the
use of cash-settled options not offered or sold by the issuer, or other derivatives not originating
with the issuer, including other cash-settled derivatives such as security-based swaps.
2. Proposed Amendments

152 17 CFR 240.13d-101. This rule codifies Schedule 13D, and Instruction A thereto provides, in relevant part, that a
filer must “[a]nswer every item. If an item is inapplicable or the answer is in the negative, so state.” Id. To the
extent the initial disclosure provided indicates that the item was inapplicable or that there were no contracts,
arrangements, understandings or relationships to report, the filer remains obligated under Section 13(d)(2) and
corresponding Rule 13d-2(a) to report material changes to such a response.
153 As used in this release and the proposed revision to Item 6 of Schedule 13D, the term “reference security” means
the class of securities into which a derivative security is convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, or,
alternatively, if not convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, the class of securities from which the
derivative security has economic exposure and has its value determined according to the terms of the derivative’s
governing instrument.
97
We are proposing to amend to Item 6 of Schedule 13D to clarify that a person is required
to disclose interests in all derivative securities that use the issuer’s equity security as a reference
security. The proposed amendment would expressly state that such derivative contracts,
arrangements, understandings and relationships with respect to an issuer’s securities, including
cash-settled security-based swaps and other derivatives which are settled exclusively in cash,
would need to be disclosed under Item 6 of Schedule 13D in order to comply with Rules 13d1(a) and 13d-101.
The proposed amendment also would clarify that the derivative security need not have
originated with the issuer or otherwise be part of its capital structure in order for a disclosure
obligation to arise. At present, the formulation “with respect to securities of the issuer” in Item 6
might be read to suggest that contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships that only
create economic exposure to the issuer’s equity securities or are otherwise considered synthetic
could be excluded. Accordingly, to remove any ambiguity as to the scope of the required
disclosures, we propose to revise Item 6 to expressly state that the use of derivative instruments,
including cash-settled security-based swaps and other derivatives settled exclusively in cash,
which use the issuer’s securities as a reference security are included among the types of
contracts, arrangements, understandings and relationships which must be disclosed. To further
minimize any potential ambiguity regarding what interests need to be disclosed, we also propose
to eliminate the “including but not limited to” regulatory text that precedes the itemization of the
instruments or arrangements covered.
Request for Comment
75. Should we amend Item 6 of Schedule 13D as proposed?
76. Are there any reasons not to expressly require disclosure of contracts, arrangements,
understandings or relationships involving cash-settled derivative securities, including
security-based swaps, under Item 6? To the extent that any such derivative instruments
98
should not be subject to disclosure, why would excluding such instruments be appropriate
given the statutory mandate in Section 13(d)(1)(E)?
77. Do any other modifications need to be made to Item 6 in order to clarify the types of
instruments or arrangements that are required to be disclosed, and, if so, what
clarifications should we make and why? For example, should we include a general
“catch-all” provision that requires disclosure of any contracts, arrangements,
understandings or relationships substantially similar to the ones listed?
78. Should the “including but not limited to language” under Item 6 be eliminated, as
proposed? Would this serve to remove ambiguity about what is required by the Item?
Should the language be retained, and if so, why? Do any interests in a class of an issuer’s
securities exist that derive from sources not considered to be contracts, arrangements,
understandings or relationships that should be subject to disclosure under Item 6, and if so,
what are those sources? Conversely, are there reasons to exclude any particular
instrument or class of instrument from Item 6 of Schedule 13D?
F. Proposed Structured Data Requirement for Schedules 13D and 13G
We are proposing to require that beneficial ownership reports on Schedules 13D and 13G
be filed using a structured, machine-readable data language. In particular, we are proposing to
require that Schedules 13D and 13G be filed in part using an XML-based language specific to
Schedules 13D and 13G (“13D/G-specific XML”).154 For both Schedules, all disclosures,
including quantitative disclosures, textual narratives, and identification checkboxes, would be

154 This would be consistent with the approach used for other XML-based structured data languages created by the
Commission for certain EDGAR Forms, including the data languages used for reports on each of Form 13F, Form D
and the Section 16 beneficial ownership reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5).
99
structured in 13D/G-specific XML under the proposal, with the exception of the exhibits to the
Schedules, which would remain unstructured.
1. Background
Currently, the EDGAR Filer Manual requires Schedules 13D and 13G to be filed
electronically on the Commission’s EDGAR system in HTML or ASCII.155 HTML and ASCII
are both unstructured data languages; thus, the disclosures reported on Schedules 13D and 13G
are not currently machine-readable. 156 As a result, information disclosed on Schedules 13D and
13G is more difficult for investors and markets to access, compile and analyze as compared to
information that is submitted in a machine-readable data language.
While the majority of EDGAR filings are submitted in HTML or ASCII, certain EDGAR
filings are submitted using machine-readable, XML-based languages that are each specific to the
particular EDGAR document type being submitted.157 This includes filings that, like Schedules
13D and 13G, are submitted by individuals and entities other than the registrant.158 For these
EDGAR XML filings, filers are typically provided the option to either submit the filing directly
to EDGAR in XML, or manually input their disclosures in an online web application and/or web

155 See supra Section II.A.6.a; EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 59 (Sept. 2021) (“EDGAR Filer Manual”),
at 5-1 (requiring EDGAR filers generally to use ASCII or HTML for their document submissions, subject to certain
exceptions). Schedule 13D and 13G filers are required, by rule, to comply with the requirements of the EDGAR
Filer Manual. See 17 CFR 232.301 (“Filers must prepare electronic filings in the manner prescribed by the EDGAR
Filer Manual, promulgated by the Commission, which sets forth the technical formatting requirements for electronic
submissions.”).
156 The term “machine-readable” is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502 as “data in a format that can be easily processed by a
computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.”
157 See Current and Draft Technical Specifications, available at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filer-information/currentedgar-technical-specifications.
158 Examples include the Section 16 beneficial ownership reports (Form 3, 4 and 5) and Form 13F. See id.
100
form developed by the Commission that converts the completed form into an EDGAR-specific
XML document.
2. Proposed Amendments
We are proposing to replace the current HTML or ASCII requirement for Schedules 13D
and 13G in the EDGAR Filer Manual with a structured data language requirement—specifically,
with a requirement to use Schedule 13D/G-specific XML—for the disclosures reported on those
Schedules. As is the case with other EDGAR Form-specific XML filings, reporting persons
would be able to, at their option, submit filings directly to EDGAR in Schedule 13D/G-specific
XML or use a web-based reporting application developed by the Commission that would
generate the Schedule in 13D/G-specific XML. 159 We believe that a structured data requirement
for the disclosures reported on Schedules 13D and 13G would greatly improve the accessibility
and usability of the disclosures, allowing investors to access, aggregate and analyze the reported
information in a much more timely and efficient manner.160
Request for Comment
79. Should we replace the current HTML or ASCII requirement for Schedules 13D and 13G
with a structured data requirement for the disclosures reported on those Schedules, as
proposed?

159 In addition, the Commission would develop electronic “style sheets” that, when applied to the reported XML
data, would represent that data in human-readable form on EDGAR.
160 Section 13(g)(5) of the Exchange Act provides, in part, that “the Commission shall take such steps as it deems
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors . . . to tabulate and promptly make
available the information contained in any report filed pursuant to this subsection in a manner which will, in the
view of the Commission, maximize the usefulness of the information to . . . the public.” 15 U.S.C. 78m(g)(5). The
requirements proposed in this section would be consistent with this mandate. Although this statutory language
applies only to beneficial ownership reports filed pursuant to Section 13(g)—i.e., a Schedule 13G filed by an
Exempt Investor—we believe these public benefits would be furthered by applying the requirements proposed in
this section to all Schedule 13D and 13G filers.
101
80. Rather than adding a structured data requirement for all disclosures (other than exhibits)
reported on Schedules 13D and 13G, should we narrow the requirement to cover only a
subset of the disclosures, such as the quantitative disclosures?
81. Should we require the disclosures on Schedules 13D and 13G to be submitted using a
different structured data language than 13D/G-specific XML? Why or why not? If
another structured data language would be more appropriate, please identify which one,
and explain why.
82. Would this proposed requirement yield reported data that is more useful to investors,
compared with maintaining the current HTML or ASCII requirement for Schedules 13D
and 13G, or requiring Schedules 13D and 13G to be filed in a structured data language
other than a 13D/G-specific XML?
G. Implications of the Proposed Amendments on Section 16
Section 16 of the Exchange Act was designed both to provide the public with information
about securities transactions and holdings of every person who is the beneficial owner of more
than 10% of a class of equity security registered under Exchange Act Section 12161 (“10%
holder”), and each officer and director (collectively, “insiders”) of the issuer of such a security,
and to deter such insiders from profiting from short-term trading in issuer securities while in
possession of material, non-public information. Upon becoming an insider, or upon Section 12
registration of the class of equity security, Section 16(a)162 requires an insider to file an initial
report with the Commission disclosing his or her beneficial ownership of all equity securities of

161 15 U.S.C. 78l.
162 15 U.S.C. 78p(a).
102
the issuer.163 Section 16(a) also requires insiders to report subsequent changes in such
ownership. 164 To prevent misuse of inside information by insiders, Section 16(b)165 provides the
issuer (or shareholders suing on the issuer’s behalf) a private right of action to recover any profit
realized by an insider from any purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) of any equity security of
the issuer within a period of less than six months. 166
As applied to 10% holders, Congress intended Section 16 to reach persons presumed to
have access to information because they can influence or control the issuer as a result of their
equity ownership.167 Because Section 13(d) addresses these types of relationships, the
Commission adopted Rule 16a-1(a)(1) to define 10% holders under Section 16 as persons
deemed 10% beneficial owners under Section 13(d) and the rules thereunder.168 The Section
13(d) analysis, such as counting beneficial ownership of the equity securities underlying
derivative securities exercisable or convertible within 60 days, 169 is therefore imported into the
10% holder determination for Section 16 purposes. The application of Rule 16a-1(a)(1) is

163 Insiders file these reports on Form 3. 17 CFR 249.103.
164 Insiders file transaction reports on Forms 4 and 5. 17 CFR 249.104 and 249.105.
165 15 U.S.C. 78p(b).
166 In addition, insiders are subject to the short sale prohibitions of Section 16(c).
167 See S. Rep. No. 1455, at 55, 68 (1934); see also S. Rep. No. 792, at 20-1 (1934); S. Rep. No. 379, at 21-2 (1963).
168 Ownership Reports and Trading By Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders, Release No. 34-28869
(Feb. 21, 1991) [56 FR 7242 (Feb. 21, 1991)] (stating that as applied to 10% holders, Section 16 “is intended to
reach those persons who can be presumed to have access to inside information because they can influence or control
the issuer as a result of their equity ownership” and noting that Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act “specifically
addresses such relationships”).

103
straightforward; if a person is a 10% beneficial owner as determined pursuant to Section 13(d)
and the rules thereunder, the person is deemed a 10% holder under Section 16.170
Thus, the proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3, 13d-5 and 13d-6 would directly impact
the analysis under Rule 16a-1(a)(1) as to whether a person is a 10% holder. For example,
because proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would provide that holders of cash-settled derivative securities
in specified circumstances will be “deemed” beneficial owners of the reference securities in a
covered class for purposes of Sections 13(d) and (g), those holders also would be deemed
beneficial owners of such reference securities for purposes of determining whether that person is
a 10% holder under Section 16. By expanding the meaning of “beneficial owner” under Rule
16a-1(a)(1) to include persons who hold cash-settled derivatives in specified circumstances,
proposed Rule 13d-3(e) could increase the number of 10% holders and, in turn, the number of
persons subject to Section 16(a)’s disclosure obligations, 171 Section 16(b)’s short-swing profit
liability172 and Section 16(c)’s short sale prohibitions.173 Similarly, two or more persons may be
deemed to have formed a group that beneficially owns more than 10% of a covered class as a
result of the application of our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5, particularly with respect to
the tipper-tippee relationships that are the subject of proposed Rule 13d-5(b)(1)(ii). Under this
circumstance, each group member would be considered a 10% holder subject to Sections 16(a),

170 For example, the Commission applied an analysis derived from Rule 13d-3(d)(1) in publishing its views
regarding when equity securities underlying a security future that requires physical settlement should be counted for
purposes of determining whether the purchaser of the security future is subject to Section 16 as a 10% holder by
operation of Rule 16a-1(a)(1). Commission Guidance on the Application of Certain Provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules thereunder to Trading in Security Futures Products,
Release No. 34-46101 (June 21, 2002) [67 FR 43234 at Q 7 (June 27, 2002)].

172 See supra note 165 and accompanying text.
173 See supra note 166.
104
(b), and (c).174 By contrast, the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-6 would create new
exemptions under which two or more persons will not be deemed to have acquired beneficial
ownership of an issuer’s equity securities as a group. To the extent beneficial owners qualify for
and rely on the proposed exemptions in Rule 13d-6, those exemptions may offset any potential
increase in the number of persons who become 10% holders as a result of our proposed
amendments to Rule 13d-5.
Given that Rule 16a-1(a)(1) has the same purpose as Regulation 13D-G—i.e., to identify
persons who can influence or control the issuer as the result of equity ownership—it appears
appropriate to continue to apply the standards of Regulation 13D-G, as proposed to be amended,
to identify 10% holders subject to Section 16. Accordingly, we believe it is not necessary to
propose any amendments to Rule 16a-1(a)(1) in this release, but solicit public comment on the
Section 16 implications resulting from our proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3, 13d-5, and
13d-6.
Request for Comment
83. Should Rule 16a-1(a)(1) import the beneficial ownership determinations of proposed Rule
13d-3(e) to determine who is a 10% holder for purposes of Section 16?
84. Conversely, should we exclude holdings of cash-settled derivative securities with the
purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the issuer that would be included
for the purposes of proposed Rule 13d-3(e) from 10% holder identification for purposes of
Section 16? If so, should all types of such derivative holdings be excluded or only certain
types of instruments? For example, under proposed Rule 13d-3(e), only long positions in

174 Ownership Reports and Trading By Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders, Release No. 34-28869
(Feb. 21, 1991) [56 FR 7242 at n.54 (Feb. 21, 1991)] (noting that “[i]n contrast to Section 13(d), which requires a
group filing, the group itself would not be a separate person for Section 16 purposes” and that, instead, “for purposes
of determining status as a ten percent holder under Section 16, the securities beneficially owned by the group must
be included in the calculation by each individual member of the group”).
105
such securities would be counted, and short positions would not be netted against long
positions or otherwise taken into account. Similarly, as proposed, if a derivative security
does not have a fixed delta (i.e., if the delta is variable and changes over the term of the
derivative security), then a person who holds such derivative security would calculate the
delta on a daily basis based on the closing market price of the reference equity security on
that day for purposes of determining whether such person is a 10% holder. Are these
criteria appropriate to apply to 10% holder determinations under Section 16?
85. Would including ownership of cash-settled derivative securities held with the purpose or
effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer for purposes of 10% holder
determinations be consistent with the purposes of Section 16? Should inclusion of these
securities result in persons becoming 10% holders subject to Section 16(b)’s short-swing
profit liability and Section 16(c)’s short sale prohibitions, as well as Section 16(a)’s
disclosure obligations? If not, please explain why.
86. Would the inclusion of such securities for purposes of Section 16 10% holder
determinations cause practical issues for any type of business? For example, would this
potentially impair the capability of financial institutions to execute transactions using
derivative securities, including as counterparties to clients, in the ordinary course of their
business? If so, please explain why.
87. Are there reasons why a holder of the cash-settled derivative securities covered by
proposed Rule 13d-3(e) should be deemed the beneficial owner of the reference securities
in a covered class for purposes of Sections 13(d) and (g) but not the beneficial owner of
those reference securities for purposes of determining whether that person is a 10% holder
under Section 16? If so, should we amend Rule 16a-1(a)(1) to avoid the application of
proposed Rule 13d-3(e) to the determination as to whether a person is a 10% holder under
Section 16? For example, should we amend Rule 16a-1(a)(1) such that it defines 10%
106
holders under Section 16 as persons deemed 10% beneficial owners under Section 13(d)
and the rules thereunder other than Rule 13d-3(e)?
88. Could the requirement in proposed Note 2 to Rule 13d-3(e)(2) (i.e., that the holder of a
derivative security without a fixed delta calculate the delta on a daily basis) result in
situations in which a person’s beneficial ownership does not exceed 10% of a covered
class at the time that person acquires a derivative security, but then exceeds 10% at a later
time solely by virtue of the fact that the delta of the derivative security changed (i.e., not
as a result of any further acquisitions)? If so, would it be appropriate to subject that
person to the requirements of Section 16 under such circumstances?
89. Should Rule 16a-1(a)(1) import the group formation and beneficial ownership acquisition
standards of Rule 13d-5, as altered by our proposed amendments, for purposes of
determining who is a 10% holder for purposes of Section 16?
90. Should Rule 16a-1(a)(1) import the acquisition exemptions set forth in Rule 13d-6, as
altered by our proposed amendments, for purposes of determining who is a 10% holder for
purposes of Section 16?
91. Would importing the proposed amendments to Rules 13d-5 and 13d-6, as would be the
case under Rule 16a-1(a)(1), be inconsistent with the purposes of Section 16? If so, please
explain.
III. Economic Analysis
A. Introduction
107
Section 13(d) was enacted in 1968 with the intent to alert the marketplace to rapid
accumulations of equity securities which might represent a shift in corporate control. 175 Together
with Regulation 13D-G,176 these regulatory provisions have existed for more than 50 years. As
discussed above, technological advances since 1968, such as the ability to submit filings
electronically through the Commission’s EDGAR system and the use of modern information
technology in today’s financial markets, have reduced the time needed to prepare and file
Schedules 13D and 13G.
177 Financial product innovation over the past half-century, such as the
use of cash-settled derivative securities and the advent of electronic trading, have outpaced the
reach of the regulation when first adopted.178 These developments can provide large investors
with opportunities to acquire substantial stakes in companies that exceed the Section 13(d) and
(g) reporting threshold that may not have existed previously. 179 In addition, the legal landscape
has evolved since the passage of the Williams Act. Hostile tender offers, once a prominent
hallmark of the takeover wave in the 1980s, have become comparatively rare since the
development and widespread adoption of the “poison pill” shareholder rights plan in the 1980s as
an anti-takeover device. 180 Today’s market for corporate control features activist investors,

175 See H.R. Rep. No. 90-1711 (1968), supra note 24; see also supra note 95.
176 The Commission adopted Regulation 13D, the predecessor to Regulation 13D-G, in 1968. See 33 FR 11015
(Aug. 2, 1968), supra note 64.
177 See supra Section II.A.1.
178 See supra Section II.B.
179 We note that while the reporting obligations under Exchange Act Section 16 and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 could reduce incentives for large shareholders to accumulate substantial stakes that
exceed the Section 13(d) and (g) reporting threshold, they do not eliminate those incentives or the need for more
timely beneficial ownership reporting, as proposed. See infra Section III.B.1.
180 See Kahan and Rock (2019), infra note 260 at 922-23 (“In effect, the poison pill moved the decision on the
success of a hostile bid from shareholders voting with their feet (by tendering their shares in a tender offer) to
shareholders voting by ballot (by replacing a majority of the board). . . . To get a rough sense of the current
108
particularly activist hedge funds, who seek to influence governance through accumulation of
strict minority equity stakes instead of full control. 181 As a result, less share accumulation is
needed for large investors to exert influence. To modernize the beneficial ownership reporting
requirements and improve their operation and efficacy, and to provide investors and market
participants with more timely disclosure of information related to corporate control, we are
proposing amendments to Regulation 13D-G and related technical changes to Regulation S-T.
Specifically, we are proposing to (1) revise the current deadlines for Schedule 13D and Schedule
13G filings; (2) amend Rule 13d-3 to deem holders of certain cash-settled derivative securities as
beneficial owners of the reference covered class; (3) align the text of Rule 13d-5, as applicable to
two or more persons who act as a group, with the statutory language in Sections 13(d)(3) and
(g)(3) of the Exchange Act; and (4) set forth the circumstances under which two or more persons
may communicate and consult with one another and engage with an issuer without concern that
they will be subject to regulation as a group with respect to the issuer’s equity securities. We
also are proposing certain related technical changes to Regulation S-T in connection with these
proposed amendments and requirements that Schedules 13D and 13G be filed using a structured,
machine-readable data language.

prevalence of toeholds, we collected data from Thompson Reuters on proposed takeovers that were classified as
hostile. There were twenty-four such proposals between 2010 and 2015.”); see also supra note 22.
181 See Brav, Jiang and Li (2021), infra note 215 (noting that “[a]ctivist hedge funds also differ from corporate
raiders that operated in the 1980s, as they tend to accumulate strict minority equity stakes and do not seek direct
control,” and “[a]ctivists are both outsiders and insiders, in that they do not seek full control but operate by
influencing control”). We also note that today’s market for corporate control has seen an increasing use of lowthreshold poison pills (threshold of 10%-15%) along with evolving governance practice. Legal scholars have
warned that too restrictive pills could negatively affect activist investors’ profits and incentives and thereby
activism. See Kahan and Rock (2019), infra note 260 (recommending that “[w]hether pills with a threshold of 10%
or 15% (low-threshold pills) should be permitted against activists [should] depend[] on the context,” and “pills with
a threshold of less than 10% and pills with a ‘wolf-pack’ trigger [should be regarded as] presumptively invalid”
because “[s]uch pills are not a reasonable response to any cognizable threat and impose excessive restrictions on the
ability of an activist to conduct a credible contest and communicate with other shareholders”); see also infra Section
III.C.1.b.i.
109
Overall, we believe the proposed amendments would benefit investors and market
participants by providing more timely information relating to significant stockholders as well as
potential changes in corporate control, facilitating investor decision-making and reducing
information asymmetry in the market. We also recognize that these amendments could increase
costs for investors and issuers. For example, the amendments could increase costs for
blockholders seeking to influence or control an issuer, and therefore potentially inhibit
shareholder activism and the improvement of corporate efficiency.
We are mindful of the costs and benefits of the proposed amendments. The discussion
below discusses in detail the potential economic effects of the proposed amendments, including
the likely benefits and costs, as well as the likely effects on efficiency, competition and capital
formation. 182 At the outset, we note that, where possible, we have attempted to quantify the
benefits, costs and effects on efficiency, competition and capital formation expected to result
from the proposed amendments. However, we are unable to quantify all potential economic
effects because we lack information necessary to provide reasonable estimates for those effects.
For example, the Commission is unable to reasonably quantify the potential harm to investors as
a result of mispricing under the current rules, or the reduction in trading costs due to
improvements to liquidity or capital formation that may arise from more efficient pricing under
the proposed amendments. We also are unable to quantify, with precision, the increased costs
for blockholders to initiate corporate change as a result of the shortened Schedule 13D filing

182 Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(f)] requires the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking
where it is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and
capital formation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)] requires the Commission,
when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that the rules would have on competition and
prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act.

deadlines and, therefore, the reduction of the costs and benefits the presence of such
blockholders bring. To estimate such costs, we would need to know, for example, how many
potential blockholders would reduce their share accumulation prior to disclosure after the
proposed rule change, and the amount of any such reduction. The ability for blockholders to
achieve their target accumulation level prior to disclosure depends on such target level, the
liquidity of the targeted covered class, their acquisition plans and their ability to adapt the plans.
Because we do not have all the inputs for these variables, we cannot provide a reasonable
estimate of the effects of the proposed amendments. Where we are unable to quantify the
economic effects of the proposed amendments, we provide a qualitative assessment of the
potential effects and encourage commenters to provide data and information that would help
quantify the benefits, costs and potential impacts of the proposed amendments on efficiency,
competition and capital formation.
B. Economic Baseline
1. Current Regulatory Framework
To understand the effects of the proposed amendments, we first compare them to the
current regulatory framework.
a. Filing Deadlines
Section 13(d)(1) and Rule 13d-1(a) together require a person who directly or indirectly
acquires “beneficial ownership” of more than 5% of a covered class to file a Schedule 13D
within 10 days of the acquisition that exceeds 5%.183 For investors who are eligible to file a
Schedule 13G, the filing deadlines for the initial Schedule 13G are 45 days after the end of
calendar year for QIIs and Exempt Investors if they beneficially own more than 5% of a covered
class as of the last day of the calendar year, and within 10 days of acquiring beneficial ownership

183 See supra Section II.A.1.
111
of more than 5% of a covered class for Passive Investors, under Rules 13d-1(b), (d), and (c),
respectively. 184 Rules 13d-1(e), (f), and (g) set forth the initial Schedule 13D filing obligations
for investors who are no longer eligible to file Schedule 13G.185
Sections 13(d)(2) and 13(g)(2), together with Rules 13d-2(a), (b), (c), and (d), set forth
amendment obligations related to original filings. Rule 13d-2(a) provides that if any material
change occurs to the facts reported in the initial Schedule 13D filing, an amendment disclosing
that change shall be filed with the Commission “promptly.”186 Rule 13d-2(b) requires that for all
persons who report beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, an amendment shall be filed “within
forty-five days after the end of each calendar year if, as of the end of the calendar year, there are
any changes in the information reported in the previous filing on that Schedule [13G].”187 In
addition, Rule 13d-2(c) requires QIIs to file an amendment to their Schedule 13G within 10 days
after the end of the first month in which their beneficial ownership exceeds 10% of a covered
class, or increases or decreases by more than 5% of the covered class, once across the 10%
threshold. 188 For Passive Investors, current Rule 13d-2(d) requires that they “promptly” file an
amendment to their Schedule 13G upon acquiring greater than 10% of a covered class, or if, once
across the 10% threshold, they increase or decrease their beneficial ownership by more than 5%
of the covered class.189

In addition to Sections 13(d) and (g), Exchange Act Section 16 provides the public with
information about the securities transactions and holdings of an insider of an issuer, including
10% holders. 190 Rule 16a-1(a)(1) defines 10% holders under Section 16 as persons deemed 10%
beneficial owners under Section 13(d) and the rules thereunder.191 Within 10 days of becoming
an insider (including within 10 days of becoming a 10% holder), or upon registration of the class
of equity security under Section 12, Section 16(a) requires an insider to file an initial report
(Form 3) with the Commission disclosing his or her beneficial ownership of all equity securities
of the issuer.192 Section 16(a) also requires insiders (including 10% holders) to report subsequent
changes in such ownership by the end of the second business day following the day the
transaction was executed (Form 4).
193 These filing requirements are not necessarily duplicative
with the Schedule 13D and 13G filing requirements given that, among other things, they only
begin to apply to certain beneficial owners once the 10% threshold has been crossed and may
require materially different disclosures, such as those relating to pecuniary interests. The
reporting obligation under Section 16 could reduce incentives for large shareholders to
accumulate stakes exceeding 10%; however, it should not eliminate such incentives, the extent of
which would depend on the objectives of the blockholders.
Lastly, certain acquisitions of ownership stakes are reportable under the Hart-ScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”)194 via the Notification and Report Form.195

190 See supra Section II.G.

192 See 15 U.S.C. 78p(a)(2)(B); see also supra notes 162-163 and accompanying text.
193 See 15 U.S.C. 78p(a)(2)(C); see also supra note 164 and accompanying text.

113
Instead of requiring public disclosure after acquiring beneficial ownership of a certain percentage
of the covered class, HSR requires notification to the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice prior to acquisition of any voting securities or assets if the acquisition will
cause value of the acquirer’s holdings to exceed certain dollar thresholds (i.e., if the value of
equity or assets to be acquired exceeds $368 million, or if it is between $92 million and $368
million and meets some additional criteria).196 Because the dollar thresholds are not tied to the
size of the target company, the category of persons required to report under Sections 13(d) and
(g) would not necessarily be identical to those required to give prior notice under HSR. Also,
unlike Section 13(d) and (g) reporting, the filing of the Notification and Report Form and the
information in it are not publicly disclosed, except in some special circumstances.
197 Similar to
Section 16 reporting obligations, reporting obligations under HSR could also reduce incentives
for blockholders to accumulate ownership. However, this effect should be relatively smaller
than those under Section 16, because the filings under HSR are not publicly disclosed.
b. Beneficial Ownership
Neither Section 3(a) nor Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act defines the term “beneficial
owner” or “beneficial ownership.” Regulation 13D-G similarly does not expressly define those
terms. Rule 13d-3(a) provides that a person is a beneficial owner of a security if that person,
directly or indirectly, has or shares voting power and/or investment power. In addition, Rule
13d-3 deems certain persons to be beneficial owners even if they lack voting power and
investment power. Rule 13d-3(b) deems a person who uses any contract, arrangement or device

196 See 15 U.S.C. 18a(a), (b)(1)(A); 16 CFR 803.1; Revised Jurisdictional Thresholds for Section 7A of the Clayton
Act, 86 FR 7870 (Feb. 2, 2021). Specifically, notification is required either by planned acquisition of in excess of
$200 million in voting securities or assets as adjusted annually or in excess of $50 million as adjusted annually
combined with certain additional factors. Adjusted thresholds are published for each fiscal year to reflect the
percentage change in the gross national product for that year compared to the gross national product for the year
ending September 30, 2003.
197 See 15 U.S.C. 18a(h).
114
to divest or prevent the vesting of beneficial ownership of the security as part of a plan or scheme
to evade reporting under Section 13(d) to be a beneficial owner. Rule 13d-3(d) deems a person
to be a beneficial owner of an equity security if that person holds a right to acquire the security
that is exercisable within 60 days or who acquires a right to acquire the security for the purpose
or with the effect of changing or influencing control of the issuer of securities regardless of when
that right is exercisable. Under the current rule, the scope of beneficial ownership ordinarily
does not include holders of cash-settled derivative securities because those instruments generally
do not convey voting or investment power over any equity securities in the reference covered
class. 198 As noted above, if a person is deemed a beneficial owner for the purposes of Section
13(d) and the rules thereunder, then he or she also is deemed a beneficial owner for the purposes
of Exchange Act Section 16 to the extent the beneficial ownership held exceeds 10% of a
covered class. 199
c. Group Formation
Under Sections 13(d)(3) and (g)(3), two or more persons “act[ing]” as a “group for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of [equity] securities” constitute a single person for
purposes of those statutory provisions. 200 Rule 13d-5(b) states that when two or more persons
“agree to act together” for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing equity
securities, the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, for

198 See supra Section II.B.1. Under certain circumstances, investors in security-based swaps may be beneficial
owners, as determined under Rule 13d-3, of a covered class. To the extent that a holder of a security-based swap
owns that security not exclusively settled in cash, the person could be viewed as a beneficial owner under Rule 13d3(d)(1). In addition, if a security-based swap is used as part of plan or scheme to evade beneficial ownership
reporting, the person could be deemed a beneficial owner as described in Rule 13d-3(b). Finally, if the holder of a
security-based swap directly or indirectly holds the power to direct a counterparty how to vote or dispose of shares
in a covered class used as a reference security, that person can be a beneficial owner as provided in Rule 13d-3(a).

64628 (June 8, 2011) [76 FR 34579 (June 14, 2011)].

115
purposes of Sections 13(d) and (g), of all equity securities of the issuer beneficially owned by
such persons.
d. Item 6 of Schedule 13D
As discussed in Section II.E.1., Congress set forth a statutory requirement under Section
13(d)(1)(E) that a person disclose “information as to any contracts, arrangements, or
understandings with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including [the]
transfer of any of the securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls,
guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or guaranties of profits, division of losses or profits,
or the giving or with holding of proxies . . . .” This obligation is codified at Rule 13d-101 and
reflected in Item 6 of Schedule 13D. Item 6 provides only an illustrative subset of the types of
contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships that must be disclosed, and cash-settled
derivative securities have not been expressly identified in the list of examples, which could
create an impression that a person is not required to disclose interests in all derivative securities
that use the issuer’s equity security as a reference security.
2. Affected Parties
The relevant market participants for purposes of establishing the economic baseline for
the proposed rules include: all investors that are required or potentially required to report their
beneficial ownership on Schedules 13D and 13G; the issuers of the equity securities beneficially
owned; investors that rely on beneficial ownership reports in connection with their investment
decisions as to issuers’ securities; shareholders of the issuer, particularly the long-term
shareholders of the issuer, who might be more affected by shareholder activism; market
professionals, such as analysts that valuate securities; the financial institutions that serve as
counterparties to cash-settled derivatives; and the management of the issuer. Section 16 filers
also are relevant market participants because Section 13(d) and the rules thereunder are used to
116
determine whether a person’s beneficial ownership exceeds 10% and must be reported on Forms
3, 4 and 5.
During the calendar year 2020, the Commission received a total of 10,542 Schedule 13D
filings201 and 44,059 Schedule 13G filings, 202 involving 3,940 unique Schedule 13D filers and
8,789 unique Schedule 13G filers, respectively. To understand the extent to which the proposed
amendments could affect holders with reporting obligations, we examine their current filing
practice. Our preliminary analysis of the 2020 filings 203 shows that Schedule 13D filers reported
a median accumulation of 8.4% of shares in their initial Schedule 13D filings. Approximately
20.7% of the initial Schedule 13D filings were filed within the first five days after the acquisition
that crossed the 5% threshold. The median number of days between the acquisition that crossed
the 5% threshold and the initial Schedule 13D filing was 10 days204 with 22.9% of the initial
Schedule 13D filings being made on the 10th day. A detailed day-by-day breakdown of the
percentage of the filings made each day after crossing the 5% threshold is provided in Figure 1
and Table 1 below. For Schedule 13G filers, the median number of days between the date on
which the 5% threshold was crossed and the initial filing was 21, and the median reported
accumulation was 6.3%.205

201 Out of all the Schedule 13D filings, there were a total of 2,288 initial filings and 8,254 amendments.
202 Out of all the Schedule 13G filings, there were a total of 12,838 initial filings and 31,221 amendments.
203 We were able to collect data for our analysis from 2,236 initial Schedule 13D filings and 12,759 initial Schedule
13G filings. Out of the 2,236 initial Schedule 13D filings, there are 994 unique filings with sufficient data for our
subsequent analysis.
204 We note that approximately 32.9% of the Schedule 13D filings were made after 10 days. However, not all of
these filings are considered late by the Commission. By rule, the Commission accepts as timely any filing that, if
the calendar due date falls on a weekend or holiday, is received by the next business day. See supra note 3.
Therefore, after we take into account weekends and holidays, we preliminarily estimate that about 20.1% of the
filings are deemed late.
205 We note that Schedule 13G filers include QIIs, Exempt Investors and Passive Investors. Under the current rules,
Passive Investors must file their initial Schedule 13G within 10 days of acquiring more than 5% beneficial
117

ownership, and Exempt Investors and QIIs must file within 45 days of the calendar year end in which their
beneficial ownership exceeds 5%. Accordingly, the median filing time for all Schedule 13G filers presented here
could be skewed for different types of filers. More specifically, the median of 21 days might be shorter than the
actual median for QIIs and Exempt Investors, and longer than the actual median for Passive Investors. It is
impracticable to produce statistics for different types of filers at this point because underlying data are not structured
into an analyzable format.

initial Schedule 13D
Note: The graph and table are based on staff analysis of 2020 EDGAR initial Schedule 13D filings. Filers are
currently required to file within 10 days of the acquisition that exceeds 5% of a covered class.
C. Potential Benefits and Costs of the Proposed Amendments
We have considered the potential costs and benefits associated with the proposed
amendments. Overall, we believe the proposed amendments to Regulation 13D-G would benefit
investors and market participants by providing more timely information relating to significant
stockholders as well as potential changes in corporate control, facilitating investor decisionmaking, reducing information asymmetry and improving price discovery in the market. We also
recognize that the proposed amendments could impose costs on the affected parties. For

instance, the proposed amendments could increase the costs for blockholders to influence or
control an issuer and potentially inhibit shareholder activism and its goal of improving corporate
efficiency. A discussion of the anticipated economic costs and benefits of the proposed
amendments is set forth in more detail below. We also expect the proposed amendments to
affect compliance burdens. The quantitative estimates of changes in those burdens for purposes
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”) are further discussed in Section IV below. For
purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the proposed amendments would result in an increase of
140,799 burden hours from the increase in the number Schedule 13D filings and 13G filings. 206
In addition, the estimated increase in the paperwork burden as a result of the proposed
amendments for Forms 3, 4, and 5 will be 1,099 hours, 16,911 hours and 594 hours,
respectively. 207
1. Proposed Amendments to Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 and Rules 13 and 201 of
Regulation S-T
a. Benefits
i. Schedule 13D filing deadlines
We are proposing to amend Rule 13d-1(a) to shorten the initial Schedule 13D reporting
deadline from 10 days to five days after the date of the acquisition that exceeds 5% of a covered
class. We believe the proposed change would benefit investors, issuers and other market
participants by providing them more timely disclosure on material information related to
potential changes of corporate control. More timely disclosure of such market-moving
information could improve transparency, reduce information asymmetry and mispricing in the
market, and allow investors to make more informed investment decisions.

206 See infra Section IV.B.
207 See infra Section IV.B.
120
As discussed above, significant stock ownership contains market-moving information
related to potential changes of corporate control which could influence investors’ decision
making, and therefore Section 13(d) was enacted with the intention to “alert the market place to
every large, rapid aggregation or accumulation of securities, regardless of technique employed,
which might represent a potential shift in corporate control.”208 Following technological
advances and financial product innovation in the years since Section 13(d)’s enactment,209 the
current 10-day filing deadline under Section 13(d)(1) and Rule 13d-1(a) could be used by
shareholders to acquire more—sometimes far more—than 5% of a covered class during the 10-
day window before any disclosure, a concern raised by some observers.210 For example, Barry,
Brav and Jiang (2020) has documented that, while blockholders disclosed a median ownership of
6.5% in their Schedule 13D filings, filers in the top 5th percentile of reported ownership disclosed
an accumulation of 22.5% of the shares when initial Schedule 13D filings are made, 211 far
exceeding the 5% threshold. These statistics suggest that while the reporting obligations under
Section 16 and HSR may reduce the incentives for shareholders to accumulate ownership far
above the statutory threshold, they do not eliminate such accumulations. However, such practice
is also not as pervasive as some have claimed.212 Nevertheless, the ability or practice for

121
shareholders to accumulate a level of beneficial ownership far exceeding the statutory threshold
without timely disclosure could undermine the benefits of beneficial ownership reporting,
increasing information asymmetry and mispricing in the market. Thus, by shortening the
deadline for initial Schedule 13D filings, the proposed amendment could improve the timeliness
of beneficial ownership reporting, benefiting investors and other market participants through
improved transparency and reduced information asymmetry in the market.
Schedule 13D contains information related to significant stockholders and potential
changes of corporate control. Such information is important to investors’ decision making,
because the change in control over the issuer of the relevant covered class could directly affect
the change in management, its key operational decisions, strategy and financial results, and
thereby its valuation. 213 The current 10-day filing deadline leads to a delay of such market
moving information being incorporated by the market, leading to less efficient pricing and
information asymmetries that would harm investors.214 It is well documented in the academic
literature that economically significant price changes occur in response to news about changes in
corporate control, such as the initial filing of a Schedule 13D.215 For example, Brav et al. (2008)

213 See, e.g., Brav et al. (2008), infra note 215 (finding an increase in issuer’s payout, operating performance and
CEO turnover after 13D filings).
214 See, e.g., Wachtell Petition, supra note 16 (“[T]he ten-day [Schedule 13D] reporting lag leaves a substantial gap
after the reporting threshold has been crossed during which the market is deprived of material information and
creates incentives for abusive tactics on the part of aggressive investor prior to making a filing.”); see also, Coffee
and Palia (2016), supra note 19 (“[T]he gains that activists make in trading on asymmetric information—before the
Schedule 13D’s filing—come at the expense of selling shareholders. . . . Disclosure that is delayed ten days enables
activists to profit from trading on asymmetric information over that period . . . .”).
215 See, e.g., Alon Brav, Wei Jiang, Frank Partnoy, and Randall Thomas, Hedge Fund Activism, Corporate
Governance, and Firm Performance, 63.4 THE JOURNAL OF FINANCE 1729-1775 (2008) (finding “The abnormal
return around the announcement of activism is approximately 7%, with no reversal during the subsequent year.”);
see also April Klein and Emanuel Zur, Entrepreneurial Shareholder Activism: Hedge Funds and Other Private
Investors, 64.1 THE JOURNAL OF FINANCE 187-229 (2009) (finding “a significantly positive market reaction for the
target firm around the initial Schedule 13D filing date, significantly positive returns over the subsequent year.”));

JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE 323-336 (2008) (“Firms targeted by activists earn an average cumulative

find that the filing of a Schedule 13D is associated with large positive average abnormal returns,
in the range of 7% to 8%, during the [–20,+20] announcement window, and about 2% during the
filing day and the following day. 216 Similar to Brav et al. (2008), Klein and Zur (2009) document
that issuers targeted by hedge funds earn a mean market-adjusted abnormal return of 5.5% over
the [-30, +5] window around the initial Schedule 13D filing date and 7.2% for the [-30, +30]
period around the filing. Extending the analysis by Brav et al. (2008) to more recent years,
Barry, Brav and Jiang (2020) report an average abnormal return about 4.5% over the [-20, 20]
window.217 Therefore, during any delay between a market-moving event and the Schedule 13D
filing, securities are likely to be mispriced relative to a full-information benchmark, and
information asymmetry between Schedule 13D filers and those with whom they share the
information, and the rest of the market, is greater than otherwise. The prolonged delay could,
therefore, harm the investors who happen to sell their shares during the 10-day window. As
discussed in Section III.A, we are not able to quantify the potential harm to investors due to data
limitations. If an initial Schedule 13D were required to be filed more promptly, those investors
might be able to sell their shares at a higher price, or they may re-evaluate their investment
decisions. Timelier reporting would also allow other market participants, such as analysts and
investment advisers, to better value the securities and make better recommendations. We

recognize that the benefit of more timely reporting to investors and other market participants
could be offset by the costs to blockholders and other investors as a result of the proposed
amendment’s effect on shareholder activism. We discuss these offsetting costs in more detail
below in Section III.C.b.i.
Additionally, academic studies have shown that information asymmetry has a first-order
effect on liquidity. 218 Thus, the proposed amendment, by reducing information asymmetry,
would provide incremental benefits to investors in general through the increased liquidity of the
shares of the companies subject to Schedule 13D filings. The Commission implicitly recognized
the importance of this point when it accelerated deadlines for Form 4 and Form 8-K filings, as
discussed above. 219
We also are proposing to amend Rule 13d-2(a) to require that all amendments to
Schedule 13D be filed within one business day after the material change that triggers the
amendment obligation. Rule 13d-2(a) currently requires a Schedule 13D amendment to be filed
“promptly” to disclose a material change. The benefits of this proposed amendment to Rule 13d2(a) are very similar to the benefits of our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(a) discussed
above. More timely reporting would facilitate price discovery in the market, reduce information
asymmetry and mispricing, and therefore allow investors to make more informed investment
decisions. In addition, as discussed above, replacing the “promptly” requirement with a brightline requirement would provide greater clarity as to when material changes are to be disclosed,
which could reduce filer confusion and improve compliance. The positive economic effect on
the information environment and investor decision-making associated with our proposed

218 See, e.g., Lawrence Glosten and Paul Milgrom, Bid, Ask, and Transaction Prices in a Specialist Market with
Heterogeneously Informed Investors, 14 THE JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS 71-100 (1985).
219 We recognize that the accelerated deadlines apply, in the case of Form 8-K filings, to issuers, and rely on
different statutory authorities compared to deadlines for Schedule 13D filings. However, their economic effects on
liquidity are similar. See also supra note 26.
124
amendment to Rule 13d-1(a) also apply to our proposed conforming revisions to Rules 13d-1(e),
(f), and (g).
ii. Schedule 13G filing deadlines
We are also proposing amendments to Rules 13d-1(b), (c), and (d), and Rules 13d-2(b),
(c), and (d) to shorten other reporting deadlines under Regulation 13D–G, which govern the
deadlines for initial Schedule 13G filings and Schedule 13G amendments.
As discussed above, currently, under Rules 13d-1(b), (c), and (d), for beneficial owners
with reporting obligations who are eligible to file a Schedule 13G, the filing deadlines for the
initial Schedule 13G are 45 days after the end of calendar year for QIIs and Exempt Investors if
they beneficially own more than 5% of a covered class as of the last day of the calendar year, and
within 10 days of acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a covered class for Passive
Investors. Under the current rules, QIIs and Exempt Investors may avoid beneficial ownership
reporting altogether by selling down their positions before the end of the year. As discussed in
Section II.A.4.b., the avoidance of beneficial ownership reporting enabled by these reporting
deadlines could undermine the informational benefits of reporting under Sections 13(d) and
13(g). Together with Section 13(d), Section 13(g) was intended to provide a “comprehensive
disclosure system of corporate ownership” applicable to all persons who are the beneficial
owners of more than 5% of a covered class.220 Information regarding beneficial ownership is
important to the market, regardless whether it is disclosed on Schedule 13D or 13G. There is
evidence that the initial filing of Schedule 13G, like that of Schedule 13D, generates a positive
stock price reaction, albeit smaller in magnitude. 221 Therefore, the avoidance of beneficial

220 See 43 FR 18484 (Apr. 28, 1978), supra notes 51 and 52.
221 See, e.g., Alex Edmans, Vivian W. Fang, and Emanuel Zur, The Effect of Liquidity on Governance, 26.6 THE
REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES 1443-1482 (2013) (finding that Schedule 13G filings generate on average
125
ownership reporting on Schedule 13G made possible in part by the extended length of time in
which certain beneficial owners have to report, if at all, could contribute to information
asymmetry and mispricing in the market. As with the Schedule 13D filings, the prolonged delay
in Schedule 13G reporting could harm the investors who happen to sell their shares in the days
before the filing. To address this concern, we are proposing to shorten the filing deadlines for an
initial Schedule 13G to (1) no more than five business days after the end of the month in which
their beneficial ownership exceeds 5% of a covered class for QIIs and Exempt Investors, and (2)
five days after acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a covered class for Passive
Investors.
By shortening the initial Schedule 13G deadlines, the proposed amendments would
reduce the opportunities for these holders to avoid their reporting obligations and improve
transparency. Academic research has provided evidence that Schedule 13G filings contain
value-relevant information—i.e., they are shown to lead to positive announcement returns and
improvements in firm operating performance. 222 Therefore, timely reporting of value-relevant
information would facilitate price discovery and reduce information asymmetry and mispricing
in the market, benefiting investors and other market participants similar to our proposed
shortening of the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline.
The proposed amendments would also shorten reporting deadlines for Schedule 13G
amendments under Rules 13d-2(b), (c), and (d). We believe the potential benefits of shortening

initial Schedule 13G filing deadlines discussed above also apply to the accelerated filing of the
Schedule 13G amendments.
b. Costs
i. Schedule 13D filing deadlines
It could be costly to shorten the deadline for filing the initial Schedule 13D under Rule
13d-1(a) as proposed because it may have a negative impact on corporate control and related
shareholder engagement activities. Activists seeking to influence or control an issuer may be
deterred from undertaking initiatives to engage management or launch campaigns because of the
reduced gains in stockholder value that activists could capture and the earlier warning provided
to management as a result of the proposed amendments, according to academic research. 223 We
discuss these potential effects and mitigating factors below.
Facilitating the use of low-threshold poison pills
There is a concern that a shortened reporting deadline could give early notice to an
issuer’s management regarding a potential takeover attempt. 224 This accelerated filing deadline
thus may provide management with more of an opportunity to quickly deploy defense
mechanisms, increasing the costs for blockholders to successfully carry out their initiatives.
Bebchuk et al. (2013) argue that shortening the deadline would “enable incumbents to adopt lowtrigger poison pills that make it impossible for outside blockholders to accumulate additional
shares after they cross the five-percent threshold,” and therefore “deter outside investors from
accumulating large blocks of stock in public companies.”
While we recognize the concern that a shortened reporting deadline could aid the use of
low-threshold poison pills, the filing deadline’s impact on shareholder activism through low-

127
threshold poison pills may be overstated for several reasons. First, while the use of lowthreshold (10%-15%) poison pills has increased, such poison pills have been scrutinized by
courts, academia and industry. Issuers’ ability to adopt poison pill plans with low triggering
thresholds is limited by the requirements of state law, with courts in Delaware and other
jurisdictions scrutinizing poison pill plans under heightened judicial standards and at least one
court expressing skepticism of a poison pill plan that had a 5% triggering threshold.225 In
addition, as discussed above, legal scholars have expressed concern that these pills are too
restrictive and could negatively affect activist investors’ profits and incentives and thereby
activism. 226 Kahan and Rock (2019) have stated that pills with a threshold of 10% or 15% should
be permitted depending on the context, and that pills with a threshold of less than 10% and pills
with a “wolf-pack” trigger should be regarded as presumptively invalid, because the latter pills
are “not a reasonable response to any cognizable threat and impose excessive restrictions on the
ability of an activist to conduct a credible contest and communicate with other shareholders.”227
And the long-standing guidance of the proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services is
that the ownership trigger cannot be so low as to be unduly restrictive and recommending that

128
defensive pills generally should have a trigger no lower than 20%.228 Pills with 5% triggers are
extremely rare in practice. 229
Second, the median reported ownership on initial Schedule 13D filings are much lower
than the historically conventional triggers of about 20%, or recent precedents which tended to
cluster in the 10%-15% range. 230 As discussed above, our preliminary analysis of 2020 filings
show that the median reported accumulation was 8.4% for all initial Schedule 13D filers.
According to Barry, Brav and Jiang (2020), the median reported ownership was 6.3% in their
sample of hedge fund filers. 231 Because blockholders could potentially accumulate fewer shares
under the shortened reporting deadline, the reported ownership on initial Schedule 13D filings
may be even lower than the prevalent poison pill triggers, and therefore unlikely to trigger lowthreshold poison pills. 232
Moreover, the length of the reporting period is not likely to affect the ability of issuers to
adopt poison pill plans quickly. For example, issuers today already have the ability to implement
a poison pill plan quickly by having a “shelf” poison pill plan that could be implemented by the

issuer’s board as soon as 24 hours after the Schedule 13D filing is made. 233 This would remain
true even if we reduce the Schedule 13D deadline from 10 days to five days.
Inhibiting shareholder activism
Shortening the deadline may reduce blockholders’ profits from stock price increases
attributable to corporate governance improvements, and, as a result, reduce incentives for them
to seek influence or a change in control. Blockholders have to expend resources to succeed in
their bids to replace or influence inefficient management. They bear the costs for such
initiatives, but share the improvement in corporate efficiency and security prices with other
investors of the issuer upon the disclosure.234 By shortening the initial Schedule 13D filing
deadline, the proposed amendments would reduce opportunities for blockholders to profit from
their research and time investments that motivate large share accumulations, which could be used
to acquire more shares at lower prices, selectively inform other investors to acquire shares or for
other purposes. This inability to benefit from the observable increase in stock price after the
announcement of the presence of an activist may reduce their incentive to initiate the change. A
five-day deadline would nonetheless still allow blockholders to profit from their additional
information, as contrasted, for example, with the original Williams Act amendment requiring
prior notification. 235

raider’s improvement of the corporation, thereby seriously limiting the raider’s profit”). Note, however, that the

In addition to blockholders, the proposed change could also be costly for general
shareholders of companies that are potential targets of activist blockholders. There is evidence
from the academic literature that the presence of blockholders is associated with improved
outcomes for shareholders.236 If blockholders are disincentivized from seeking corporate control,
it is possible that value-increasing corporate changes that could happen otherwise might not take
place. 237 The finance literature indicates that companies targeted by activist hedge funds, which
are a subset of all blockholders filing Schedule 13D,238 tend to improve productivity without
increases in wages. 239 Activists also tend to relocate underused assets to more productive uses.
Additionally, studies show that the mere threat of activism incentivizes potential targets to
increase payouts to shareholders and reduce investment in the long term, as well as improve
operating performance.240
While we recognize that a shortened initial Schedule 13D filing deadline might have the
potential to inhibit shareholder activism through reduced incentives, there are several reasons to

private individuals and public companies.

and Labor Outcomes, 28.10 THE REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES 2723-2769 (2015).

Effects of Hedge Fund Activism, THE REVIEW OF FINANCE 1031-1068 (2018).
131
expect that this effect, including its impact on corporate control, would be limited. First,
academic research has shown that the presence of activist blockholders in a company is driven
by many factors, including the company’s size, the extent to which the company is undervalued,
the liquidity of its stock, its leverage and the ownership stake of its officers and directors, among
others.241 Thus, it is reasonable to expect that some of these factors may play a more important
role in a blockholder’s decision to take a stake in a company compared with the ability to obtain
a large block undetected, or to receive compensation in the form of inside knowledge. For
example, how undervalued the stock of the company is, or the size of the company, may
determine the willingness of a blockholder to obtain a stake in the company.
Second, even with a shortened filing deadline, as proposed, blockholders still stand to
gain based on their information on the day of the filing, as well as on additional information they
have regarding their plans to acquire more shares. As discussed above, Brav et al. (2008) show
that the filing day and the following day see an abnormal return about 2.0%, and that return
continues trending up to a total of 7.2% in 20 days. 242 Brav et al. (2008) also suggest that hedge
funds adopt different strategies regarding announcing their activist intent. While some launch
aggressive activism only after they have filed a Schedule 13D, some hedge funds file a Schedule
13D after publicly announcing their activist intent. These varying practices further indicate that
the gains from share accumulation prior to Schedule 13D filings is not the only way for
blockholders to profit or succeed in their activism.

REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES 1443-1482 (2013); Christopher Clifford and Laura Lindsey, Blockholder

ANALYSIS 1491-1520 (2016); Brav, Jiang, and Li, (2021), supra note 215.
242 See Brav et al. (2008), supra note 215.
132
Third, based on the statistics shown in academic research, the negative impact from the
proposed amendments might not be as severe as some have suggested. For example, according
to Barry et al. (2020), approximately 28% of their sample of activist hedge funds filed an initial
Schedule 13D within five days after crossing the 5% threshold. 243 Additionally, their subsample
analysis shows that the activist hedge funds that filed with 0-1 days and 2-4 days after crossing
5% threshold reported on average 9.6% and 9.7% ownership, both of which are actually slightly
higher than the overall average of 9.2% across all activist hedge fund filings.244 Even for funds
that accumulate large percentage ownership before filing, their ownership percentages do not
differ by much at the time of the filing. For example, the 95% percentile of activist hedge funds
that file within 0-1 days after crossing 5% threshold accumulate 20.5% ownership, which is the
same as those that file within 8-10 days after crossing the threshold. These statistics from the
study suggest that a non-trivial number of blockholders are already voluntarily filing their initial
Schedule 13D in what would be a timely manner under our proposed amendments, and the
percent ownership they are able to accumulate is comparable to those who disclose later. These
statistics suggest that it may be possible to obtain target percentages within the proposed filing
deadline. 245 In addition, academic literature suggests that, unlike the “corporate raiders” of the
1980s who sought direct control, today’s blockholders’ aim is to “influence” corporate policies

243 See Barry, Brav and Jiang (2020), supra note 217 (studying hedge fund activism events over the period 1994-
2016).
244 Id. at 12.
245 The 95th percentile of share accumulation reported in Barry et al. (2020) is approximately 20.5%. Brav et al
(2021), in describing trends in activism, note an increased importance of hedge fund activism, characterized by
lower stakes than those acquired by “corporate raiders” who sought direct control in the 1980s. See Brav, Jiang, and
Li (2021), supra note 215.
133
and governance, which requires lower levels of ownership. 246 Namely, it seems possible for
blockholders to adapt to the proposed deadline, albeit at a higher cost for some. 247 Although the
circumstances were not identical, lowering the statutory reporting threshold from 10% to 5% in
1970 did not appear to inhibit the increase in hostile takeovers and issuer deployment of
corresponding defensive measures in the following decades—indeed, corporate America
experienced a takeover wave in the 1980s.248
Fourth, regarding a shorter reporting window’s effects on shareholder activism, some
scholars contend that the concerns discussed above are overstated, because a shorter reporting
window may negatively affect short-term oriented activism more than the long-term oriented
activism. Short-term oriented activism could be suboptimal for long-term shareholders, and
therefore the shortened deadline might provide some benefit or incur less costs to long-term
shareholders by encouraging more long-term focused activism. 249 Specifically, these scholars
assert that blockholders do not always have a superior strategy—sometimes these investors could
be short-term focused, and incumbent management does not necessarily embody

246 See Brav, Jiang, and Li (2021), supra note 215.
247 It is possible that larger shareholders are more likely to be able to accumulate target amounts at faster speeds.
The speed of accumulation could also depend on the size and liquidity of the target issuer. Therefore, the proposed
amendments could affect smaller blockholders, or blockholders who are trying to acquire shares in less liquid firms,
more than others.
248 See Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny, Takeovers in the ’60s and the ’80s: Evidence and Implications,
Strategic management journal 12.S2 (1991): 51-59 (“The American economy has experienced two large takeover
waves in the postwar period: one in the 1960s and one in the 1980s. Both waves had a profound impact on the
structure of corporate America. The dominant trend in the ’60s was diversification and conglomeration. The ’80s
takeovers, in contrast, reversed this process and brought American corporations back to greater specialization.”).
249 See Coffee and Palia (2016), supra note 19, at 596 (“To sum up, the arguments against ‘closing the window’
work only if one assumes both that activists are the hero of the story and that they generate value for all
shareholders. Neither assumption seems sound, at least without substantial qualification. Nor does the fear that
closing the window will chill activism sound convincing. Activists are reaping record returns at present; the number
of such campaigns is accelerating, and fears for their future seem premature.”).
134
entrenchment.250 They argue that shortening the reporting window would not necessarily
disincentivize shareholder activism per se—while it might disincentivize short-term focused
shareholder activism because blockholders could experience reduced profit in the short-term, it
should matter less to blockholders who truly believe they could improve the firm value in the
long-term. Shortening the initial Schedule 13D reporting window has thus been recommended
as an approach to encourage longer-term holdings and deter short-term activists without
necessarily insulating managements from shareholder accountability. 251 Therefore, from this
viewpoint, to the extent that the proposed amendments could encourage blockholders to focus on
long-term value creation, they could improve corporate control. 252 We note that while the
literature shows that a price increase in a window around a Schedule 13D reporting event does
not reverse in the long term, providing evidence opposite to this view, 253 the determination of
long-term returns (e.g., over a year or more after the Schedule 13D filing), and whether there is
indeed an increase in value in the long term that can be attributed to a particular filing, is
inherently more complicated.
Shortening the initial Schedule 13D filing deadline could also increase compliance costs
for beneficial owners who have an obligation to file an initial Schedule 13D. These beneficial
owners could incur a one-time cost to update their information technology system to monitor the

250 See Coffee and Palia (2016), supra note 19, at 592 (“[A]ctivists do not always need to have a superior strategy;
indeed, some may seek to launch an activist campaign largely to roil the waters on the premise that noisy activism
will be read by the market as signaling a possible takeover or restructuring. Even when the proposed change is
flawed, those who purchase shares in the target firm before the filing of a Schedule 13D and exit at an early point
will likely profit handsomely.”), and at 593 (“If management is in fact motivated today to maximize the firm’s stock
price, attempts to limit management’s discretion through sudden and concealed activist campaigns would not
necessarily lead to optimal outcomes. Also, because management generally has better information than outsiders—
coupled with a strong incentive to maximize the firm’s stock price—one can no longer begin from the premise that
investment projects favored by management are the product of an inefficient preference for ‘empire-building.’ If that
premise was justified in its time that time is now past.”).

135
share accumulations and generate alerts and reports in time to accommodate the rule change.
They may also need to allocate more resources on an ongoing basis to monitor their holdings so
that they can meet their obligation to file an initial Schedule 13D. These compliance costs could
be significant for certain filers (e.g., those whose share accumulations need to be aggregated
across different time zones or jurisdictions).
We believe the proposed amendment to Rule 13(a)(4) of Regulation S-T, which would
extend the Schedule 13D and 13G filing “cut-off” time from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m., should
mitigate the additional compliance costs for Schedule 13D filers resulting from the proposed
amendments to Rules 13d-1(a), (e), (f), and (g). We do not think the proposed amendment to
Rule 201(a) of Regulation S-T would have any significant cost or benefit. While the proposed
amendment would make temporary hardship exemptions unavailable to filers of Schedules 13D
and 13G, as discussed in Section II.A.6.b., the proposed treatment is consistent our treatment of
Forms 3, 4 and 5, and the proposed amendments to Rule 13(a)(4) should avoid the need for such
hardship exemptions.
Finally, we note that the compliance costs and mitigating factors discussed above also
would apply to our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-2(a) that would shorten the filing deadline
for Schedule 13D amendments.
ii. Schedule 13G filing deadlines
Accelerated Schedule 13G filings (for both initial filings and amendments) under our
proposed amendments to Rules 13d-1(b), (c), and (d) and Rules 13d-2(b), (c), and (d) could
potentially impose costs on filers. These costs may appear to be significant for QIIs because the
proposed amendments to Rules 13d-1(b) and 13d-2(b) and (c) would significantly shorten the
filing deadlines for these holders and potentially increase their filing frequency. Under the
proposed amendments to Rules 13d-1(b) and 13d-2(b), QIIs would be required to file an initial
and amended Schedule 13G, respectively, no more than five business days after the end of the
136
month in which their beneficial ownership exceeds 5% of a covered class or a material change
occurs. This deadline is significantly shorter than the current deadline of 45 days after the end of
the calendar year for both an initial and amended Schedule 13G filing. In addition, under the
proposed amendments to Rule 13d-2(c), QIIs would be required to file an amendment to their
Schedule 13G within five days after the date on which their beneficial ownership exceeds 10%
of a covered class, or increases or decreases by more than 5% of the covered class once across
the 10% threshold, rather than the current requirement of 10 days after the end of the relevant
month.
While shortening the filing deadlines could improve the timeliness of Schedule 13G
reporting and market efficiency, it could also negatively impact some filers, particularly some
QIIs (e.g., mutual funds or hedge funds). The existing academic literature identifies free riding
and front running as explanations for why more timely disclosure would negatively impact fund
performance, and provides evidence that mutual funds experienced reduced returns after the
Commission required more frequent portfolio disclosure.254 The finding of a reduction in returns
may be attributable to several factors, according to the literature. First, more timely filings may
reveal a fund’s proprietary information or trading strategies to other market participants, thus
allowing those participants to free ride by copying the fund’s strategies without incurring a cost
to research, identify and devise profitable strategies.255 Funds typically need to expend

Disclosure of Registered Management Investment Companies, 17 CFR parts 210, 239, 249, 270, and 274, Release
Nos. 33-8393; 34-49333; IC-26372; File No. S7-51-02 [69 FR 11244 (March 9, 2004)], available at
https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8393.htm#IIB4. Notably, the Commission decided to adopt the quarterly
disclosure requirement with a 60-day delay as opposed to the 45-day delay or monthly reporting as some had
suggested, citing the concerns that “more frequent portfolio holdings disclosure and/or a shorter delay for release of
this information may expand the opportunities for predatory trading practices that harm fund shareholders.”
255 See Russ Wermers, The Potential Effects of More Frequent Portfolio Disclosure on Mutual Fund Performance,
7.3 Perspective 1-11 (2001).
137
considerable resources to research and identify promising investments, and profits from the
research take time to accrue. For example, it is estimated that it could take 12 to 18 months for
mutual funds to profit after the date a newly acquired stock is first added to a fund’s portfolio.
Therefore, more timely disclosure would provide free-riding opportunities for other investors to
mimic or reverse engineer a fund’s strategy, which could ultimately diminish a fund’s return.256
Second, more timely disclosure could increase the risk that funds would be front run by outside
investors. Specifically, more timely disclosure could potentially allow professional investors to
better understand a fund’s strategies and anticipate trades of the fund. Therefore, those
professional investors may attempt to trade ahead of the funds to capture the temporary impact
on prices of traded securities.257 As a result, funds could see an increase in trading costs and a
decrease in returns.
While most of the literature focuses on mutual fund portfolio disclosure when discussing
the tradeoff between timely reporting and fund performance, we believe the tradeoff between
timely reporting and fund performance can be applied to the Schedule 13G reporting by QIIs.
The proposed amendment to the initial Schedule 13G deadline (shortening the deadline to five
business days after the end of the applicable month) would be a significant change for QIIs
considering both the current deadline (45 days after the applicable calendar year) and the filing

requirements for other forms that QIIs generally file (including the 60-day deadline for Form NQ as discussed above, and the 45-day deadline for Form 13F). The accelerated deadline under
the proposed amendments could reveal valuable information about a fund’s investment
strategies, facilitate free riding and front running behaviors, and therefore potentially reduce a
fund’s returns and harm fund shareholders. In the long run, the proposed accelerated disclosure
requirements could reduce incentives for funds to collect and process information, leading to
market inefficiency.
We recognize that the proposed accelerated filing requirements could potentially increase
the risks of free riding or front running for certain Schedule 13G filers. However, we also note
that Schedule 13G filings are different from portfolio disclosures such as Form N-Q or Form
13F. Schedule 13G filings do not have a set frequency and do not require a disclosure of a
fund’s entire portfolio. Thus, these filings are unlikely to provide information with the level of
precision and predictability needed for free riding or front running purposes. Therefore, we
believe the risks of increased free riding and front running as a result of the proposed
amendments are likely to be low.
Shortening Schedule 13G filing deadlines could also generate compliance costs for filers.
QIIs may incur a one-time cost to update their information technology systems to monitor share
accumulations and generate alerts and reports in time to accommodate the rule change. They
may also need to allocate more resources on an ongoing basis to monitor material changes so
they can meet their obligations to file amendments to Schedule 13G. However, as mentioned in
Section II.A.3.b., because these holders with reporting obligations typically have compliance
systems to monitor Schedule 13G filing obligations on at least a monthly basis (e.g., in case their
holdings exceed more than 10% at the end of the month), the ongoing cost could be mitigated.
Overall, we believe the compliance costs to QIIs should be minor.

For Passive Investors, the filing deadline for an initial Schedule 13G would be shortened
from 10 days to five days under the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-1(c). The proposed
amendment to Rule 13d-2(b) would accelerate the filing deadline for Schedule 13G amendments
from the current standard of 45 days after the end of the calendar year to within five business
days of the end of the month in which a material change occurs. In addition, the proposed
amendment to Rule 13d-2(d) would change the Schedule 13G amendment deadline for Passive
Investors from the current “promptly” standard to five days after the date on which their
beneficial ownership exceeds 10% of a covered class, or increases or decreases by more than 5%
once across the 10% threshold. Similar to QIIs, Passive Investors may incur a one-time cost to
update their information technology systems to monitor share accumulations in order to
accommodate the rule change. They may also need to allocate more resources to monitor
material changes on an ongoing basis so they can meet their obligations to file amendments to
Schedule 13G in a more timely manner.
Exempt Investors would be required to file an initial and amended Schedule 13G no more
than five business days after the end of the month in which their beneficial ownership exceeds
5% or a material change occurs under the proposed amendments to Rules 13d-1(d) and 13d-2(b),
as compared to the current deadlines of 45 days after the end of calendar year for both initial and
amended Schedule 13G filings. As a result, Exempt Investors may also incur one-time and
continuing compliance costs as a result of the proposed amendments.
Passive Investors and Exempt Investors should not incur the economic costs associated
with the risk of free-riding and front-running that QIIs would, because they do not actively
manage their portfolios like QIIs do. However, the compliance costs to Passive Investors and
Exempt Investors may be relatively higher than those to QIIs. Specifically, neither Passive
Investors nor Exempt Investors currently need to monitor their beneficial ownership levels on a
140
monthly basis as QIIs do to determine whether their holdings exceed more than 10% at the end
of the month and trigger an initial Schedule 13G filing pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(2).
For all Schedule 13G filers, an increase in compliance costs may reduce their incentive to
invest in smaller public companies, where equity holdings could more easily cross the 5%
threshold. This could ultimately reduce the liquidity of these issuers’ equity securities and
potentially their incentives to be listed on an exchange.
We are unable to quantify the potential increase in costs related to the proposed shortened
Schedule 13D and 13G filing deadlines due to the lack of data. For example, we lack data to
estimate how the proposed amendments would affect blockholders’ ability to initiate corporate
change because such ability would depend on their target share accumulation level, the liquidity
of their target stocks and their acquisition plans. Regarding Schedule 13G filings, the potential
increase in costs would depend on a filer’s investment strategy and frequency of disclosure after
the rule change. Because we do not have all the inputs for these variables, we cannot provide a
reasonable estimate for these costs.
2. Proposed Amendment to Rule 13d-3
a. Benefits
The proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3 would deem holders of certain cash-settled
derivative securities as beneficial owners of the reference securities in a covered class. Overall,
we believe this proposed amendment could improve transparency, promote market stability and
ultimately enhance investor protection.
First, the proposed amendment could benefit investors and other market participants by
providing improved transparency regarding persons with significant economic interests in an
issuer’s equity securities and potential control intent. Under current Rule 13d-3, it is possible for
holders of cash-settled derivative securities to acquire economic exposure to substantial blocks of
securities without public disclosure because those instruments generally do not convey voting or
141
investment power over the reference equity security. However, academic literature has raised
concern over the “hidden ownership” through cash-settled equity-based derivatives, because in
many cases, holders of such derivative securities may have the de facto ability to procure votes
quickly when needed.258 According to these studies, counterparties to these derivative contracts
commonly hedge their risks by purchasing the reference shares related to these contracts and, at
the end of the contract when those share are no longer needed, sell the shares to reduce their
exposure.259 It is convenient, and sometimes even expected (e.g., in the U.K.), for counterparties
to sell these shares back to their customers, the holders of the cash-settled derivative securities. 260
Alternatively, the holder of the derivative security and the counterparty can always try to modify

258 See Henry T.C. Hu, and Bernard Black, Hedge Funds, Insiders, and the Decoupling of Economic and Voting
Ownership: Empty Voting and Hidden (Morphable) Ownership, 13.2-3 JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE 343-367
(2007); see also Pierre-Henri Conac, Cash-Settled Derivatives as a Takeover Instrument and the Reform of the EU
Transparency Directive, in THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL MARKET IN TRANSITION 49-68 (2011).
259 See, e.g., Pierre-Henri Conac (2011), at 51 (stating “[a]lthough it seems that CSDs [cash-settled derivatives] are
not equivalent for the investor to holding the shares, the reality can be quite different. The reason is that banks do
not want to face the risk that the price of the share increases and they have to pay the difference. Therefore, in order
to hedge their risk, they usually purchase the underlying shares relating to the CSDs. At the end of the contract, the
banks will normally sell their shares in the market in order to pay to the investor the difference with the price at the
beginning of the contract. Even if the bank does not do so, it will not keep the shares once the contract terminates
since it usually has no use of the shares. This is especially the case if the CSDs relate to a large number of shares,
unless the bank is interested in keeping an exposure to this company which is usually not the case. Then, nothing
prevents the investor from purchasing the shares that the bank is selling in the open market. Alternatively, the
investor and the bank can decide before the end of the contract to modify it in order that the contract will not be
settled in cash but will be settled physically by delivery of the underlying shares. Therefore, if the bank holds the
shares in order to hedge its risk, the investor is during the life of the CSD a quasi-shareholder, except that subject to
the contractual agreement, he usually does not control the voting rights attached to the shares held by the bank.”);
see also Eugenio de Nardis, and Matteo Tonello, Know your shareholders: the use of cash-settled equity derivatives
to hide corporate ownership interests, Conference Board Director Notes No. DN-009, 2010 (stating “The
derivatives dealer (i.e., the short party in the derivatives transaction) often holds the underlying securities as a hedge
against its short position. Especially in those cases where the equity swap involves a substantial amount of shares of
a single company, hedging with matched shares may be the only commercially sound choice for the dealer, as
alternative hedging strategies are likely to be limited and more expensive.”).
260 See Henry T.C. Hu and Bernard Black (2007), supra note 258 (stating that in the U.K., it is “frequently the
expectation” of a long equity swap holder that the dealer would “ensure” that shares are available to be voted by its
customer or sold to the customer on closing out the swap). But see Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock, Anti-Activist
Poison Pills, 99 B.U. L. REV. 915, 948-953 (2019) (taking a different view regarding cash-settled derivative
securities’ effectiveness in achieving activists’ objectives in the context of poison pills and arguing that synthetic
equity confers no voting rights, and hence poses no threats that should be counted toward a poison pill triggering
threshold).
142
the terms of a derivative security to settle the contract by transferring the reference securities
instead of cash. Therefore, cash-settled derivative securities could ultimately be settled in kind.
This optionality allows holders of the derivatives to have the ability to influence or control an
issuer without triggering public disclosure. Indeed, there have been takeover attempts using this
de facto ability to quickly acquire shares.261
Holders of cash-settled derivative securities could also influence or control an issuer in
other ways. For example, they might try to influence the counterparties to vote any hedged
shares according to their desire. Additionally, any shares used in a hedge would be eliminated
from the universe of voting shares as a result of the derivative contract, altering the balance of
the voting power.262 Of course, there is no guaranteed success through these approaches.
However, significant economic interest could confer some credibility upon the activist with other
shareholders,263 which could increase the likelihood of success.
Section 13(d) requires public disclosure of the rapid accumulation of sizable positions
linked to equity ownership by investors with potential control intent. As discussed above,
information related to a potential change in corporate control is material to the market, and
withholding the information could lead to information asymmetry and mispricing in the
market.264 Therefore, by expanding the scope of beneficial ownership to include certain holders

261 See, e.g., The Case of Volkswagen, THE HEDGE FUND JOURNAL, Nov. 2008 (available at
https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-case-of-volkswagen/). While most of the examples referenced in this
discussion involve European transactions or cash-settled security-based-swaps (which are excluded from the
proposed amendments), the underlying mechanism for exercising influence over the voting, acquisition or
disposition of reference securities is the same as for other cash-settled derivative securities. See also supra Section
II.B.1 and note 88.
262 See Wachtell Petition, supra note 16.
263 See Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock (2019), supra note 260, at 950 (“While synthetic equity entails no voting
rights, it enables an activist shareholder to increase its economic stake and confers some credibility upon the activist
with other shareholders (albeit presumably less than actual share ownership).”).
264 See supra Section III.C.1.A.i.
143
of cash-settled derivative securities, the proposed amendments would address concerns regarding
large shareholders using “hidden ownership” to avoid their reporting obligations. Treating such
holders as beneficial owners also would reduce information asymmetries and enhance investor
protection. Greater transparency would allow investors to make more informed investment
decisions and help other market participants to better evaluate securities.
Enhanced disclosure could also promote market stability. Rapid accumulation of large
equity positions could impact the liquidity of a covered class, and the lack of disclosure could
prevent the market from incorporating that liquidity risk into the pricing for the security.
Therefore, an unwinding of the positions could lead to excessive volatility and adversely impact
the stock price of an issuer.
b. Costs
Deeming certain holders of cash-settled derivative securities to be a beneficial owner may
result in new entrants to the Sections 13(d), 13(g), and 16 reporting systems, and thus generate
increased costs for those who previously were not subject to these regulations. These persons
may incur more extensive and ongoing compliance costs due to their reporting obligations under
these provisions. For example, as discussed in Section II.B.2., a person who holds a derivative
security with variable delta would need to calculate the delta on a daily basis, for purposes of
determining the number of equity securities that such person will be deemed to beneficially own.
In addition, persons who would become ten percent holders as a result of proposed Rule 13d-3(e)
would be subject to Section 16(b)’s short-swing profit liability and Section 16(c)’s short sale
prohibitions.
The proposed amendment could also potentially reduce the incentive to use cash-settled
derivatives for hedging purposes, especially when hedging large positions. The financial
institutions that serve as counterparties to cash-settled derivatives could be negatively affected
because the reduced use of cash-settled derivatives could result in loss in revenue. However, we
144
believe the impact on hedging incentives should be limited. If holders of derivative securities
have an economic reason to use derivative securities to limit their market risk exposure, the
potential compliance costs should be small compared to the downside of not using them. In
addition, we are proposing Rule 13d-6(d) to provide that two or more persons will not be deemed
to have formed a group under Section 13(d)(3) or 13(g)(3) solely by virtue of their entrance into
an agreement governing the terms of a derivative security. This proposed exemption seeks to
avoid impediments to certain financial institutions’ ability to conduct their business in the
ordinary course, which, we believe, could mitigate some of the costs imposed on financial
institutions.
We are unable to quantify these costs related to beneficial ownership disclosure, because
we lack data on the current use of cash-settled derivative securities to provide reasonable
estimates on how such use would change.
3. Proposed Amendments to Rules 13d-5 and 13d-6
a. Benefits
The Commission is proposing a series of amendments to Rule 13d-5 to clarify and affirm
its operation as applied to two or more persons who “act as” a group under Sections 13(d)(3) and
(g)(3) of the Exchange Act.
265 Current Rule 13d-5(b) states that when two or more persons
“agree to act together” for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of equity
securities of an issuer, then the group that is formed has acquired beneficial ownership of the
securities. The intent of the rule, together with Sections 13(d)(3) and (g)(3), is to prevent
investors from coordinating to circumvent the 5% threshold in Sections 13(d) and (g). However,

265 See supra Section II.C.
145
recent academic research has underscored concerns that groups of blockholders may work
together to gain control of corporate boards without making appropriate disclosure.266
The proposed amendments would remove the potential for Rule 13d-5(b) to be construed
as requiring that an express or implied agreement exists between two or more persons before a
group can be formed. By clarifying and affirming that an express or implied agreement is not
needed to subject a group to regulation under Section 13(d) or 13(g), the proposed amendments
would avoid misinterpretation of the rule, help ensure that the law is applied as it was intended to
be, and improve transparency. Investors and other market participants would benefit to the
extent that they receive more timely disclosure to make more informed investment decisions or
better evaluate securities as a result of the proposed amendments.
b. Costs
To the extent that blockholders misinterpreted Rule 13d-5 as requiring an express or
implied agreement before they are required to report their collective holdings, these blockholders
may incur a cost as a result of the proposed amendments. For example, blockholders seeking to
coordinate with other investors for corporate influence or control might no longer be able to
avoid reporting because there is no express or implied agreement among the members. These
blockholders would thus incur additional compliance costs related to the filing of Schedule 13D.
Considering that the proposed amendments would also shorten the filing deadlines for Schedule
13D, it could be particularly costly for members to keep track of the shares purchased as a group
and coordinate among themselves in order to file on time. Additionally, such a group of
blockholders, to the extent its beneficial ownership exceeded 10% of a covered class, would be

266 See, e.g., Carmen X. W. Lu, Unpacking Wolf Packs, 125 YALE L.J. 773, 775-76, 777 (2016) (observing that wolf
packs, which may not be deemed groups by some courts despite “empirical and anecdotal evidence of coordination”
if there is not “specific evidence of coordination,” are able to evade Section 13(d) reporting if, for instance, “each of
the activist investors acquires less than a five percent stake in the target”); see also John C. Coffee, Jr. and Darius
Palia, supra notes 19 and 143.
146
deemed a “beneficial owner” as defined under Rule 16a-1(a)(1). Under our administration of
Section 16, each group member would be considered a 10% holder subject to Sections 16(a), (b),
and (c). Thus, such blockholders may incur additional compliance costs for their filing
obligations under Section 16.
Further, it could be more costly for blockholders to use group formation to influence or
change corporate control, to the extent that they misinterpreted Rule 13d-5 as requiring an
express or implied agreement, because they would no longer be able to accumulate shares at a
pre-disclosure price as they might have done under such a misimpression. As we have discussed
in Section III.C.1.b., if earlier disclosure were made, stock prices would likely increase, and,
therefore, blockholders would have to acquire shares at a higher price and the profit they would
expect to receive would be reduced. As a result, it is possible that the proposed amendments
could chill shareholder engagement. Reduced shareholder engagement may result in less
monitoring of an issuer’s management by shareholders. Because of the principal-agent
relationship between investors and management in a corporation, there may exist conflicts
between management of the issuer and investors.267 Thus, less monitoring by investors as a
result of reduced shareholder engagement could negatively affect firm value. However, we note
that these are the costs blockholders or large shareholders should have incurred anyway when
forming a group for purposes of Section 13(d), and in this regard, the proposed amendments
would not expand, but rather would clarify and affirm, the applicability of existing reporting
obligations.
Additionally, by removing any potential misimpression that an agreement must exist for
determining whether a group is formed, the proposed amendments could potentially chill

267 See Michael C. Jensen, and William H. Meckling, Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and
ownership structure, 3.4 JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS 305-360 (1976).
147
shareholder communications in general, as shareholders may be uncertain whether their
coordination constitutes “acting as” a group. As discussed in Section II.D.1., shareholders may
choose to communicate with one another regarding an issuer’s performance or a certain policy
matter, and they may take similar action with respect to the issuer or its securities, such as
aligning their voting of shares at the issuer’s annual meeting with respect to one or more
proposals. We recognize the potential risk of chilling such communications. We therefore are
also proposing amendments to Rule 13d-6 to exempt certain actions taken by two or more
persons from the scope of Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3). In addition to proposed Rule 13d6(d), which we discussed in Section III.C.2.b above, proposed Rule 13d-6(c) would provide that
two or more persons will not be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of, or otherwise
beneficially own, an issuer’s equity securities as a group solely because of their concerted
actions related to an issuer or its equity securities, including engagement with one another or the
issuer. This exemption would only be available if such persons, when taking such concerted
actions, are not directly or indirectly obligated to take such actions and communications among
or between such persons are not undertaken with the purpose or the effect of changing or
influencing control of the issuer. This exemption would, therefore, exclude activity that is not
contemplated within the purpose of Section 13(d). Additionally, to the extent beneficial owners
qualify for and rely on the proposed exemptions in Rule 13d-6, those exemptions may offset any
potential increase in the number of persons who become 10% holders as a result of our proposed
amendments to Rule 13d-5. Thus, the proposed exemptions in Rule 13d-6 may lower the
potential compliance costs associated with filings under Section 16 that are generated by the
proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5. We believe the proposed exemption could alleviate the
concern that the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5 could chill communications among
shareholders and shareholders’ engagement with issuers for reasons that do not implicate the
purpose of Section 13(d).
148
We are unable to quantify the costs of our amendments related to group formation.
Because we lack data on how many groups may not be reporting beneficial ownership because of
the misimpression that an agreement is required, we cannot provide reasonable estimates on how
such reporting practices would change.
4. Proposed Amendments to Item 6 of Schedule 13D
Item 6 of Schedule 13D provides that beneficial owners must describe “any contracts,
arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise)” with respect to any securities
of the issuer, and cash-settled derivative securities have not been expressly identified in the list
of examples. The proposed amendment would make it explicit that cash-settled derivative
securities (including cash-settled security-based swaps) that use the issuer’s securities as a
reference security are included among the types of contracts, arrangements, understandings and
relationships that must be disclosed.
We believe the proposed amendment is consistent with the proposed amendment to Rule
13d-3 discussed in Section II.B. We also believe it is consistent with our goal of modernizing
the beneficial ownership reporting requirements and improving their operation and efficacy.
Given that the baseline disclosure requirement was set forth in 1968, and the derivative securities
market has evolved significantly since then, investors would benefit if the language of the
disclosure requirement reflects current market practice and the range of instruments that should
be disclosed as contemplated by Section 13(d)(1)(E). By revising Item 6 to clarify what
instruments are covered, the proposed amendments could improve compliance with Rules 13d1(a) and 13d-101, and reduce potential ambiguity as well as litigation risk for filers. To the
extent that the proposed amendment would enhance beneficial ownership reporting, investors
and the market would benefit. However, filers could incur additional compliance costs, to the
extent that they have not already been providing such disclosure.
5. Proposed Structured Data Requirement for Schedules 13D and 13G
149
The proposed amendments would require all disclosures reported on Schedules 13D and
13G other than the exhibits to be submitted using a structured, machine-readable data
language—specifically, in 13D/G-specific XML. Currently, Schedules 13D and 13G are
submitted in HTML or ASCII, neither of which is a structured data language; as such, the
disclosures currently reported on Schedules 13D and 13G are not machine-readable. This aspect
of the proposed amendments is expected to benefit investors and markets by facilitating the use
and analysis, both by the public and by the Commission, of the ownership disclosures reported
by filing persons on Schedules 13D and 13G, compared to the current baseline. We expect this
would improve the public dissemination and accessibility of material information about potential
change of control transactions.
We anticipate that the incremental costs associated with requiring reporting persons to
submit the information disclosed on Schedules 13D and 13G in 13D/G-specific XML, compared
to the baseline of submitting the Schedules in in HTML or ASCII, would be relatively low.
Because we would provide reporting persons with the option of using a fillable web form that
converts inputted disclosures into 13D/G-specific XML, the proposed structuring requirement
would not impose upon filers without structured data experience the implementation costs of
establishing related compliance processes and expertise. Filers who choose to submit directly in
13D/G-specific XML rather than use the web form may incur the aforementioned
implementation costs, with costs varying based on their prior experience with encoding and
transmitting structured disclosures.
D. Anticipated Effects on Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation
We believe the proposed amendments together could have a positive effect on market
efficiency, but there may be some offsetting effects as well. As discussed above, currently, large
shareholders could use the 10-day window to accumulate a level of beneficial ownership far
exceeding the 5% threshold before reporting. They could seek to avoid the 5% reporting
150
threshold through the use of cash-settled derivative securities or refrain from communicating or
undertaking actions that could result in the formation of groups. By shortening Schedule 13D
and 13G filing deadlines, expanding the scope of beneficial ownership to include holders of
certain cash-settled derivative securities, and, clarifying and affirming that an actual agreement is
not needed for the formation of a group, the proposed amendments could help ensure that large
shareholders, including groups, comply with the reporting threshold, and therefore improve
disclosure regarding material information related to potential changes of corporate control. More
timely and enhanced disclosure would reduce information asymmetry and mispricing in the
market, thereby improving liquidity and market efficiency. More efficient prices and more
liquid markets help allocate capital to its most efficient uses. By making material information
available to the public sooner, and reducing the differential access to information, the proposed
amendments could increase public trust in markets, thereby aiding in capital formation. Finally,
we believe that the proposed amendments could promote competition in that those who delay
reporting would not have an advantage over similarly situated shareholders who report earlier.
Furthermore, lowering information asymmetry could also increase competition among market
participants. For example, if blockholders selectively reveal information, this gives some market
participants advantages over others.
On the other hand, we recognize that some aspect of the proposed amendments could
increase the costs of accumulating large blocks of shares. If some investors choose not to trade
when they otherwise might have, capital formation, and therefore market efficiency, could be
harmed. However, this cost would be offset by increased liquidity that arises from reducing
information asymmetry.
Furthermore, because accumulating large blocks may be more expensive, investors may
be less incentivized to do so. To the extent that large blocks aid in monitoring managerial
behavior or facilitating changes in corporate control for inefficient management, capital
151
formation could be adversely effected. By reducing the ability of blockholders to engage in
“tipping,” enhanced disclosure also would lower private benefits from accumulating blocks,
potentially reducing the incentives for blockholders to initiate corporate change. However, while
rents to the business of initiating corporate change may fall, general access to information would
increase, offsetting the effects described.
E. Reasonable Alternatives
1. Alternative Filing Deadlines
As an alternative to the proposed amendments, we considered alternative filing deadlines
for an initial Schedule 13D. For example, we considered filing deadlines that are longer than the
proposed five days but shorter than the current 10-day deadline. These alternatives would reduce
the compliance costs for filers, especially those with operations in different jurisdictions or time
zones. They would also allow blockholders to accumulate more shares before making their
filings, reducing the concern that the five-day deadline could discourage shareholder activism
and encourage management entrenchment. However, these alternatives would result in less
timely reporting, and be less beneficial to investors, other market participants and the overall
efficiency of the market. We also considered filing deadlines that are shorter than the proposed
five-day deadline. These alternative deadlines would provide more timely reporting to investors
and market. However, they could have more negative effects on shareholder activism.
We also considered shortening the deadline for QIIs to file an initial Schedule 13G to 45
days after the end of the quarter, instead of the proposed deadline of five business days after the
end of the applicable month. This approach would be more in line with the current portfolio
reporting requirement for institutional investors and mutual funds for Form 13F and Form N-Q,
and could reduce the potential risk of free riding or front running as discussed in Section
III.C.1.b.ii and the costs to QIIs as a result. On the other hand, similar to the alternative
Schedule 13D deadline, this alternative Schedule 13G deadline would provide less timely
152
disclosure compared to the proposed approach, and thus be of less benefit to investors and the
market.
2. Tiered Approach and Purchasing Moratorium
We understand that certain persons who would be required to file a Schedule 13D under a
shortened deadline could view an earlier deadline as a means of forfeiting a proprietary trading
strategy or minimizing the opportunity to earn a return that is high enough to offset their research
costs and litigation, reputational and investment risks. Rather than shortening the deadline in all
instances, we also considered a tiered approach, such as maintaining the 10-day deadline for
acquisitions of greater than 5% but no more than 10% while instituting a shorter deadline if
beneficial ownership exceeds 10%. We also considered whether the deadline for the initial
Schedule 13D filing should vary based on a particular characteristic of the issuer, such as its
market capitalization or trading volume. A tiered approach would affect fewer filers than the
proposed deadlines discussed above, and thus would be less costly. A tiered approach also
would result in less timely reporting than the proposed approach, providing less benefit to
investors and the market.
Finally, we also considered maintaining the 10-day deadline if the filer “stands still” by
not acquiring additional beneficial ownership once the 5% threshold has been crossed and until
the Schedule 13D is filed. This approach would differentiate between investors seeking to
establish a small minority stake and those seeking to exert influence or accumulate a control
position, including beneficial ownership amounting to a majority or more of the covered class.
While this approach would be the most effective in enforcing the 5% threshold, it could also be
the most costly in terms of its impact on shareholder activism. It would effectively place a speed
bump on blockholders’ acquisitions, and provide opportunities for management to defend and
entrench themselves. In addition, it might be operationally difficult to ensure that the purchases
of the shares add up to no more than 5%, especially when shares are purchased from different
153
sources, or purchases are made by different entities. Further, this alternative would not increase
the timeliness of Schedule 13D reporting, and thus would not provide the same benefits to
investors and the market as the proposal. Rather than propose a deadline based upon a person’s
willingness to abstain from making additional acquisitions once the 5% threshold has been
crossed, we instead have solicited comment on the efficacy of such an alternative while taking
into account the operational difficulties associated with a person’s attempt to acquire no more
than the minimum reportable amount of beneficial ownership.
3. Consolidate Beneficial Ownership Reporting
We also considered consolidating beneficial reporting into one form, Schedule 13D (i.e.,
by eliminating Schedule 13G). This approach would include a reduction in some of the
compliance burdens applicable to former Schedule 13G filers that would now be required to file
a Schedule 13D. For example, because there would be only one form, former Schedule 13G
filers would no longer need to monitor their eligibility continuously. Also, with the new
deadlines for Schedule 13D, no need would exist to amend the other filing deadlines applicable
to (former) Schedule 13G filers. However, this alternative would further accelerate the filing for
former Schedule 13G filers, and exacerbate the concerns about free-riding and front-running
risks these filers could face as discussed above, potentially reducing their profits and increasing
their costs.
4. Section 16 Rule Amendment
We considered amending Rule 16a-1(a)(1) to avoid the application of proposed Rule 13d3(e) to the determination as to whether a person is a 10% holder under Section 16. More
specifically, under this alternative, a holder of the cash-settled derivative securities covered by
proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would be deemed the beneficial owner for purposes of Sections 13(d)
and (g), but not the beneficial owner of those reference securities for purposes of determining
whether that person is a 10% percent holder under Section 16. This alternative could reduce the
154
costs of proposed Rule 13d-3(e) and its impact on Section 16 reporting obligations. However,
the alternative approach could also potentially create two standards for determining beneficial
ownership, potentially leading to confusion in the market and concerns regarding whether the
rule is applied differentially to different groups of filers. Also, investors and the market would
receive less informative Section 16 disclosures under the alternative as compared to the proposed
approach, and the disclosures would thus be less beneficial.
5. Modify Scope of Structured Data Requirement
We also considered modifying the scope of the proposed structured data requirement for
Schedules 13D and 13G. For example, we considered narrowing the requirement to include only
the quantitative disclosures reported on Schedules 13D and 13G. Narrowing the scope of the
structuring requirement to include only the quantitative disclosures could provide a clearer focus
on those data points that could potentially be used most widely for market-level aggregation,
comparison and analysis. However, the non-quantitative disclosures on Schedules 13D and 13G,
such as textual narratives and identification checkboxes, also would be valuable for data users to
access and analyze in an efficient and automated manner. In addition, the incremental cost
savings to filers of requiring only quantitative disclosures to be structured would be low given
the availability of a fillable web form in which filers would be able to input both quantitative and
non-quantitative Schedule 13D and 13G disclosures.
F. Request for Comment
We request comment on all aspects of our economic analysis, including the potential
costs and benefits of the proposed amendments and alternatives thereto, and whether the
proposed amendments, if adopted, would promote efficiency, competition and capital formation
or have an impact on investor protection. In addition, we also seek comment on alternative
approaches to the proposed amendments and the associated costs and benefits of these
approaches. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data, estimation methodologies, and
155
other factual support for their views, in particular, on costs and benefits estimates. Specifically,
we seek comment with respect to the following questions:
92. Would the proposed amendments shortening Schedule 13D filing deadlines negatively
affect shareholder activism? If yes, are there any other reasons for such effects besides the
ones we have discussed? Would such effects be more or less significant than our
assessment? Would the benefits justify the costs? Are you aware of any data or
methodology that could help us quantify the effects? Are there any factors that could
mitigate these effects besides the ones we discussed? Is it fair to presume that
blockholders generally have the ability to adapt to a five-day filing deadline given the fact
that a number of them are already filing on this deadline voluntarily?
93. Studies observe share accumulations well above 10% of an issuer in the 95th percentile of
the data set. Is it fair to presume that those accumulations are for purposes other than
shareholder activism? If so, what are those purposes? What are the outcomes of such
accumulations? If not, and such high accumulations were made for the purposes of
activism, what motivates abnormally high accumulation at the time of 13D filings?
94. Would the proposed amendments shortening Schedule 13G filing deadlines increase the
risk of free-riding or front-running for Schedule 13G filers? Would such effects be more
or less significant than our assessment? Are there any other costs associated with these
proposed amendments besides the ones we have identified? Would the benefits justify the
costs? Are you aware of any data or methodology that could quantify the costs?
95. Would the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-3 regarding cash-settled derivative
securities negatively affect the use of derivative instruments? Would such effect be more
or less significant than our assessment? Are there any other economic effects associated
with these proposed amendments that we have not discussed? Would the benefits justify
the costs? Are you aware of any data or methodology that could help quantify the costs?
156
To what extent do holders of derivative securities have the ability to influence or direct the
voting, acquisition or disposition of shares acquired by the counterparty to hedge its
position? Is it common for the holder to acquire the hedge securities from the
counterparty and/or the counterparty to settle its positions with shares (rather than cash)?
Please provide any data to support your view.
96. Would the proposed amendments affirming our view on group formation have negative
effects on shareholder activism, engagement and communication? Would such effects be
more or less significant than our assessment? Are there any other economic effects
associated with these proposed amendments that we have not discussed? Would the
benefits justify the costs? Are you aware of any data or methodology that could help
quantify the costs?
97. Would the proposed amendments requiring submission of all disclosures (other than
exhibits) on Schedules 13D and 13G in a structured, machine-readable data language
(specifically 13D/G-specific XML) increase the accessibility and usability of those
disclosures by investors and markets? Would this effect consequently improve
transparency and reduce any existing information asymmetries related to beneficial
ownership reporting on Schedules 13D and 13G? What are the incremental compliance
costs associated with the structuring requirements? Would those costs be mitigated by the
availability of an online web form that would render manually inputted disclosures into
13D/G-specific XML, as discussed? How, if at all, would the nature and magnitude of
benefits and costs change if the scope of the proposed structuring requirement were
modified (for example, by requiring structuring of only quantitative disclosures)? Are
there any other economic effects associated with these proposed amendments that we have
not discussed? Would the benefits justify the costs? Are you aware of any data or
methodology that can help quantify the costs?
157
98. Are there any other costs and benefits to market participants that are not identified or are
misidentified in the above analysis?
99. Would the proposed amendments affect efficiency, competition and capital formation as
we have discussed? Would such effects be more or less significant than our assessment?
Are there any other effects on efficiency, competition and capital formation that are not
identified or are misidentified in the above analysis? Are you aware of any data or
methodology that can help quantify these effects?
100.Are there any other costs and benefits associated with alternative approaches that are not
identified or misidentified in the above analysis? Should we consider any of the
alternative approaches outlined above instead of the proposed amendments? Which
approach and why?
101.Are there any other alternative approaches to improve Section 13(d) and (g) disclosure
that we should consider? If so, what are they and what would be the associated costs or
benefits of these alternative approaches?
IV. Paperwork Reduction Act
A. Summary of the Collections of Information
Certain provisions of our rules, schedules and forms that would be affected by the
proposed amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).268 We are submitting the proposed amendments
to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA.269
The hours and costs associated with maintaining, disclosing or providing the information
required by the proposed amendments constitute paperwork burdens imposed by such collection

268 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
269 44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 CFR 1320.11.
158
of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond
to, a collection of information requirement unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number.
The titles for the affected collections of information are:
• “Regulation 13D and Regulation 13G; Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G” (OMB Control
No. 3235-0145);
• “Form 3 - Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities” (OMB Control No.
235-0104);
• “Form 4 - Statement of Changes In Beneficial Ownership” (OMB Control No. 3235-
0287); and
• “Form 5 - Annual Statement of Beneficial Ownership” (OMB Control No. 3235-0362).
These schedules and forms contain item requirements that outline the information a reporting
person must disclose. Compliance with the information collections is mandatory. Responses to
the information collections are not kept confidential and there is no mandatory retention period
for the information disclosed.
B. Incremental and Aggregate Burden and Cost Estimates for the Proposed
Amendments to Rules 13d-2, 13d-3, 13d-5, and 13d-101
Below we estimate the incremental and aggregate effect on paperwork burden as a result
of certain of our proposed amendments. To fully analyze the impact of our proposed
amendments, our estimates generally constitute the upper limit of the amount of paperwork
burden that potentially could be incurred by the parties affected by our proposed amendments,
specifically with respect to our proposed amendments to Rules 13d-2, 13d-3, 13d-5, and 13d101. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens would likely vary among
159
individual respondents based on a number of factors, including the nature and conduct of their
business.
We believe that the proposed amendments potentially could increase the number of
responses to the existing collection of information for Schedules 13D and 13G as well as Forms
3, 4 and 5. For example, the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-2(b) with respect to the standard
that requires an amendment to Schedule 13G could potentially increase the filing frequency for
Schedule 13G amendments.270 Similarly, our proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5
potentially could result in additional persons becoming subject to Regulation 13D-G and Section
16 which would result in those persons being required to make initial and amended Schedule
13D and Schedule 13G filings and Form 3, 4, and 5 filings. 271
For purposes of this PRA, we estimate that there could be an additional 36,702 annual
responses to the collection of information under Regulation 13D-G272 as a result of the proposed
amendments, 36,190 of which would be attributable to our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-

270 See supra Section III.C.1.b.ii. For example, Rule 13d-2(b) currently requires that a Schedule 13G be amended 45
days after the calendar year-end in which any change occurred to the information previously reported. Under our
proposed amendment to Rule 13d-2(b), a Schedule 13G would have to be amended five business days after the end
of the month in which a material change occurred to the information previously reported. Although an amendment
under Rule 13d-2(b) currently is required for “any” change in the information previously reported, that rule only
requires that one amendment be filed annually, if at all. Under the proposed revisions to that rule, although the
standard for determining an amendment obligation would only arise upon a “material” change to the information
previously reported, the rule changes could theoretically result in numerous amendments being filed on an annual
basis, with as many as 12 Schedule 13G amendments being filed annually pursuant to Rule 13d-2(b).
271 See supra Sections III.C.2.b and 3.b. For example, a holder of cash-settled derivative securities may be deemed
the beneficial owner of more than 5% of a covered class or a 10% holder as a result of the application of proposed
Rule 13d-3(e). In addition, two or more persons may be deemed to have formed a group that beneficially owns
more than 5% of a covered class or a 10% holder as a result of the application of our proposed amendments to Rule
13d-5, particularly with respect to the tipper-tippee relationships that are the subject of proposed Rule 13d5(b)(1)(ii). The group, therefore, may have to comply with Section 13(d) and Section 16.
272 To the extent that a person or entity incurs a burden imposed by Regulation 13D-G, it is encompassed within the
collection of information estimates for Regulation 13D-G. This burden includes the preparation, filing, processing
and circulation of initial and amended Schedules 13D and 13G.
160
2,273 83 of which would be attributable to our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3,274 and 429 of
which would be attributable to our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5.
275 We also estimate that

273 The current OMB inventory for Regulation 13D-G reflects 8,587 annual responses. As discussed in Section
III.B.2 supra, a total of 54,601 total Schedule 13D and 13G filings were made during calendar year 2020. See supra
notes 201-202 and accompanying text. Of those filings, 31,221, or 57.18%, were Schedule 13G amendments. Id.
Upon further review of that data set, we note that 25,642, or 82.13%, of those filings were made within the first 45
days of calendar year 2020. For purposes of this PRA estimate, therefore, we assume that 57.18% of the 8,587
annual responses in the current OMB inventory for Regulation 13D-G, or 4,910 responses, are Schedule 13G
amendments. Of those 4,910 responses, we assume that 67%, or 3,290 responses, were made pursuant to Rule 13d2(b). Our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-2(b) could result in 12 Schedule 13G amendments being filed annually
pursuant to Rule 13d-2(b), as compared to the one annual amendment currently required by Rule 13d-2(b). See
supra note 270. As such, for purposes of this PRA, we estimate that there would be 39,480 Schedule 13G
amendments filed annually pursuant to Rule 13d-2(b) as a result of our proposed amendments (calculated by
multiplying (x) the 3,290 annual responses currently attributable to Rule 13d-2(b) by (y) 12), resulting in 36,190
additional responses to the collection of information under Regulation 13D-G (calculated as the difference between
(x) the 39,480 annual responses estimated to be attributable to Rule 13d-2(b) as a result of the proposed amendments
and (y) the 3,290 annual responses currently attributable to Rule 13d-2(b)). We note, however, that this estimate
likely reflects the upper limit of the potential increases in the number of annual Regulation 13D-G responses as a
result of our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-2(b) because (1) the proposed amendments would revise Rule 13d2(b) to require a Schedule 13G be amended only for a “material” change to the information previously reported, as
compared to the current requirement that an amendment be filed for “any” change to the information previously
reported and (2) the information previously reported by many Schedule 13G filers may not change materially on a
monthly basis.
274 For purposes of this PRA estimate, we assume that the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3 potentially would
lead to an increase in the number of Schedule 13D filings. We do not expect that the number of Schedule 13G
filings would increase given that proposed Rule 13d-3(e)(1)(i)(C) would deem a person to be a beneficial owner
only if such person held the derivative securities with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of
the issuer of the relevant covered class, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such
purpose or effect. Consequently, Exempt Investors are the only type of Schedule 13G filer that could be deemed
beneficial owners of a cash-settled derivative security’s reference covered class under proposed Rule 13d-3(e) and
continue to report beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G. We believe, however, that certain persons filing a
Schedule 13G as an Exempt Investor, such as founders of companies and early investors in an issuer’s class of
equity securities who made their acquisition before the class was registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
already control or may be in a position to control the issuer, and generally would not have a need to acquire or hold
cash-settled derivative securities to effectuate influence or control over an issuer. Exempt Investors also may seek
to avoid acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 2% of a covered class as a result of application of proposed
Rule 13d-3(e) given that such an acquisition could not only jeopardize their eligibility to rely upon the Section
13(d)(6)(B) exemption, but also reduce or eliminate their capacity to acquire any shares with voting rights during the
twelve month period in which the availability of the exemption is measured. As discussed in Section III.B.2 supra,
there were a total of 10,542 Schedule 13D filings made in calendar year 2020. See supra notes 201-202 and
accompanying text. Those 10,542 filings comprised 19.3% of the total number of Schedule 13D and 13G filings
(54,601) made in calendar year 2020. Id. Applying that percentage to the current OMB inventory for Regulation
13D-G, we assume that 1,657 (or 19.3%) of the 8,587 annual responses are Schedule 13D filings. As noted in
Section III.C.2.b supra, we lack data on the current use of cash-settled derivative securities. Based on the number of
Schedule 13D filings that were made in 2020, however, we assume that the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3
could result in a 5% increase in the number of Schedule 13D filers. As such, we estimate that there would be 83
additional responses to the collection of information under Regulation 13D-G as a result of our proposed
amendment to Rule 13d-3 (calculated by multiplying (x) the 1,657 estimated number of Schedule 13D filings in the
OMB inventory by (y) 5%). We note, however, that our analysis may overestimate the potential increase in the
number of annual Regulation 13D-G responses as a result of our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3. For example,
161
there would be an additional 2,197 Forms 3 filed, an additional 33,821 Forms 4 filed, and an
additional 594 Forms 5 filed as a result of the proposed amendments.276
In addition to a potential increase in the number of annual responses, we expect that the
proposed amendments would change the estimated burden per response for Regulation 13D-G.277
For both Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G filers, we expect that the proposed structured data

it is possible that those derivative holders that may beneficially own more than 5% of a covered class as a result of
proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would have eventually acquired beneficial ownership of more than 5% of such covered
class in the same calendar year even absent application of proposed Rule 13d-3(e). In such cases, although
application of proposed Rule 13d-3(e) would accelerate the point in time at which such person’s initial Schedule
13D filing obligation arose, it would not necessarily cause additional persons to become Schedule 13D filers. In
addition, it is possible that persons who use such derivatives may take steps to avoid becoming beneficial owners—
or minimize or entirely eliminate the use of such derivatives—in order to avoid a Schedule 13D filing obligation if
proposed Rule 13d-3(e) were adopted.
275 As discussed in Section III.C.3.b supra, because we lack data on how many groups may not be reporting
beneficial ownership because of the misimpression that an agreement is required, we cannot provide reliable
estimates on how such reporting practices would change. For purposes of this PRA estimate, however, we assume
that our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5 could result in a 5% increase in the number Schedule 13D and 13G
filers. As such, based on the current OMB inventory for Regulation 13D-G, which reflects 8,587 annual responses,
we estimate that the number of responses will be increased by 429 filings (calculated by multiplying (x) the current
8,587 annual responses by (y) 5%). We note, however, that our analysis may overestimate the potential increase in
the number of annual Regulation 13D-G responses as a result of the adoption of our proposed amendments to Rule
13d-5 because such adoption may incentivize persons to take steps to avoid triggering a requirement to report
beneficial ownership. For example, two or more persons who collectively beneficially own in excess of 5% of a
covered class may avoid coordination that could result in them being found to have “act[ed] as” a group for the
purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of a covered class absent reliance on an exemption. In addition, our
proposed amendments to Rule 13d-6 would create new exemptions under which two or more persons will not be
deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of, or otherwise beneficially own, an issuer’s equity securities as a
group. As such, to the extent beneficial owners qualify for and rely on the proposed exemptions in Rule 13d-6,
those exemptions may offset any potential increase in the number of annual Regulation 13D-G responses as a result
of the adoption of our proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5.
276 The current OMB inventories for Forms 3, 4 and 5 reflect 21,968, 338,207 and 5,939 annual responses,
respectively. As discussed above, our proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 could increase the number of
persons required to make Form 3, 4 and 5 filings. See supra note 271 and accompanying text. For purposes of this
PRA estimate, we assume that any increase in the number of Form 3, 4 and 5 filings will correspond with our
estimated increase in the number of Schedule 13D filings as a result of our proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3,
which is 5%, and the increase in the number of Schedule 13D and 13G filings as a result of our proposed
amendment to Rule 13d-5, which is also 5%. See supra notes 274 and 275. Taking the sum of these percentages
(10%) and applying that sum percentage to the current OMB inventories for Forms 3, 4 and 5, we estimate that the
number of responses will be increased by 2,197, 33,821 and 594 for Forms 3, 4 and 5, respectively. But see supra
notes 274 and 275 for a discussion of why this analysis may overestimate the potential increase in the number of
annual Form 3, 4 and 5 responses as a result of our proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5.
277 We do not expect that the proposed amendments would change the estimated burden per response for Form 3, 4,
or 5 because the proposed amendments would not alter the filing deadlines for those forms or the type or form of the
information required to be disclosed.
162
requirements would increase the estimated burden per response by requiring that the disclosures
in those schedules be made using the 13D/G-specific XML. For Schedule 13D filers, we expect
that the amendment to Rule 13d-3 would increase the estimated burden per response if such
filers hold cash-settled derivative securities as a result of the calculations required by proposed
Rule 13d-3(e) to determine the number of reference securities that such filers would be deemed
to beneficially own pursuant to that proposed rule. 278 Finally, for Schedule 13D, we expect that
the amendments to Item 6 of Schedule 13D potentially could increase the estimated burden per
response by specifying that disclosure is required under Item 6 for the use of cash-settled
derivative securities with respect to an issuer’s securities. 279
The burden estimates were calculated by estimating the number of parties we anticipate
would expend time, effort and/or financial resources to generate, maintain, retain, disclose or
provide information in connection with the proposed amendments and then multiplying by the
estimated amount of time, on average, such parties would devote in response to the proposed
amendments. The following table summarizes the calculations and assumptions used to derive
our estimates of the aggregate increase in burden corresponding to the proposed amendments.
PRA Table 1. Calculation of Increase in Burden Hours Resulting from the Proposed
Amendments

278 Although applicable to both current and potential Schedule 13D and 13G filers, we assume that the proposed
amendment to Rule 13d-3, if adopted, would affect only the burden hours for Schedule 13D filers, and not for
Schedule 13G filers. See supra note 274 for a discussion of why we do not believe that the proposed amendment to
Rule 13d-3 would impact Schedule 13G filers.
279 We further expect, however, that this potential increase may be offset by the proposed amendment to Item 6 that
would delete the “including but not limited to” proviso.

a As discussed in Section III.B.2 supra, there were 54,601 total Schedule 13D and 13G filings during calendar
year 2020, comprised of 10,542 Schedule 13D filings and 44,059 Schedule 13G filings. See supra notes 201-202
and accompanying text. We note, therefore, that 19.3% of the filings were Schedule 13D filings and 80.7% of the
filings were Schedule 13G filings. Applying those percentages to the current OMB inventory for Regulation 13DG, we assume that 1,657 (or 19.3%) of the 8,587 annual responses are Schedule 13D filings and that the remaining
6,930 (or 80.7%) are Schedule 13G filings. When taking into account the potential effects of the proposed
amendments, if adopted, we estimate that (1) the number of Schedule 13D filings could increase by 10% (166
additional filings) as a result of the proposed amendments to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 and (2) the number of Schedule
13G filings could increase by 5% (346 additional filings) as a result of the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5 and
36,190 as a result of the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-2. See supra notes 273-275.
b The current OMB inventory reflects a total of 27,412 annual burden hours for Regulation 13D-G. When
applied to the current OMB inventory of 8,587 annual responses, this results in an average of 3.19 burden hours per
Schedule 13D or 13G filing. We use these per filing burden hours as a baseline for estimating the burden impact of
the proposed amendments. For the proposed structured data requirements, we estimate they would increase the
burden per response for both Schedule 13D and 13G filers by 0.5 burden hours. Our assumption is that the burden
would be greatest in the first year after adoption, as filers adjust to the new requirement and update their Schedule
13D and 13G preparation and filing processes accordingly. We estimate that the burden of the proposed structured
data requirement would be 1 hour in the first year and 0.25 hours in each of the following two years for a three-year
average of 0.5 burden hours. For the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3, we estimate they would increase the
burden per respondent by 0.5 hours. Our assumption is that the burden would be the greatest in the first year after
adoption, as filers adjust to the new requirements and develop systems and processes to determine the amount of
their beneficial ownership as a result of their holdings of cash-settled derivative securities. We estimate that the
burden of the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3 would be 1 hour in the first year and 0.25 hours in each of the
following two years for a three-year average of 0.5 burden hours. Although we expect that the burden of complying
with the requirements of proposed Rule 13d-3(e) (including, in particular, the requirements in the notes to proposed
Rule 13d-3(e)(2) that the relevant calculations be performed on a daily basis) would be greater than the burden of
complying with the structured data requirements, we also expect that a relatively small percentage of all Schedule
13D filers hold cash-settled derivative securities and, therefore, Rule 13d-3(e) would only apply to a subset of
Schedule 13D filers (whereas the structured data requirements would apply to all Schedule 13D and 13G filers). As
such, we believe that it is appropriate to adjust the burden per respondent accordingly. Finally, for the proposed
amendments to Item 6 of Schedule 13D, we estimate they would increase the burden per respondent by 0.1 hours.
Although these proposed amendments could, in some cases, substantially increase the amount of disclosure made
pursuant to Item 6, we believe that this estimate accurately reflects that only a relatively small percentage of all
Schedule 13D filers hold cash-settled derivative securities and, therefore, would be required to make additional
disclosures. In addition, we also expect that any increased burden may be somewhat offset by the proposed
amendment to Item 6 that would delete the “including but not limited to” proviso. Taken together, we estimate that

the proposed amendments could increase the annual burden hours per Schedule 13D filing by 1.1 hours and increase
the annual burden hours per Schedule 13G filing by 0.5 hours. When added to the current average of 3.19 burden
hours per Schedule 13D or 13G filing, we estimate that if the proposed amendments were adopted, the average
burden hours per Schedule 13D filing would be 4.29 hours and the average burden hours per Schedule 13G filing
would be 3.69 hours.

The table below illustrates the incremental change to the total annual compliance burden
in hours and in costs280 as a result of the proposed amendments. The table sets forth the
percentage estimates we typically use for the burden allocation for each response.

† This number reflects an estimated increase of 36,702 annual responses to the existing Regulation 13D-G

Finally, the table that follows summarizes the requested paperwork burden for Regulation
13D-G that will be submitted to OMB for review in accordance with the PRA, including the
estimated total reporting burdens and costs, under the proposed amendments.

280 Our estimates assume that 75% of the burden is borne by the reporting persons and 25% is borne by outside
professionals at $400 per hour. We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending
on the nature of the professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would
be an average of $400 per hour.

In addition, the requested increase in the paperwork burden for Forms 3, 4, and 5 that will
be submitted to OMB for review in accordance with the PRA will be 1,099 hours, 16,911 hours
and 594 hours, respectively, and zero dollars for each Form. 281
Given the number of variables that are highly specific to the unique circumstances of
each type of person affected by the proposed amendments, our ability to predict the magnitude of
corresponding costs and burdens with any precision is limited. Therefore, we encourage public
commenters to consider our assessment and provide additional information and, where available,
data that would be helpful in deriving our estimates for purposes of the PRA.
Request for Comment
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), we request comment in order to:

281 These amounts are calculated based on the estimated number of additional Forms 3, 4, and 5 filed as a result of
the proposed amendments—2,197, 33,821 and 594, respectively, see supra note 276 and accompanying text—
multiplied by the current OMB inventory number of hours per response. The current OMB inventory indicates that
there are 0.5 burden hours associated with each Form 3 and Form 4 filing and one burden hour associated with each
Form 5 filing. The current OMB inventory also indicates that there are $0 of burden dollars associated with each
Form 3, 4, and 5 filing.

• Evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper
performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information
would have practical utility;
• Evaluate the accuracy and assumptions and estimates of the burden of the proposed
collection of information;
• Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected;
• Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information
on those who respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology; and
• Evaluate whether the proposed amendments would have any effects on any other
collection of information not previously identified in this section.
Any member of the public may direct to us any comments concerning the accuracy of these
burden estimates and any suggestions for reducing the burdens. Persons who desire to submit
comments on the collection of information requirements should direct their comments to the
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and send a
copy of the comments to Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, with reference to File No. S7-06-22.
Requests for materials submitted to the OMB by us with regard to these collections of
information should be in writing, refer to File No. S7-06-22 and be submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington DC 20549.
Because the OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collections of information
167
between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to the OMB is best assured of having its
full effect if the OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
V. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”),282 the Commission must advise OMB as to whether the proposed amendments
constitute a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it
results, or is likely to result, in:
• An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an
increase or a decrease);
• A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or
• Significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.
We request comment on whether the proposed amendments would be a “major rule” for
purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on: (a) the potential effect on the
U.S. economy on an annual basis; (b) any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or
individual industries; and (c) any potential effect on competition, investment or innovation.
Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for their views to
the extent possible.
VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The RFA requires Federal agencies, in promulgating rules, to consider the impact of
those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act,283 as amended

282 Pub. L. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996); 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.
283 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
168
by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of
all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to determine the impact of such rulemaking on
“small entities.”284 Section 605(b) of the RFA states that this requirement shall not apply to any
proposed rule or proposed rule amendment which, if adopted, would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 285
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total
assets of $5 million or less;286 or (2) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d) (“Rule 17a5(d)”),
287 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth
plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of the preceding
fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any
person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. 288 An

284 Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits agencies to formulate
their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small entity” for the purposes of
Commission rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking,
are set forth in 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Final Definitions of “Small Business” and “Small Organization” for Purposes
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Release No. 34-18452 (Jan. 28, 1982) [47 FR 5215 (Feb. 4, 1982)].
285 See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
286 See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).
287 Rule 17a-5(d).
288 See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).
169
investment company, including a business development company, 289 is considered to be a “small
business” if it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment
companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year.290
Although the proposed amendments would apply to beneficial owners regardless of their
size, we believe that the vast majority of the beneficial owners that would be subject to the
proposed amendments would not be small entities for purposes of the RFA. For example, the
proposed amendments to the filing deadlines in Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2, as well as the proposed
amendments to Rules 13 and 201 of Regulation S-T and the proposed structured data
requirements, only would impact persons who beneficially own more than 5% of a covered class.
In addition, the proposed amendment to Rule 13d-3 would apply to holders of cash-settled
derivative securities; we believe that persons who hold such derivatives are generally larger,
sophisticated investors. Similarly, while the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5 could apply to
numerous smaller persons who individually, absent formation of a group pursuant to the
proposed amendments, would not beneficially own more than 5% of a covered class, we believe
that persons who take concerted actions that would implicate the proposed amendments
generally would be larger, sophisticated investors. That same belief applies to the exemptions
contained in the proposed amendments to Rule 13d-6.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the
proposed amendments, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities for purposes of the RFA. We invite commenters to address whether the
proposed amendments would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of

289 Business development companies are a category of closed-end investment company that are not registered under
the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48) and 80a-53-64].
290 17 CFR 270.0-10(a).
170
small entities, and, if so, what would be the nature of any impact on small entities. We request
that commenters provide empirical data to illustrate the extent of the impact. Such comments
will be considered in the preparation of any final rules (and in a Final Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis if one is needed) and will be placed in the same public file as comments on the
proposed amendments themselves.

5. Amend § 240.13d-1 by revising paragraphs (a), (b)(2), (c) introductory text, (d),
(e)(1) introductory text, (f)(1), (g), and (i) to read as follows:
§240.13d-1 Filing of Schedules 13D and 13G.
(a) Any person who, upon acquiring directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any
equity security of a class which is specified in paragraph (i) of this section, is directly or
indirectly the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class shall, within five days after
the date of the acquisition, file with the Commission, a statement containing the information
required by Schedule 13D (§240.13d-101).
(b) * * *
(2) The Schedule 13G filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be filed
within five business days after the end of the month in which the person became obligated under
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to report the person's beneficial ownership as of the last day of
the month, provided, that it shall not be necessary to file a Schedule 13G unless the percentage of
the class of equity security specified in paragraph (i) of this section beneficially owned as of the
end of the month is more than five percent.
(c) A person who would otherwise be obligated under paragraph (a) of this section to file
a statement on Schedule 13D (§240.13d-101) may, in lieu thereof, file with the Commission,
within five days after the date of an acquisition described in paragraph (a) of this section, a shortform statement on Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102). Provided, that the person:
* * * * *
(d) Any person who, as of the end of any month, is or becomes directly or indirectly the
beneficial owner of more than five percent of any equity security of a class specified in
paragraph (i) of this section and who is not required to file a statement under paragraph (a) of
this section by virtue of the exemption provided by Section 13(d)(6)(A) or (B) of the Act (15
U.S.C. 78m(d)(6)(A) or 78m(d)(6)(B)), or because the beneficial ownership was acquired prior
173
to December 22, 1970, or because the person otherwise (except for the exemption provided by
Section 13(d)(6)(C) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(6)(C))) is not required to file a statement, shall
file with the Commission, within five business days after the end of the month in which the
person became obligated to report under this paragraph (d), a statement containing the
information required by Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102).
(e)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and §240.13d-2(b), a person
that has reported that it is the beneficial owner of more than five percent of a class of equity
securities in a statement on Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this
section, or is required to report the acquisition but has not yet filed the schedule, shall
immediately become subject to paragraph (a) of this section and §240.13d-2(a) and shall file a
statement on Schedule 13D (§240.13d-101) within five days if, and shall remain subject to those
requirements for so long as, the person:
* * * * *
(f)(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section and §240.13d-2(b), persons reporting
on Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall immediately
become subject to paragraph (a) of this section and §240.13d-2(a) and shall remain subject to
those requirements for so long as, and shall file a statement on Schedule 13D (§240.13d-101)

percent of the class of equity securities.
* * * * *
(g) Any person who has reported an acquisition of securities in a statement on Schedule
13G (§240.13d-102) pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or has become obligated to report
on the Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) but has not yet filed the Schedule, and thereafter ceases to
be a person specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section or determines that it no longer has
acquired or holds the securities in the ordinary course of business shall immediately become
174
subject to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section (if the person satisfies the requirements specified in
paragraph (c)) and §240.13d-2 (a), (b), or (d), and shall file, within five days thereafter, a
statement on Schedule 13D (§240.13d-101) or amendment to Schedule 13G, as applicable, if the
person is a beneficial owner at that time of more than five percent of the class of equity
securities.
* * * * *
(i)(1) For the purpose of this section, the term “equity security” means any equity
security of a class which is registered pursuant to section 12 of that Act, or any equity security of
any insurance company which would have been required to be so registered except for the
exemption contained in section 12(g)(2)(G) of the Act, or any equity security issued by a closedend investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; provided, such
term shall not include securities of a class of non-voting securities.
(2) For the purpose of this section, the term “business day” means any day, other than
Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., eastern time.
* * * * *
6. Amend § 240.13d-2 by:
a. Revising paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d); and
b. Removing the parenthetical authority citation at the end of the section.
The revisions read as follows:
§240.13d-2 Filing of amendments to Schedules 13D or 13G.
(a) If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the Schedule 13D (§240.13d101) required by §240.13d-1(a), including, but not limited to, any material increase or decrease
in the percentage of the class beneficially owned, the person or persons who were required to file
the statement shall file or cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment disclosing that
change within one business day after that change. An acquisition or disposition of beneficial
175
ownership of securities in an amount equal to one percent or more of the class of securities shall
be deemed “material” for purposes of this section; acquisitions or dispositions of less than those
amounts may be material, depending upon the facts and circumstances.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, and provided that the person filing a
Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) pursuant to §240.13d-1(b) or (c) continues to meet the
requirements set forth therein, any person who has filed a Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102)
pursuant to §240.13d-1(b), (c), or (d) shall amend the statement within five business days after
the end of each month if, as of the end of the month, there are any material changes in the
information reported in the previous filing on that Schedule, including, but not limited to, any
material increase or decrease in the percentage of the class beneficially owned; provided,
however, that an amendment need not be filed with respect to a change in the percent of class
outstanding previously reported if the change results solely from a change in the aggregate
number of securities outstanding. Once an amendment has been filed reflecting beneficial
ownership of five percent or less of the class of securities, no additional filings are required
unless the person thereafter becomes the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class
and is required to file pursuant to §240.13d-1.
(c) Any person relying on §240.13d-1(b) that has filed its initial Schedule 13G
(§240.13d-102) pursuant to §240.13d-1(b) shall, in addition to filing any amendments pursuant
to §240.13d-2(b), file an amendment on Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) within five days after the
date on which the person’s direct or indirect beneficial ownership exceeds 10 percent of the class
of equity securities. Thereafter, that person shall, in addition to filing any amendments pursuant
to §240.13d-2(b), file an amendment on Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) within five days after the
date on which the person’s direct or indirect beneficial ownership increases or decreases by more
than five percent of the class of equity securities. Once an amendment has been filed reflecting
176
beneficial ownership of five percent or less of the class of securities, no additional filings are
required by this paragraph (c).
(d) Any person relying on §240.13d-1(c) that has filed its initial Schedule 13G
(§240.13d-102) pursuant to §240.13d-1(c) shall, in addition to filing any amendments pursuant
to paragraph (b) of this section, file an amendment on Schedule 13G (§240.13d-102) within one
business day after acquiring, directly or indirectly, greater than 10 percent of a class of equity
securities specified in §240.13d-1(d), and thereafter within one business day after increasing or
decreasing its beneficial ownership by more than five percent of the class of equity securities.
Once an amendment has been filed reflecting beneficial ownership of five percent or less of the
class of securities, no additional filings are required by this paragraph (d).
* * * * *
7. Amend § 240.13d-3 by:
a. Revising paragraph (d) introductory text;
b. Adding paragraph (e); and
c. Removing the parenthetical authority citation at the end of the section.
The revision and addition read as follows:
§240.13d-3 Determination of beneficial owner.
* * * * *
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (c), and (e) of this section:
* * * * *
(e)(1)(i) A person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of a number of securities
for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Act, calculated in accordance with paragraph
(e)(2) of this section, in a class of equity securities if that person holds a derivative security, as
defined in §240.16a-1(c) (Rule 16a-1(c)), other than a security-based swap as defined by section
3(a)(68) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68)) and the rules and regulations thereunder in this part:
177
(A) That references such class of equity securities;
(B) To the extent that such derivative security is required to be settled exclusively in cash
and holding such security has not otherwise resulted in a determination that the person is a
beneficial owner under this section; and
(C) That is held with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the
issuer of such class of equity securities, or in connection with or as a participant in any
transaction having such purpose or effect.
(ii) Any securities not outstanding which are referenced by such derivative security shall
be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of outstanding
securities of the class owned by such person but shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the
purpose of computing the percentage of the class by any other person.
(2)(i) The number of securities that a person shall be deemed to beneficially own
pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be the larger of (in each case as applicable):
(A) The product that is obtained by multiplying {x} the number of securities by reference
to which the amount payable under the derivative security is determined by {y} the delta of the
derivative security; and
(B) The number that is obtained by {x} dividing the notional amount of the derivative
security by the most recent closing market price of the reference equity security, and then {y}
multiplying such quotient by the delta of the derivative security.
(ii) For the purpose of this section, the term “delta” means, with respect to a derivative
security, the ratio that that is obtained by comparing {x} the change in the value of the derivative
security to {y} the change in the value of the reference equity security.
NOTE 1 TO PARAGRAPH (e)(2). For purposes of determining the number of equity
securities that a person shall be deemed to beneficially own pursuant to this paragraph (e), only
178
long positions in derivative securities should be counted. Short positions in derivative securities
should not be netted against long positions or otherwise taken into account.
NOTE 2 TO PARAGRAPH (e)(2). For purposes of determining the number of equity
securities that a person shall be deemed to beneficially own pursuant to this paragraph (e), the
calculation in clause (x) of paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section should be performed on a daily
basis.
NOTE 3 TO PARAGRAPH (e)(2). If a derivative security does not have a fixed delta, then a
person who holds such derivative security should calculate the delta on a daily basis, for
purposes of determining the number of equity securities that such person shall be deemed to
beneficially own pursuant to this paragraph (e), based on the closing market price of the
reference equity security on that day.
8. Revise § 240.13d-5 to read as follows:
§240.13d-5 Acquisition of beneficial ownership.
(a) A person who becomes a beneficial owner of securities shall be deemed to have
acquired such beneficial ownership for purposes of section 13(d)(1) of the Act, whether such
acquisition was through purchase or otherwise. However, executors or administrators of a
decedent’s estate generally will be presumed not to have acquired the beneficial ownership held
by the decedent’s estate until such time as such executors or administrators are qualified under
