Cybersecurity Risk Management for Investment Advisers, Registered Investment
Companies, and Business Development Companies
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing new rules under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and the Investment Company Act of 1940
(“Investment Company Act”) to require registered investment advisers (“advisers”) and
investment companies (“funds”) to adopt and implement written cybersecurity policies and
procedures reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks. The Commission also is
proposing a new rule and form under the Advisers Act to require advisers to report significant
cybersecurity incidents affecting the adviser, or its fund or private fund clients, to the
Commission. With respect to disclosure, the Commission is proposing amendments to various
forms regarding the disclosure related to significant cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity
incidents that affect advisers and funds and their clients and shareholders. Finally, we are
proposing new recordkeeping requirements under the Advisers Act and Investment Company
Act.

Private Fund Advisers; Documentation of Registered Investment Adviser
Compliance Reviews
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or the “SEC”) is
proposing new rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act” or the
“Act”). We propose to require registered investment advisers to private funds to provide
transparency to their investors regarding the full cost of investing in private funds and the
performance of such private funds. We also are proposing rules that would require a registered
private fund adviser to obtain an annual financial statement audit of each private fund it advises
and, in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction, a fairness opinion from an
independent opinion provider. In addition, we are proposing rules that would prohibit all private
fund advisers, including those that are not registered with the Commission, from engaging in
certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes that are contrary to the
public interest and the protection of investors. All private fund advisers would also be prohibited
from providing preferential treatment to certain investors in a private fund, unless the adviser
discloses such treatment to other current and prospective investors. We are proposing
corresponding amendments to the Advisers Act books and records rule to facilitate compliance
with these proposed new rules and assist our examination staff. Finally, we are proposing
2
amendments to the Advisers Act compliance rule, which would affect all registered investment
advisers, to better enable our staff to conduct examinations.

I. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR REFORM
In the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Congress passed and the President signed
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”),
which increased the Commission’s oversight responsibility for private fund advisers.
2 Among
other things, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Advisers Act generally to require advisers to
private funds to register with the Commission and to require the Commission to establish
reporting and recordkeeping requirements for advisers to private funds for investor protection
and systemic risk purposes.
3
 The Dodd-Frank Act also added section 211(h) to the Advisers
Act, which, among other things, directs the Commission to “facilitate the provision of simple and
clear disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their relationships with…investment
advisers” and “promulgate rules prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of
interest, and compensation schemes for investment advisers.”4
Registration and reporting on both Form ADV and Form PF have been critical to
increasing transparency and protecting investors in private funds and assessing systemic risk.
5


2 Section 202(a)(29) of the Advisers Act defines the term “private fund” as an issuer that would be an investment
company, as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3) (“Investment
Company Act”), but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act. We use “private fund” and “fund”
interchangeably throughout this release.
3 See, e.g., Rule Implementing Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Investment Advisers Act
Release No. 3221 (June 22, 2011) (“Implementing Release”); Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private
Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF, Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 3308 (Oct. 31, 2011).

(2010).
5 The Financial Stability Oversight Council uses these and other tools to assess private fund impact on systemic
risk. See also U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Investment Management, Analytics
Office, Private Fund Statistics, available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/private-fundsstatistics.shtml (providing a summary of private fund industry statistics and trends based on data collected
through Form PF and Form ADV). Staff reports, statistics, and other staff documents (including those cited
herein) represent the views of Commission staff and are not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Commission.
The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved the content of these documents and, like all staff
statements, they have no legal force or effect, do not alter or amend applicable law, and create no new or
8
They also have substantially improved our ability to understand private fund advisers’ operations
and relationships with investors as private funds play an increasingly important role in the
financial system and private funds continue growing in size, complexity, and number. There are
currently 5,037 registered private fund advisers with over $18 trillion in private fund assets under
management.6
 In addition, private funds and their advisers play an increasing role in the
economy. For example, hedge funds engage in trillions of dollars in listed equity and futures
transactions each month.
7
 Private equity and other private funds are involved in mergers and
acquisitions, non-bank lending, and restructurings and bankruptcies. Venture capital funds
provide funding to start-ups and early stage companies. Private funds and their advisers also
play an increasingly important role in the lives of everyday Americans saving for retirement or
college tuition. Some of the largest groups of private fund investors include state and municipal
pension plans, college and university endowments, non-profit organizations, and high net worth
individuals.
8 Numerous investors also have indirect exposure to private funds through private
pension plans, endowments, feeder funds established by banks and other financial institutions,
foundations, and certain other retirement plans.

additional obligations for any person. The Commission has expressed no view regarding the analysis, findings,
or conclusions contained therein.

Quarter 2021 (Nov. 1, 2021) (“Form PF Statistics Report”), at 31, available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/private-funds-statistics/private-funds-statistics-2021-q1.pdf (showing
aggregate portfolio turnover for hedge funds managed by large hedge fund advisers (i.e., advisers with at least
$1.5 billion in hedge fund assets under management) as reported on Form PF).

as reported on Form PF). See also, e.g., Public Investors, Private Funds, and State Law, Baylor Law Review,
Professor William Clayton (June 15, 2020) (“Professor Clayton Article”), at 354 (noting that public pension
plans have dramatically increased their investment in private funds).
9
During our decade overseeing most private fund advisers, our staff has examined private
fund advisers to assess both the issues and risks presented by their business models and the
firms’ compliance with their existing legal obligations.9
 The Commission also has pursued
enforcement actions against private fund advisers for practices that have caused private funds to
pay more in fees and expenses than they should have, which negatively affected returns for
private fund investors, or resulted in investors not being informed of relevant conflicts of interest
concerning the private fund adviser and the fund.10 Despite our examination and enforcement
efforts, these activities persist.11
First, we continue to observe that private fund investments are often opaque; advisers
frequently do not provide investors with sufficiently detailed information about private fund
investments. Without sufficiently clear, comparable information, even sophisticated investors

Compliance, Inspections and Examinations (“OCIE”) was renamed the Division of Examinations (“EXAMS”).
10 See, e.g., In re Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4131 (June 29, 2015)
(settled action) (alleging private fund adviser misallocated more than $17 million in so-called “broken deal”
expenses to its flagship private equity fund); In re Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C., et al., Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 4219 (Oct. 7, 2015) (settled action) (alleging private fund advisers failed to inform
investors about benefits that the advisers obtained from accelerated monitoring fees and discounts on legal
fees); In re NB Alternatives Advisers LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5079 (Dec. 17, 2018) (settled
action) (alleging private fund adviser improperly allocated approximately $2 million of compensation-related
expenses to three private equity funds it advised).
11 See, e.g., In the Matter of Diastole Wealth Management, Inc., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5855 (Sept.
10, 2021) (settled action) (alleging private fund adviser failed to disclose to investors that the adviser
periodically made loans to a company owned by the son of the principal of the advisory firm and that the private
fund’s investment in the company could be used to repay the loans made by the adviser); In re Global
Infrastructure Management, LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5930 (Dec. 20, 2021) (settled action)
(alleging private fund adviser failed to properly offset management fees to private equity funds it managed and
made false and misleading statements to investors and potential investors in those funds concerning
management fee offsets); In the Matter of EDG Management Company, LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release
No. 5617 (Oct. 22, 2020) (settled action) (alleging that private equity fund adviser failed to apply the
management fee calculation method specified in the limited partnership agreement by failing to account for
write downs of portfolio securities causing the fund and investors to overpay management fees); In the Matter
of Mitchell J. Friedman, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5338 (Sept. 4, 2019) (settled action) (alleging
that the co-owner of a private fund advisory firm failed to disclose material conflicts of interest to the private
fund it managed and misled two investors by misrepresenting an investment opportunity).

would be unable to protect their interests or make sound investment decisions. For example,
some investors do not have sufficient information regarding private fund or portfolio company
fees and expenses to make informed investment decisions, given those fees and expenses can be
subject to complicated calculation methodologies (that often include the application of offsets,
waivers, and other limits); may have varied labels across private funds; and can affect individual
investors’ returns differently because of alternative fee arrangements set forth in side letter
agreements. In addition, advisers often provide private fund investors with laundry lists of
potential fees and expenses, without giving details on the magnitude and scope of fees and
expenses charged. Beyond management fees, performance-based compensation, and the
expenses charged directly to the funds, some private fund advisers and their related persons
charge a number of fees and expenses to the fund’s portfolio companies. These can include
consulting fees, monitoring fees, servicing fees, transaction fees, director’s fees, and others. At
the time of the initial investment and as fund operations continue, many investors do not have
sufficient information regarding these fee streams that flow to the adviser or its related persons
and reduce the return on their investment.
Investors also often lack sufficient transparency into how private fund performance is
calculated. Advisers frequently present fund performance reflecting different assumptions,
making it difficult to measure and compare data across funds and advisers or compare the fund’s
performance to the investor’s chosen benchmarks, even where the assumptions are disclosed.
For example, one adviser may show fund performance that reflects the use of a subscription line
of credit initially to fund investments and pay expenses rather than investor capital. Another
adviser may present only unlevered performance results that do not reflect the effect of a
subscription line. More standardized requirements for performance metrics would allow private
11
fund investors to make apples to apples comparisons when assessing the returns of similar fund
strategies over different market environments and over time. More standardized requirements
for performance information also would improve investors’ ability to interpret complex
performance reporting, and assess the relationship between the fees paid in connection with an
investment and the return on that investment as they monitor their investment and consider
potential future investments.
Similarly, investors may not have information regarding the preferred terms granted to
certain investors (e.g., seed investors, strategic investors, those with large commitments, and
employees, friends, and family). Advisers frequently grant preferred terms to certain investors
that often are not attainable for smaller institutional investors or individual investors. In some
cases, these terms materially disadvantage other investors in the private fund.12
This lack of transparency regarding costs, performance, and preferential terms causes an
information imbalance between advisers and private fund investors, which, in many cases,
prevents private bilateral negotiations from effectively remedying shortcomings in the private
funds market. We believe that this imbalance serves only the adviser’s interest and leaves many
investors without the tools they need to effectively protect their interests, whether through
negotiations or otherwise. Moreover, certain advisers may only provide sufficiently detailed
information following an investor’s admission to the fund when the primary bargaining window

12 See, e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission v. Philip A. Falcone, Harbinger Capital Partners Offshore
Manager, L.L.C. and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations GP, L.L.C., Civil Action No. 12 Civ. 5027
(PAC) (S.D.N.Y.) and Securities and Exchange Commission v. and (sic) Harbinger Capital Partners LLC,
Philip A. Falcone and Peter A. Jenson, Civil Action No. 12 Civ. 5028 (PAC) (S.D.N.Y.), Civil Action No. 12
Civ. 5027 (PAC) (S.D.N.Y.), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 22831A (Oct. 2,
2013) (“Harbinger Capital”) (private fund adviser granted favorable redemption and liquidity terms to certain
large investors in a private fund without disclosing these arrangements to the fund’s board of directors and the
other fund investors). See also 17 CFR 275.206(4)-8 (rule 206(4)-8 under the Advisers Act).
12
has closed, particularly for closed-end funds where investors have no, or very limited, options to
withdraw.
Enhanced information about costs, performance, and preferential treatment, would help
an investor better decide whether to invest or to remain invested in a particular private fund, how
to invest other assets in the investor’s portfolio, and whether to invest in private funds managed
by the adviser or its related persons in the future. More standardized information would improve
comparability among private funds with similar characteristics. This information also would
help a private fund investor better monitor and assess the true cost of its investments, the value of
the services for which the fund is paying, and potential conflicts of interest. For example,
enhanced cost information could allow an investor to identify when the private fund has
incorrectly, or improperly, assessed a fee or expense by the adviser contrary to the adviser’s
fiduciary duty, contractual obligations to the fund, or disclosures by the fund or the adviser.
Ultimately, this information would help investors better understand marketplace dynamics and
potentially improve efficiency for future investments, for example, by expediting the process for
reviewing and negotiating fees and expenses. More competition and transparency also could
lower the costs of capital for portfolio companies raising money and increase returns to
investors, potentially bringing greater efficiencies to this part of the capital markets.
We also have continued to observe instances of advisers acting on conflicts of interest
that are not transparent to investors, provide substantial financial benefits to the adviser, and
potentially have significant negative impacts on the private fund’s returns.
13 These issues are

13 See, e.g., In the Matter of Bluecrest Capital Management Limited, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5642
(Dec. 8, 2020) (settled action) (alleging that hedge fund adviser strategically re-allocated its best performing
personnel (traders) from its flagship hedge fund to its proprietary hedge fund, which followed an overlapping
trading strategy and that hedge fund adviser failed to adequately disclose the existence of its proprietary hedge
fund, the movement of traders, and related conflicts of interest); In the Matter of Monomoy Capital
13
widespread in the private fund context because, in many cases, the adviser can influence or
control the portfolio company and can extract compensation without the knowledge of the fund
or its investors. In addition, private funds typically lack governance mechanisms that would help
check overreaching by private fund advisers. For example, although some private funds may
have limited partner advisory committees (“LPACs”) or boards of directors, these types of
bodies may not have the necessary independence, authority, or accountability to oversee and
consent to these conflicts or other harmful practices. Private funds also do not have
comprehensive mechanisms for private fund investors to exercise effective governance, which is
exacerbated by the fact that private fund advisers often provide certain investors with preferential
terms that can create potential conflicts among the fund’s investors. Moreover, the interests of
one or more private fund investors may not represent the interests of, or may otherwise conflict
with the interests of, other investors in the private fund due to, among other things, business or
personal relationships or other private fund investments. To the extent investors are afforded
governance or similar rights, such as LPAC representation, certain fund agreements permit such
investors to exercise their rights in a manner that places their interests ahead of the private fund
or the investors as a whole. For example, certain fund agreements state that, subject to
applicable law, LPAC members owe no duties to the private fund or to any of the other investors
in the private fund and are not obligated to act in the interests of the private fund or the other
investors as a whole.
As an example of advisers acting on conflicts of interest, certain venture capital fund
advisers use private funds to obtain a controlling or influential interest in a non-publicly traded

Management, L.P., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5485 (Apr. 22, 2020) (settled order) (alleging that
private fund adviser charged the fund’s portfolio company for the services of its in-house operations group
without fulling disclosing this practice).
14
early stage company and then instruct that company to hire the adviser or its related persons to
provide certain services. In these circumstances, the adviser often sets the terms of the
engagement, including the price paid for the services. In cases where the adviser causes the fund
to overpay for services because the services were not negotiated in an arm’s-length process, the
adviser’s practice of hiring its related persons harms investors by diminishing the private fund’s
returns. For example, the adviser sometimes instructs the company to pay certain of the
adviser’s bills, to reimburse the adviser for expenses incurred in managing its investment in the
company, or to add to its payroll adviser employees who manage the investment. In contrast,
outside of the private fund context, an adviser often uses private fund clients to buy shares in a
company and may vote proxies or engage with management and the board, but absent taking
some extraordinary steps, the adviser’s ability to influence or control the company is generally
constrained. In addition, if the company is publicly traded, the adviser’s attempts to seize control
or make a variety of other changes are generally visible to its clients and the public at large.
Although many conflicts of interest can involve problematic sales practices or
compensation schemes, some can be managed. For example, advisers have a conflict of interest
with private funds and investors in those funds when they value the fund’s assets and use that
valuation as the basis for the calculation of the adviser’s fees and fund performance.
14 Similarly,
advisers or their related persons have a conflict of interest with the fund and its investors when
they offer existing fund investors the option to sell or exchange their interests in the private fund
for interests in another vehicle advised by the adviser or any of its related persons (an “adviser-

14 See, e.g., SEC v. Joseph W. Daniel, Litigation Release No. 19427 (Oct. 13, 2005) and In re Joseph W. Daniel,
Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2450 (Nov. 29, 2005) (settled action) (alleging adviser failed to properly
value holdings of its hedge fund client, which inflated the management fees investor paid); In the Matter of
Swapnil Rege, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5303 (July 18, 2019) (settled action) (alleging that an
employee of a private fund adviser mispriced the private fund’s investments, which resulted in the adviser
charging the fund excess management fees).
15
led secondary transaction”). In both of these examples, there are opportunities for advisers,
funds, and investors to benefit, but there is also a potential for significant harm if the adviser’s
conflicts are not appropriately handled, including diminishing the fund’s returns because of
excess fees and expenses paid to the fund’s adviser or its related persons. In these cases,
enhanced protections in the form of an annual private fund audit and a fairness opinion in
connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction would help address the concerns presented
by these conflicts.
Other conflicts of interest are contrary to the public interest and the protection of
investors, and cannot be managed given the lack of governance mechanisms frequent in private
funds as discussed above. For example, we have observed situations where the adviser causes
one fund to bear more than its pro rata share of expenses related to a portfolio investment.15 In
these circumstances, an adviser may unfairly allocate fees and expenses to benefit certain
favored clients at the expense of others, indirectly benefiting the adviser. Through our
examinations, our staff also has encountered instances where advisers seek to limit their
fiduciary duty or otherwise provide that the adviser and its related persons will not be liable to
the private fund or investors for breaching its duties (including fiduciary duties) or liabilities
(that exist at law or in equity).16 We believe an adviser that seeks to limit its liability in such a
manner harms the private fund (and, by extension, the private fund investors) by putting the
adviser’s interests ahead of the interests of its private fund client.

15 See, e.g., In the Matter of Lincolnshire Management, Inc., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3927 (Sept. 27,
2014) (settled action) (alleging private equity adviser to two private funds misallocated expenses between the
funds).
16 See, e.g., EXAMS National Examination Program Risk Alert: Observations from Examinations of Private Fund
Advisers (Jan. 27, 2022) (“EXAMS Private Funds Risk Alert 2022”), available at
https://www.sec.gov/files/private-fund-risk-alert-pt-2.pdf.
16
Accordingly, based on our experience overseeing private fund advisers, as well as private
funds’ impact on our financial system, our economy, and American investors’ savings, there is a
need to enhance the regulation of private fund advisers to protect investors, promote more
efficient capital markets, and encourage capital formation. The Commission believes that many
of the practices it has observed are contrary to the public interest and protection of investors and
that these practices, if left unchecked, would continue to harm investors.
In addition, given the lack of strong governance mechanisms at private funds, their
compliance programs take on added importance in protecting investors.17 We are proposing an
amendment to the Advisers Act compliance rule to require all SEC-registered advisers, including
those that do not manage private funds, to document the annual review of their compliance
policies and procedures in writing.18 Based on staff experience, some investment advisers do not
make and preserve written documentation of the annual review of their compliance policies and
procedures, which our examination staff relies on to help it understand an adviser’s compliance
program, determine whether the adviser is complying with the rule, and identify potential
weaknesses in the compliance program. Advisers can also rely on written documentation of the
annual review to promote an internal culture of compliance and accountability. We believe that
requiring written documentation would focus renewed attention on the importance of the annual
compliance review process and would result in records of annual compliance reviews that would
allow our staff to assess whether an adviser has complied with the review requirement of the
compliance rule.

II. DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED RULES FOR PRIVATE FUND ADVISERS
We are proposing a series of rules under the Advisers Act that would specifically address
these practices by advisers to private funds. The goal of this package of proposed reforms is to
protect those who directly or indirectly invest in private funds by increasing visibility into certain
practices, establishing requirements to address certain practices that have the potential to lead to
investor harm, and prohibiting adviser activity that we believe is contrary to the public interest
and the protection of investors. While some of the investor protection concerns identified herein
may relate to an adviser’s activities with regard to other client types (e.g., separately managed
accounts, pooled vehicles that are not private funds as defined in the Advisers Act), the proposed
reforms are designed to address concerns that arise out of the opacity that is prevalent in the
private fund structure. We also are proposing corresponding amendments to the books and
records requirements in rule 204-2.
We request comment on the following aspects of the package of proposed reforms:
• Are there certain activities that this package of proposed reforms would address in the
private fund context that we should also address in other contexts (e.g., separately
managed accounts)? Why or why not?
• Are there certain activities in the private fund context that this package of proposed
reforms is not addressing but that we should address?
A. Quarterly Statements
The proposed rule would require an investment adviser that is registered or required to be
registered with the Commission to prepare a quarterly statement that includes certain information
regarding fees, expenses, and performance for any private fund that it advises and distribute the
quarterly statement to the private fund’s investors within 45 days after each calendar quarter end,
unless a quarterly statement that complies with the proposed rule is prepared and distributed by
18
another person.
19 We believe that periodic statements detailing such information are necessary
to improve the quality of information provided to fund investors, allowing them to assess and
compare their private fund investments better. This information also would improve their ability
to monitor the private fund adviser to ensure compliance with the private fund’s governing
agreements and disclosures. While private fund advisers may currently provide statements to
investors, there is no requirement for advisers to do so under the Advisers Act regulatory regime.
We believe advisers should provide statements to help an investor better understand the
relationship between the fees and expenses the investor bears and the performance the investor
receives from the investment because of the opaque nature of the fees and expenses typically
associated with private fund investments. For example, a private fund’s governing documents
(e.g., limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement, or offering document)
may include broad characterizations of the types of potential fees and expenses. In other cases,
the fund’s governing documents may give the adviser significant discretion to determine which
fees and expenses relate to, and should be borne by, the fund. Examples of broad fee and
expense characterizations include “any and all fees and expenses related to the fund’s business or
activities,” “any and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the fund,”
and “any and all fees and expenses that the adviser shall determine to be related to the
establishment and operation of the fund.” These provisions do not provide investors sufficiently
detailed information regarding what fees and expenses will be charged, how much those fees and
expenses will be, and how often fees and expenses will be charged.
We believe that periodic statements containing certain required information would allow
investors to understand and monitor their private fund investments better. For example,

19 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2.
19
investors could check fees and expenses paid directly or indirectly by the private fund against the
private fund’s governing documents. This information may allow an investor to identify when
the private fund is incorrectly, or improperly, assessed a fee or expense by the adviser contrary to
the adviser’s fiduciary duty or the fund’s governing agreements or disclosures. As discussed in
more detail below, the proposed quarterly statement also would improve transparency for
investors into both the myriad ways an adviser and its related persons benefit from their
relationship with the private fund and the scope of potential conflicts of interests.
In addition, the proposed quarterly statement would allow a private fund investor to
compare cost and performance information across its private fund investments. This information
would help inform investment decisions, including whether to remain invested in certain private
funds or to invest in other private funds managed by the adviser or its related persons. More
broadly, this disclosure would help inform investors about the cost and performance dynamics of
this marketplace and potentially improve efficiency for future investments. For example, if an
investor owns interests in funds with similar investment strategies, the investor may be in a better
position to negotiate lower fee rates for future investments because the investor would be aware
of the rates charged by certain advisers in that segment of the market.
We recognize that many private fund advisers contractually agree to provide fee,
expense, and performance reporting to investors. For example, advisers may provide investors
with financial statements, schedules, or other reports regarding the fund and its activities.
However, not all private fund investors are able to obtain this information. Others may be able
to obtain information, but it may not be sufficiently clear or detailed reporting regarding the costs
and performance of a particular private fund. For example, some advisers report only aggregated
expenses, or do not provide detailed information about the calculation and implementation of any
20
negotiated rebates, credits, or offsets. Without clear, detailed disclosure, investors are unable to
measure and assess the impact fees and expenses have on their investment returns.
Reporting practices also vary across the private funds industry due to, among other
things, different forms and templates. Because the proposed requirement of quarterly statements
would involve a degree of standardization across the industry, we believe that investors would be
able to find and compare key information regarding fees, expenses, and performance for funds
with similar characteristics more easily than is the case today. This has the potential to, in our
view, bring greater efficiencies to the marketplace by improving investor decision making. For
example, investors likely would be able to compare adviser compensation across similar funds,
which may assist investors in determining whether to negotiate or renegotiate economic terms or
whether to invest or continue to invest in private funds managed by the adviser.
The proposed quarterly statement requirement would provide fund-wide reporting. We
believe this approach would help private fund investors compare the costs of investing across
private funds. We are not proposing to require private fund advisers to provide personalized
account statements showing each individual investor’s fees, expenses, and performance. The
proposed quarterly statements are designed, in part, to allow individual private fund investors to
use fund-level information to perform more personal, customized calculations. In addition, these
proposed requirements do not prevent an adviser from providing (or causing a third party, such
as an administrator, consultant, or other service provider, to provide), or an investor from
negotiating, personalized reporting. In the registered fund context, fund-level reporting has, in
our view, enabled retail investors to understand their investments better. We believe a
comparable approach, but one that is more suitable to the needs of investors in private funds, is
appropriate here.
21
We request comment on the following aspects of the proposed rule:
• Should we, as proposed, require advisers to private funds to prepare a quarterly
statement providing standardized disclosures regarding the cost of investing in the
private fund and the private fund’s performance and distribute the quarterly statement
to the fund’s investors? Should we instead require advisers to provide investors with
personalized information that takes into account the investors’ individual ownership
stake in the fund in addition to, or in lieu of, a statement covering the private fund? If
so, what information should be included in the personalized disclosure? For example,
should the statement reflect specific fee arrangements, including any offsets or
waivers applicable only to the investors receiving the statement? Do advisers
currently provide personalized fee, expense, and performance disclosures? If so,
what other types of information do advisers or funds typically include? Do they
automate such disclosures? How expensive and complex would it be for advisers to
create and deliver personalized disclosures? How useful would it be for investors to
receive personalized disclosures?
• Would investors find data regarding the private fund’s fees, expenses, and
performance useful given that certain investors may have different economic
arrangements with the adviser, such as fee breaks or expense caps? Should we
require advisers to disclose in the quarterly statement whether investors are subject to
different economic arrangements, whether documented in side letters or other written
agreements or, to the extent applicable, as a result of different class terms? If so,
should we require advisers to list the rates or otherwise show a range?
22
• Should the quarterly statement rule apply to registered advisers to private funds as
proposed or should it apply to all advisers to private funds? Should it apply to
exempt reporting advisers? Should the rule include any exceptions for categories of
advisers? If so, what conditions should apply to such an exception?
• Should the rule require advisers to prepare and distribute the quarterly statements
only to private fund investors, as proposed? Alternatively, should the rule require
advisers to provide quarterly statements to investors in other types of pooled
investment vehicles, such as a vehicle that relies on an exclusion from the definition
of “investment company” in section 3 of the Investment Company Act other than
section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act? For example, should we require advisers to
provide quarterly statements to investors in pooled investment vehicles that rely on
the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” in section 3(c)(5)(C) of
that Act?20
• The proposed rule would require an adviser to distribute the quarterly statement to the
private fund’s investors within 45 days after each calendar quarter end, unless such a
quarterly statement is prepared and distributed by another person. Would this
provision eliminate burdens where there are multiple advisers to the same fund, while
still providing the fund’s investors with the benefits of the quarterly statement?
Would the fund’s primary adviser typically prepare and distribute the quarterly
statement in these circumstances? How would advisers that do not prepare and

20 Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act provides an exclusion from the definition of investment
company for any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount
certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in the
business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.
23
distribute a quarterly statement in reliance on another adviser demonstrate compliance
with this requirement?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to prepare and distribute a quarterly
statement disclosing certain information regarding a private fund’s fees, expenses,
and performance. Are there alternative approaches we should require to improve
investor protection and bring greater efficiencies to the market? For example, should
we establish maximum fees that advisers may charge at the fund level? Should we
prohibit certain compensation arrangements, such as the “2 and 20” model? Should
we prohibit advisers from receiving compensation from portfolio investments to the
extent they also receive management fees from the fund? Should we require advisers
to disclose their anticipated management fee revenue and operating budget to private
fund investors or an LPAC or other similar body (despite the limitations of private
fund governance mechanisms, as discussed above) on an annual or more frequent
basis? Should we impose limitations on management fees (which are typically paid
regardless of whether the fund generates a profit), but not impose limitations on
performance-based compensation (which is typically tied to the success of the fund)?
Should we prohibit management fees from being charged as a percentage of
committed capital and instead only permit management fees to be based on invested
capital, net asset value, and other similar types of fee bases? Should we prohibit
certain expense practices or arrangements, such as expense caps provided to certain,
but not all, investors?
• Similarly, should we prohibit certain types of private fund performance information
in the quarterly statement? For example, should we prohibit advisers from presenting
24
performance with the impact of fund-level subscription facilities? Should we prohibit
advisers from presenting combined performance for multiple funds, such as a main
fund and a co-investment fund that pays lower or no fees?
• Do private fund advisers or their related persons receive other economic benefits that
the rule should require advisers to disclose in the quarterly statement? For example,
should the quarterly statement also require disclosure and quantification of the kinds
of economic benefits commonly received by advisers or their related persons from
broker-dealers or other service providers to private funds, such as hedge funds? Why
or why not?
1. Fee and Expense Disclosure
The proposed rule would require an investment adviser that is registered or required to be
registered to prepare and distribute quarterly statements with certain information regarding fees
and expenses, including fees and expenses paid by underlying portfolio investments to the
adviser or its related persons. While the types of fees and expenses charged to private funds can
vary across the industry, private funds are often more expensive than other asset classes because
the scope and magnitude of fees and expenses paid directly and indirectly by private fund
investors can be extensive. Investors typically compensate the adviser for managing the affairs
of the fund, often in the form of management fees.
21 On top of that, investors typically pay or
otherwise bear performance-based compensation.
22 A fund’s portfolio investments also may pay

21 Certain private fund advisers utilize a pass-through expense model where the private fund pays for most, if not
all, expenses, including the adviser’s expenses, but the adviser does not charge a management fee. See infra
section II.D.2. for a discussion of such pass-through expense models.
22 Investors typically enter into agreements under which the private fund pays such compensation directly to the
adviser or its affiliates. Investors generally bear such compensation indirectly through their investment in the
private fund; however, certain agreements may require investors to pay the adviser directly.
25
fees to the adviser or its related persons. For example, principals of the adviser may receive cash
or non-cash compensation – such as equity awards or stock options – for serving as directors of a
portfolio investment owned by the private fund. Portfolio investment compensation is typically
in addition to compensation paid or allocated to the adviser or its related persons at the fund
level, unless the fund’s governing documents require the adviser to offset portfolio investment
compensation against other revenue streams or otherwise provide a rebate to investors.
Compensation at the “portfolio investment-level” is more common for certain private funds –
such as private equity funds or real estate funds – and less common for others – such as hedge
funds.
Investors generally are required to bear all expenses related to the operation of the fund
and its portfolio investments. In addition to expenses such as organizational and offering
expenses, private fund investors also frequently bear expenses that vary based on the private
fund’s strategy and contractual agreements. For example, hedge fund investors indirectly bear
trading expenses. Investors in private equity and venture capital funds indirectly bear expenses
associated with fund investments, such as deal sourcing and due diligence expenses, including
for investments that are unconsummated. Investors in private funds with a real estate investment
strategy also indirectly bear expenses related to property management, environmental reviews,
and site inspections. These expenses generally are uncapped, and, unlike a fund’s performancebased compensation, private fund investors are typically required to bear them regardless of
whether the fund or the applicable investment generates a positive return for investors.
26
Investors often lack transparency regarding the total cost of such fees and expenses.23
For example, even though investors indirectly bear the costs associated with a portfolio
investment paying fees to the adviser or its related persons, advisers often do not disclose the
magnitude or scope of these fees to investors. Opaque reporting practices make it difficult for
investors to measure and evaluate performance accurately and to make informed investment
decisions.
24 Moreover, such reporting practices may prevent private fund investors from
assessing whether the type and amount of fees and expenses borne by the private fund comply
with the fund’s governing agreements and can lead to problematic compensation schemes and
sales practices with investors bearing excess or improper fees and expenses. The Commission
has brought enforcement actions related to the disclosure and allocation of fees and expenses by
private fund advisers. For example, we have alleged in settled enforcement actions that advisers
have received undisclosed fees,25 improperly shifted expenses away from the adviser,26 and
misallocated fees and expenses among private fund clients.
27 Staff has observed similarly

27
problematic compensation schemes and sales practices in its examinations of private fund
advisers.28 For example, staff has observed advisers that charge private funds for expenses not
permitted under the fund documents. Staff has also observed advisers improperly allocate shared
expenses, such as broken-deal, due diligence, and consultant expenses, among private fund
clients and their own accounts.
We have seen a significant increase in investors seeking transparency regarding fees and
expenses. For example, certain investors and industry groups have encouraged advisers to adopt
uniform reporting templates to promote transparency and alignment of interests between advisers
and investors.29 Despite these efforts, many advisers still do not voluntarily provide adequate
disclosure to investors. The proposed quarterly statement rule would mandate them to provide it.
a. Private Fund-Level Disclosure
The proposed quarterly statement rule would require private fund advisers to disclose the
following information to investors in a table format:
(1) A detailed accounting of all compensation, fees, and other amounts allocated or paid
to the adviser or any of its related persons by the private fund during the reporting period
(“adviser compensation”);
(2) A detailed accounting of all fees and expenses paid by the private fund during the
reporting period other than those listed in paragraph (1) above (“fund expenses”); and

28 See EXAMS Private Funds Risk Alert 2020, supra footnote 9.
29 See, e.g., Institutional Limited Partners Association (“ILPA”) Reporting Template, available at
https://ilpa.org/reporting-template/ (stating that, since its release, more than one hundred and forty organizations
have endorsed the ILPA reporting template, including more than twenty advisers).
28
(3) The amount of any offsets or rebates carried forward during the reporting period to
subsequent quarterly periods to reduce future payments or allocations to the adviser or its related
persons.
30
The table would provide investors with comprehensive fee and expense disclosure for the
prior quarterly period (or, in the case of a newly formed private fund’s initial quarterly statement,
its first two full calendar quarters of operating results).31 We will discuss each of these elements
in turn.
Adviser Compensation. The proposed rule would require the fund table to show a
detailed accounting of all adviser compensation during the reporting period, with separate line
items for each category of allocation or payment reflecting the total dollar amount.
32 The
proposed rule is designed to capture all compensation, fees, and other amounts allocated or paid
to the investment adviser or any of its related persons by the fund, including, but not limited to,
management, advisory, sub-advisory, or similar fees or payments, and performance-based
compensation.
33

30 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b).
31 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “reporting period” as the private fund’s calendar quarter covered by the
quarterly statement or, for the initial quarterly statement of a newly formed private fund, the period covering the
private fund’s first two full calendar quarters of operating results). To the extent a newly formed private fund
begins generating operating results on a day other than the first day of a calendar quarter (e.g., January 1), the
adviser should include such partial quarter and the immediately succeeding calendar quarters in the newly
formed private fund’s initial quarterly statement. For example, if a fund begins generating operating results on
February 1, the reporting period for the initial quarterly statement would cover the period beginning on
February 1 and ending on September 30.
32 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b)(1).
33 We propose to define “performance-based compensation” as allocations, payments, or distributions of capital
based on the private fund’s (or its portfolio investments’) capital gains and/or capital appreciation. This
definition’s scope is broad and includes cash or non-cash compensation, including, for example, in-kind
allocations, payments, or distributions of performance-based compensation. We believe that the broad scope of
the definition, which would capture, without limitation, carried interest, incentive fees, incentive allocations, or
profit allocations, among other forms of compensation, is appropriate given the various forms and types of
performance-based compensation across the private funds industry.
29
We believe requiring advisers to disclose all forms of adviser compensation as separate
line items (without prescribing particular categories of fees) is appropriate because it would
encompass the various forms of adviser compensation across the private funds industry. Many
private funds compensate advisers with a “2 and 20” arrangement, consisting of a 2%
management fee and a 20% share of any profits generated by the fund. Certain advisers,
however, receive other forms of compensation from private funds in addition to, or in lieu of,
such amounts. For example, certain advisers charge private funds administration fees or
servicing fees. The proposal would help ensure disclosure of the various forms of adviser
compensation, and the corresponding dollar amounts of each type of compensation, to current
investors regardless of how an adviser characterizes the compensation and regardless of the
different economic arrangements in place. This would allow investors to understand and assess
the magnitude and scope of adviser compensation better and help validate that adviser
compensation conforms to contractual agreements.
In addition to compensation paid to the adviser, the proposed rule would require
disclosure of compensation, fees, and other amounts allocated or paid to the adviser’s “related
persons.” We propose to define “related persons” to include: (i) all officers, partners, or
directors (or any person performing similar functions) of the adviser; (ii) all persons directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by the adviser; (iii) all current employees (other than
employees performing only clerical, administrative, support or similar functions) of the adviser;
and (iv) any person under common control with the adviser.34 The term “control” would be

34 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1. Form ADV also uses the same definition. The regulations at 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2
(rule 206(4)-2) use a similar definition by defining related person to include any person, directly or indirectly,
controlling or controlled by the adviser, and any person that is under common control with the adviser.
30
defined to mean the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of a
person, whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise.35
Many advisers conduct a single advisory business through multiple separate legal entities
or provide services to a private fund through different affiliated entities. The proposed “related
person” definition is designed to capture the various entities and personnel an adviser may use to
provide advisory services to, and receive compensation from, private fund clients. We
considered, but are not proposing, a broader definition of related persons to include additional
entities related to the adviser or its personnel, such as entities the adviser or its personnel own a
financial interest in but do not control. We are not proposing a broader definition because it
would likely capture entities or persons outside of the ones advisers typically use to conduct a
single advisory business. In addition, the proposed definition is consistent with the definition of
related person used on Form ADV, which advisers have experience assessing as part of their
disclosure obligations on that form. We believe that the proposed definition captures the
relevant entities without being overly broad.
Fund Fees and Expenses. The proposed rule would also require the fund table to show a
detailed accounting of all fees and expenses paid by the private fund during the reporting period,
other than those disclosed as adviser compensation, with separate line items for each category of

35 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1. The definition, in addition, provides that (i) each of an investment adviser’s officers,
partners, or directors exercising executive responsibility (or persons having similar status or functions) is
presumed to control the investment adviser; (ii) a person is presumed to control a corporation if the person: (A)
directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25% or more of a class of the corporation’s voting securities; or (B)
has the power to sell or direct the sale of 25% or more of a class of the corporation’s voting securities; (iii) a
person is presumed to control a partnership if the person has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has
contributed, 25% or more of the capital of the partnership; (iv) a person is presumed to control a limited liability
company if the person: (A) directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25% or more of a class of the interests of
the limited liability company; (B) has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 25% or more of
the capital of the limited liability company; or (C) is an elected manager of the limited liability company; or (v)
a person is presumed to control a trust if the person is a trustee or managing agent of the trust. Form ADV also
uses the same definition.
31
fee or expense reflecting the total dollar amount.
36 Similar to the approach taken with respect to
adviser compensation discussed above, the proposed rule would capture all fund fees and
expenses paid during the reporting period including, but not limited to, organizational,
accounting, legal, administration, audit, tax, due diligence, and travel expenses.
We have observed two general trends in the private funds industry that support this
approach. First, fund expenses have risen significantly in recent years for certain private funds
due to, among other things, complex fund structures, global marketing and investment efforts,
and increased service provider costs.
37 Advisers often pass on such increases to the private funds
they advise, without providing investors with detailed disclosure about the magnitude or type of
expenses actually charged to the fund. Second, certain advisers have shifted expenses related to
their advisory business to private fund clients.
38 For example, some advisers charge private fund
clients for salaries and benefits related to personnel of the adviser. Such expenses historically
have been paid by advisers with management fee proceeds or other revenue streams, but are
increasingly being charged as separate expenses that may not be transparent to fund investors.
39
The proposed quarterly statement rule would require a detailed accounting of each
category of fund expense. This would require advisers to list each specific category of expense
as a separate line item, rather than permit advisers to group fund expenses into broad categories.

36 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b)(2).
37 See, e.g., Coming to Terms: Private Equity Investors Face Rising Costs, Extra Fees (Dec. 20, 2021), available

(2021) (“ILPA Key Findings Report”), available at https://ilpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Key-FindingsIndustry-Intelligence-Report-Fund-Terms.pdf.
38 Such practice is often not disclosed, or not fully disclosed, in private fund documents.
39 See ILPA Key Findings Report, supra footnote 37.
32
For example, if a fund paid insurance premiums, administrator expenses, and audit fees during
the reporting period, a general reference to “fund expenses” on the quarterly statement would not
satisfy the detailed accounting requirement. Instead, an adviser would be required to list each
specific category of expense (i.e., insurance premiums, administrator expenses, and audit fees),
and the corresponding dollar amount, separately. As with adviser compensation, we believe this
approach would provide private fund investors with sufficient detail to validate that the fund
expenses borne by the fund conform to contractual agreements.
To the extent a fund expense also could be characterized as adviser compensation under
the proposed rule, the proposed rule would require advisers to disclose such payment or
allocation as adviser compensation and not as a fund expense in the quarterly statement. For
example, certain private funds may engage the adviser or its related persons to provide services
to the fund, such as consulting, legal, or back-office services. An adviser would disclose any
compensation, fees, or other amounts allocated or paid by the fund for such services as part of
the detailed accounting of adviser compensation. This approach would help ensure that investors
understand the entire amount of adviser compensation allocated or paid to the adviser and its
related persons during the reporting period.
Offsets, Rebates, and Waivers. We are proposing to require advisers to disclose adviser
compensation and fund expenses in the fund table both before and after the application of any
offsets, rebates, or waivers.40 Specifically, the proposed rule would require an adviser to present
the dollar amount of each category of adviser compensation or fund expense before and after any
such reduction for the reporting period.

40 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b).
33
Advisers may offset, rebate, or waive adviser compensation or fund expenses in a number
of circumstances. For example, a private equity adviser may enter into a management services
agreement with a fund’s portfolio company, requiring the company to pay the adviser a fee for
those services. To the extent the fund’s governing agreement requires the adviser to share the
fee with the fund investors through an offset to the management fee, the management fee would
typically be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount equal to the fee.
41 Under the
proposed rule, the adviser would be required to list the management fee both before and after the
application of the fee offset.
42
We considered whether to require advisers to disclose adviser compensation and fund
expenses only after the application of offsets, rebates, and waivers, rather than before and after.
We recognize that investors may find the reduced numbers more meaningful, given that they
generally reflect the actual amounts borne by the fund during the reporting period. We believe,
however, that presenting both figures would provide investors with greater transparency into
advisers’ fee and expense practices, particularly with respect to how offsets, rebates, and waivers
affect adviser compensation. Transparency into fee and expense practices is important because it
would assist investors in monitoring their private fund investments and, for certain investors,
would ease their own efforts at complying with their reporting obligations.43 We also believe
that advisers would have this information readily available and both sets of figures would be
helpful to investors in monitoring whether and how offsets, rebates, and waivers are applied.

41 The offset shifts some or all of the economic benefit of the fee from the adviser to the private fund investors.
42 Offsets, rebates, and waivers applicable to certain, but not all, investors through one or more separate
arrangements would be required to be reflected and described prominently in the fund-wide numbers presented
in the quarterly statement. See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(d) and (g).
43 For example, certain investors, such as U.S. state pension plans, may be required to report complete information
regarding fees and expenses paid to the adviser and its related persons.
34
In addition, we are proposing to require advisers to disclose the amount of any offsets or
rebates carried forward during the reporting period to subsequent periods to reduce future adviser
compensation.
44 This information would allow investors to understand whether they are or the
fund is entitled to additional reductions in future periods.45 Further, we believe that this
information would assist investors with their liquidity management and cash flow models, as
they would have greater insight into the fund’s projected cash flows and their obligations to
satisfy future capital calls for adviser compensation with cash on hand.
We request comment on all aspects of the proposed content of the fund fee and expense
table, including the following items:
• Should we require advisers to disclose all compensation and fund expenses as proposed?
Do commenters agree with the scope of the proposal? Why or why not?
• Would the proposed content result in fund-level fee and expense disclosure that is
meaningful to investors? Are there other items that advisers should be required to
disclose in the fund table? Are there any proposed items that we should eliminate?
Would more or less information about the fees and expenses charged to the fund be
helpful for investors? Are there any revisions to the descriptions of fees that would make
the proposed disclosure more useful to investors?
• Instead of the proposed approach, should we prescribe a template for the fund table?
Would the increased comparability of a template be useful to investors? Would a

44 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b)(3).
45 To the extent advisers are required to offset fund-level compensation (e.g., management fees) by portfolio
investment compensation (e.g., monitoring fees), they typically do not reduce adviser compensation below zero,
meaning that, in the event the monitoring fee offset amount exceeds the management fee for the applicable
period, some fund documents provide for “carryforwards” of the unused amount. The carryforwards are used to
offset the management fee in subsequent periods.
35
template be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the types of fees and expenses as
well as the types of offsets, rebates, or waivers used by private fund advisers? Would a
template necessitate repeated updating as the industry evolves?
• Should we include any additional definitions of terms or phrases for the fund table?
Should we omit any definitions we have proposed for the fund table?
• The proposed rule would require an adviser to include the compensation paid to a related
person sub-adviser in its quarterly statement. For private funds that have sub-advisers
that are not related persons, should we require a single quarterly statement showing all
adviser compensation (at both the adviser and sub-adviser levels)? In cases where a nonrelated person sub-adviser does not prepare a quarterly account statement in reliance on
the adviser’s preparation and distribution of the quarterly statement to the fund’s
investors, how would advisers reflect the compensation paid to the sub-adviser and its
related persons? Do commenters agree that such compensation would be captured as a
fund expense? Should we require a separate table covering these fees and expenses, as
well as a separate table showing portfolio investment compensation paid to the subadviser or its related person? How would advisers operationalize this requirement in
these circumstances?
• Should we adopt the proposed definitions of “related persons” and “control” as proposed?
Are they too broad? Are the proposed definitions broad enough? Should we add former
personnel of the adviser or its related persons to the proposed definition? If so, for how
long after a departure from the adviser or its related persons should such personnel fall
into the definition? Should the definition of related person include family members of
adviser personnel or persons who share the same household with adviser personnel?
36
Should the definition capture any person directly or indirectly controlled by the adviser’s
officers, partners, or directors (including any consulting firms controlled by such
persons)? Should it capture operational partners, senior advisors, or other similar
consultants of the adviser, the private fund, or its portfolio investments? Should we add
any entity more than five percent of the ownership of which is held, directly or indirectly,
by the adviser or its personnel? Should the definition include any person that receives,
directly or indirectly, management fees or performance based compensation from, or in
respect of, the fund; or any person that has an interest in the investment adviser or general
partner (or similar control person) of the fund? If we adopt a different definition of
“related person” than what is being proposed, should we use a different defined term
(such as “related party”) to avoid confusion given that the term “related person” is
defined in Form ADV?
• For purposes of the definition of “control,” are the control presumptions appropriate in
this context? Should we eliminate or modify any of the presumptions? For example,
should we eliminate aspects of the definition that may capture passive investors who do
not have the power to direct the management or policies of the relevant entity? Why or
why not? Should we add any additional control presumptions? For example, should an
entity be presumed to be controlled by an adviser to the extent the adviser has authority
over the entity’s budget or whether to hire personnel or terminate their employment?
37
• The proposed rule includes a non-exhaustive list of certain types of adviser compensation
and fund expenses.
46 Would this information assist advisers in complying with the rule?
Should we add any additional types? If so, which ones and why?
• Do private fund advisers or their related persons receive other economic benefits that the
rule should require advisers to disclose in the quarterly statement? For example, should
we require hedge fund advisers to disclose the dollar amount of any soft dollar or similar
benefits provided by broker-dealers that execute trades for the funds, or any benefits
provided by hedge fund prime brokers?
• Do commenters agree with the scope of the proposed definition of “performance-based
compensation”? Should we specify the types of compensation that should be included in
the definition? For example, should the definition specify that the term includes carried
interest, incentive fees, incentive allocations, performance fees, or profit allocations?
• Should we only require the table to disclose adviser compensation and fund expenses
after the application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers, rather than before and after, as
proposed? If so, why?
• Should we define offsets, rebates, and waivers? If so, what definitions should we use and
why? Are there any types of offsets, rebates, and waivers that we should not require
advisers to reflect in the fund table? If so, which ones and why? To the extent that
offsets, rebates, or waivers are available to certain, but not all, investors, are there any
operational concerns with reflecting and describing those offsets, rebates, or waivers in

46 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b)(1) includes the following non-exhaustive list of adviser compensation:
management, advisory, sub-advisory, or similar fees or payments, and performance-based compensation.
Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(b)(2) includes the following non-exhaustive list of fund expenses: organizational,
accounting, legal, administration, audit, tax, due diligence, and travel fees and expenses.
38
the fund-wide numbers presented in the quarterly statement? Are there alternatives we
should use?
• Should we require advisers to disclose the amount of any offsets or rebates carried
forward during the reporting period to subsequent periods to reduce future adviser
compensation as proposed? Would this information be helpful for investors? Do
advisers already provide this information in the fund’s financial statements or otherwise?
• Should we require advisers to provide any additional disclosures regarding fees and
expenses in the quarterly statement? In particular, should we require any disclosures
from an investment adviser’s Form ADV Part 2A narrative brochure (if applicable) to be
included in the quarterly statement, such as more details about an investment adviser’s
fees?
• Should we tailor the disclosure requirements based on fund type? For example, should
the requirements or format for hedge funds differ from the requirements and format for
private equity funds? Are there unique fees or expenses for types of funds that advisers
should be required to disclose or otherwise list as a separate line item? If so, how should
we define these types of funds for these purposes? For example, should we use the
definitions of such terms used on Form ADV?
• Do any of the proposed requirements impose unnecessary costs or compliance
challenges? Please provide specific data. Are there any modifications to the proposal
that we could make that would lower those costs or mitigate those challenges? Please
provide examples.
• The proposed quarterly statement prescribes minimum fee and expense information that
must be included. What are the benefits and drawbacks of prescribing the minimum
39
disclosure to be included in the quarterly statement and otherwise permitting advisers to
include additional information? Do commenters agree that we should allow advisers to
include additional information? Would the inclusion of additional information affect
whether investors review the quarterly statement?
• Certain advisers use management fee waivers where the amount of management fees paid
by the fund to the adviser is reduced in exchange for an increased interest in fund
profits.47 Because fund agreements often document such waivers with complex and
highly technical tax provisions, should we provide guidance to assist advisers in
complying with the proposed requirement to describe the manner in which they are
calculated or specify a methodology for such calculations?
• Should we permit advisers to exclude expenses from the quarterly statement if they are
below a certain threshold? Alternatively, should we permit advisers to group expenses
into broad categories and disclose them under single line item – such as “Miscellaneous
Expenses” or “Other Expenses” – if the aggregate amount is de minimis relative to the
fund’s size? Why or why not?
• The proposed rule would require the initial quarterly statement for newly formed funds to
include start-up and organizational fees of the fund if they were paid during the reporting
period. Instead, should the proposed rule exclude those fees and expenses?
• Should the table provide fee and expense information for any other periods? For
example, should we require advisers to disclose all adviser compensation and fund
expenses since inception (in addition to adviser compensation and fund expenses

47 Management fee waiver arrangements often provide certain economic benefits for the adviser, such as the
possibility of reducing and/or deferring certain tax obligations.
40
allocated or paid during the applicable reporting period)? If so, should we require sinceinception information only for certain types of funds, such as closed-end private funds,
and not for other types of funds, such as open-end private funds?
• We recognize that certain private fund advisers may already provide quarterly account or
similar statements to investors, such as advisers that rely on an exemption from certain
disclosure and recordkeeping requirements provided by U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission regulations at 17 CFR 4.7. How often are private fund advisers separately
required to provide such quarterly statements, and how often do they do so even when not
required? Would there be any overlap between the proposed quarterly statement and the
existing quarterly account or similar statements currently prepared by advisers?
b. Portfolio Investment-Level Disclosure
The proposed quarterly statement rule would require advisers to disclose the following
information with respect to any covered portfolio investment,
48 in a single table covering all such
covered portfolio investments:
(1) A detailed accounting of all portfolio investment compensation allocated or paid by
each covered portfolio investment during the reporting period;
49 and
(2) The private fund’s ownership percentage of each such covered portfolio investment as
of the end of the reporting period or, if the fund does not have an ownership interest in the
covered portfolio investment, the adviser would be required to list zero percent as the fund’s

48 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “covered portfolio investment” as a portfolio investment that allocated
or paid the investment adviser or its related persons portfolio investment compensation during the reporting
period).
49 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “portfolio investment compensation” as any compensation, fees, and
other amounts allocated or paid to the investment adviser or any of its related persons by the portfolio
investment attributable to the private fund’s interest in such portfolio investment).
41
ownership percentage along with a brief description of the fund’s investment in such covered
portfolio investment.
50
The proposed rule defines “portfolio investment” as any entity or issuer in which the
private fund has invested directly or indirectly.
51 This definition is designed to capture any
entity or issuer in which the private fund holds an investment including through holding
companies, subsidiaries, acquisition vehicles, special purpose vehicles, and other vehicles
through which investments are made or otherwise held by the private fund.
52 As a result, the
proposed definition may capture more than one entity or issuer with respect to any single
investment made by a private fund. For example, if a private fund invests directly in a holding
company that owns two subsidiaries, the proposed definition would capture all three entities.
Depending on a private fund’s underlying investment structure, an adviser may have to
determine, in good faith, which entity or entities constitute the portfolio investment under the
proposed rule.
We considered, but are not proposing, using the term “portfolio company,” rather than
“portfolio investment.” We believe that the term “portfolio company” would be too narrow
given that some private funds do not invest in traditional operating companies. For example,
certain private funds originate loans and invest in credit-related instruments, while others invest
in more bespoke assets such as music royalties, aircraft, and tanker vessels. The proposed rule

50 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(c).
51 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1.
52 Certain investment strategies can involve complex transactions and the use of negotiated instruments or
contracts, such as derivatives, with counterparties. Although such trading involves a risk that a counterparty
will not settle a transaction or otherwise fail to perform its obligations under the instrument or contract and thus
result in losses to the fund, we would generally not consider the fund to have made an investment in the
counterparty in this context. We believe this approach is appropriate because any gain or loss from the
investment generally would be tied to the performance of the derivative and the underlying reference security,
rather than the performance of the counterparty.
42
would define “portfolio investment” to apply to all types of private fund investments and
structures. The proposed definition also is designed to remain evergreen, capturing new
investment structures as they continue to evolve.
We recognize, however, that portfolio investments of certain private funds may not pay
or allocate portfolio-investment compensation to an adviser or its related persons. For example,
advisers to hedge funds focusing on passive investments in public companies may be less likely
to receive portfolio-investment compensation than advisers to private equity funds focusing on
control-oriented investments in private companies. Under the proposed rule, advisers would
only be required to disclose information regarding covered portfolio investments, which we
propose to define as portfolio investments that allocated or paid the investment adviser or its
related persons portfolio investment compensation during the reporting period.
53 We believe this
approach is appropriate because the portfolio investment table is designed to highlight the scope
and magnitude of any investment-level compensation as well as to improve transparency for
investors into the potential conflicts of interest of the adviser and its related persons. If an
adviser does not receive such compensation, we do not believe the adviser should have such a
reporting obligation. Accordingly, the proposed rule would not require advisers to list any
information regarding portfolio investments that do not fall within the covered portfolio
investment definition for the applicable reporting period. These advisers, however, would need
to identify portfolio investment payments and allocations in order to know whether they must
provide the disclosures under this requirement.
Portfolio Investment Compensation. The proposed rule would require the portfolio
investment table to show a detailed accounting of all portfolio investment compensation

53 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “covered portfolio investment”).
43
allocated or paid by each covered portfolio investment during the reporting period, with separate
line items for each category of allocation of payment reflecting the total dollar amount, including
(though it is not limited to) origination, management, consulting, monitoring, servicing,
transaction, administrative, advisory, closing, disposition, directors, trustees or similar fees or
payments by the covered portfolio investment to the investment adviser or any of its related
persons. An adviser should disclose the identity of each covered portfolio investment to the
extent necessary for an investor to understand the nature of the conflicts associated with such
payments.
Similar to the approach taken with respect to adviser compensation and fund expenses
discussed above, the proposed rule would require a detailed accounting of all portfolio
investment compensation paid or allocated to the adviser and its related persons.
54 This would
require advisers to list each specific type of portfolio investment compensation, and the
corresponding dollar amount, as a separate line item. We believe that this approach is
appropriate given that portfolio investment compensation can take many different forms and
often varies based on fund type. For example, portfolio investments of private credit funds may
pay the adviser a servicing fee for managing a pool of loans held directly or indirectly by the
fund. Portfolio investments of private real estate funds may pay the adviser a property
management fee or a mortgage-servicing fee for managing the real estate investments held
directly or indirectly by the fund.
We believe that this disclosure would inform investors about the scope of portfolio
investment compensation paid to the adviser and related persons, and could help provide insight

54 Because advisers often use separate legal entities to conduct a single advisory business, the proposed rule would
capture portfolio investment compensation paid to an adviser’s related persons.
44
into some of the conflicts of interest some advisers face. For example, in cases where the adviser
controls the portfolio investment, the adviser also generally has discretion over whether to charge
portfolio investment compensation and, if so, the rate, timing, method, amount, and recipient of
such compensation. Additionally, where the private fund’s governing documents require the
adviser to offset portfolio investment compensation against other revenue streams or otherwise
provide a rebate to investors, this information would also help investors monitor the application
of such offsets or rebates.
The proposed rule would require the adviser to disclose the amount of portfolio
investment compensation attributable to the private fund’s interest in the covered portfolio
investment.
55 Such amount would not reflect the portion attributable to any other person’s
interest in the covered portfolio investment. For example, if the private fund and another person
co-invested in the same portfolio investment and the portfolio investment paid the private fund’s
adviser a monitoring fee, the table would only list the total dollar amount of the monitoring fee
attributable to the fund’s interest. We believe this approach is appropriate because it would
reflect the amount borne by the fund and, by extension, the investors. This would be meaningful
information for investors because the amount attributable to the fund’s interest typically reduces
the value of investors’ indirect interest in the portfolio investment.56 Subject to the requirements
of the proposed rule, advisers may, but are not required to, also list the portion of the fee
attributable to any other investor’s interest in the portfolio investment.

55 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “portfolio investment compensation”).
56 We believe that this information would be meaningful for investors regardless of whether the private fund has
an equity ownership interest or another kind of interest in the covered portfolio investment. For example, if a
private fund’s interest in a covered portfolio investment is represented by a debt instrument, the amount of
portfolio-investment compensation paid or allocated to the adviser may hinder or prevent the covered portfolio
investment from satisfying its obligations to the fund under the debt instrument.
45
Similar to the approach discussed above with respect to adviser compensation and fund
expenses, an adviser would be required to list the amount of portfolio investment compensation
allocated or paid with respect to each covered portfolio investment both before and after the
application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers. This would require an adviser to present the
aggregate dollar amount attributable to the fund’s interest before and after any such reduction for
the reporting period. Advisers would be required to disclose the amount of any portfolio
investment compensation they initially charge and the amount they ultimately retain at the
expense of the private fund and its investors. As with adviser compensation and fund expenses,
we believe this approach would provide investors with sufficient detail to validate that portfolio
investment compensation borne by the fund conforms to contractual agreements.
Ownership Percentage. The proposed rule would require the portfolio investment table
to list the fund’s ownership percentage of each covered portfolio investment that paid or
allocated portfolio-investment compensation to the adviser or its related persons during the
reporting period.
57 The adviser would be required to determine the fund’s ownership percentage
as of the end of the reporting period. We believe that this information would provide investors
with helpful context of the amount of portfolio investment compensation paid or allocated to the
adviser or its related persons relative to the fund’s ownership. For example, portfolio investment
compensation may be calculated based on the portfolio investment’s total enterprise value or
other similar metric. We believe that the fund’s ownership percentage would help private fund
investors understand and assess the magnitude of such compensation, as well as how it affects
the value of the fund’s investment.

57 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(c)(2). An adviser should also list zero percent as the ownership percentage if the
fund has sold or completely written off its ownership interest in the covered portfolio investment during the
reporting period.
46
We recognize that calculating the fund’s ownership percentage may be difficult in certain
circumstances, especially for funds that do not make equity investments in operating companies.
For example, a private equity secondaries fund may own a preferred security or a hybrid
instrument that entitles the fund to priority distributions until it receives a certain return on its
initial investment. A direct lending fund may provide a loan to a company that entitles the fund
to receive interest payments and a return of principal. If the fund does not have an ownership
interest in the covered portfolio investment, such as when the fund holds a debt instrument, the
adviser would be required to list zero percent as the fund’s ownership percentage, along with a
brief description of the fund’s investment in the portfolio investment table, if the covered
portfolio investment paid or allocated portfolio-investment compensation to adviser or its related
persons during the reporting period.
We request comment on all aspects of the proposed content of the portfolio investment
table, including the following items:
• Would the proposed rule provide portfolio investment compensation disclosure that is
meaningful to investors? Should the rule require advisers to disclose additional or
different information in the portfolio-investment table? Would more information about
the fees and expenses charged to portfolio investments be helpful for investors?
• Should we include any additional definitions of terms or phrases for the portfolioinvestment table? Should we omit any definitions we have proposed for the portfolioinvestment table?
• Is the proposed definition of “portfolio investment” clear? Should we modify or revise
the proposed definition? For example, should we define “portfolio investment” as any
person whose securities are beneficially owned by the private fund or any person in
47
which the private fund owns an equity or debt interest? Alternatively, should we define
“portfolio investment” as any underlying company, business, platform, issuer, or other
person in which the private fund has made, directly or indirectly, an investment? Should
we permit advisers to determine, in good faith, which entity or entities constitute the
portfolio investment for purposes of the quarterly statement rule? For example, a fund of
funds may indirectly invest in hundreds of issuers or entities. Depending on the
underlying structure, control relationship, and reporting, the fund of funds’ adviser may
have limited knowledge regarding such underlying entities or issuers. Should we exclude
such entities or issuers from the definition of portfolio investment for such advisers? Is
there a different standard or test we should use? Should we require such adviser to
conduct a reasonable amount of diligence consistent with past practice and/or industry
standards? Why or why not?
• As discussed above, to the extent a private fund enters into a negotiated instrument, such
as a derivative, with a counterparty, we would not consider the private fund to have made
an investment in the counterparty. Do commenters agree with this approach? Why or
why not? Should we adopt a different approach for derivatives or other similar
instruments generally? For purposes of determining whether the fund has made an
investment in an issuer or entity, should we only include equity investments? Should we
exclude derivatives? Why or why not? How should exchange-traded (i.e., not
negotiated) derivatives, including swaps and options, be treated for purposes of the rule?
• The proposed definition of portfolio investment would not distinguish among different
types of private funds. Is our approach in this respect appropriate or should we treat
certain funds differently depending on their strategy or fund type? If so, how should we
48
reflect that treatment? For example, should we modify the definition with respect to a
real estate fund to reflect that such a fund generally invests in real estate assets, rather
than operating companies? Because a secondaries fund may indirectly invest in a
significant number of underlying operating companies or other assets, should we limit the
“indirect” component of the definition for such funds (or any other funds that may have
indirect exposure to a significant number of companies or assets)? Why or why not?
Would additional definitions be appropriate or useful? Should the proposed rule define
the term “entity” and/or “issuer”? If so, how? Should the proposed rule treat hedge
funds, liquidity funds, and other open-end private funds differently than private equity
funds and other closed-end private funds?
• Should we adopt the approach with respect to portfolio-investment compensation as
proposed? Do commenters agree with the scope of the proposal? Why or why not?
• The proposed rule includes non-exhaustive lists of certain types of fees. Would this
information assist advisers in complying with the rule? Should we add any additional
types? If so, which ones and why?
• Should we require advisers to list each type of portfolio-investment compensation as a
separate line item as proposed? Would this level of detail be helpful for investors with
respect to portfolio-investment reporting? Given that many funds require a management
fee offset of all portfolio-investment compensation, is this level of detail necessary or
useful to investors? Should we instead require advisers to provide aggregate information
for each covered portfolio investment?
49
• Should the rule permit advisers to use project or deal names or other codes, and if so,
what additional disclosures are necessary for an investor to understand the nature of the
conflicts?
• We considered only requiring advisers to disclose the amount of portfolio investment
compensation after the application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers, rather than before
and after. We believe the proposed approach would be more helpful for investors
because investors would have greater insight into the compensation advisers initially
charge and the amount they ultimately retain at the expense of the private fund and its
investors. Do commenters agree? Why or why not?
• Would information about a firm’s services to portfolio investments be helpful for
investors? Are there any elements of the proposed requirements that firms should or
should not include? If so, which ones and why?
• We considered requiring advisers to disclose the total portfolio-investment compensation
for the reporting period as an aggregate number, rather than providing the amount of
compensation allocated or paid by each covered portfolio investment as proposed.
However, we believe that investment-by-investment information would provide investors
with greater transparency into advisers’ fee and expense practices and thus be more
helpful for investors. Do commenters agree? Should we require advisers to report a
consolidated “top-line” number that covers all covered portfolio investments?
• Should we define the term “ownership interest”? If so, how should we define it? For
purposes of the rule, should a private fund be deemed to hold an “ownership interest” in a
covered portfolio investment only to the extent the fund has made an equity investment in
50
the covered portfolio investment? Why or why not? What types of funds may not hold
an “ownership interest” in a covered portfolio investment?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to list the fund’s ownership percentage of each
covered portfolio investment. Because the definition of “portfolio investment” could
capture more than one entity, will advisers be able to calculate the fund’s ownership
percentage? Are there any changes to the proposed rule text that could mitigate this
challenge? If a portfolio investment captures multiple entities, should we require
advisers to list the fund’s overall ownership of such entities? If so, what criteria should
advisers use to determine a fund’s overall ownership?
• Should we require advisers to disclose how they allocate or apportion portfolioinvestment compensation among multiple private funds invested in the same covered
portfolio investment? If so, how should the portfolio investment table reflect this
information?
• Certain advisers have discretion or substantial influence over whether to cause a fund’s
portfolio investment to compensate the adviser or its related persons. Should the
requirement to disclose portfolio-investment compensation apply only to advisers that
have such discretion or authority? Should such requirement apply if the adviser is
entitled to appoint one or more directors to the portfolio investment’s board of directors
or similar governing body (if applicable)? Is there another standard we should require?
• We recognize that certain private funds, such as quantitative and algorithmic funds and
other similar funds, may have thousands of holdings and/or transactions during a quarter
and that those funds typically do not receive portfolio investment compensation. While
the proposed rule would not require an adviser to include any portfolio investment that
51
did not pay or allocate portfolio-investment compensation to the adviser or its related
persons during the reporting period in its quarterly statement, these advisers would need
to consider how to identify such portfolio investment’s payments and allocations for
purposes of complying with this disclosure requirement. Should the rule provide any full
or partial exceptions for such funds? Should we require investment-level disclosure for
quantitative, algorithmic, and other similar funds only where they own above a specified
threshold percentage of the portfolio investment? For example, should such funds only
be required to provide investment-level disclosure where they own 25% or more
ownership of any class of voting shares? Alternatively, should we use a lower ownership
threshold, such as 20%, 10%, or 5%? Should we adopt a similar approach for all private
funds, rather than just quantitative, algorithmic, and other similar funds? If so, what
threshold should we apply? For instance, should it be 5%? Or 10%? A higher
percentage?
• Should we exclude certain types of private funds from these disclosures? If so, which
funds and how should we define them? For example, should we exclude private funds
that only hold (or primarily hold) publicly traded securities, such as hedge funds?
• Should we require layered disclosure for the portfolio-investment table (i.e., short
summaries of certain information with references and links to other disclosures where
interested investors can find more information)? Would this approach encourage
investors to ask questions and seek more information about the adviser’s practices? Are
there modifications or alternatives we should impose to improve the utility of the
information for private fund investors, such as requiring the quarterly statement to
present information in a tabular format?
52
• Are there particular funds that may require longer quarterly statements than other funds?
Please provide data regarding the number of funds that have covered portfolio
investments and, with respect to those funds, the number of covered portfolio investments
per private fund. Should the Commission take into account the fact that certain funds
will have more covered portfolio investments than other funds? For example, should we
require funds that have more than a specific number of covered portfolio investments,
such as 50 or more covered portfolio investments, to provide only portfolio-investment
level reporting for a subset of their covered portfolio investments, such as a specific
number of their largest holdings during the reporting period (e.g., their largest ten, fifteen,
or twenty holdings)?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to list zero percent as the ownership percentage
if the fund has completely sold or completely written off its ownership interest in the
covered portfolio investment during the reporting period. Instead, should we require or
permit advisers to exclude any such portfolio investments from the table? Why or why
not?
• The proposed rule would require the adviser to disclose the amount of portfolio
investment compensation attributable to the private fund’s interest in the covered
portfolio investment that is paid or allocated to the adviser and its related persons.
Should we require disclosure of portfolio compensation paid to other persons (such as coinvestors, joint venture partners, and other third parties) to the extent such compensation
reduces the value of the private fund’s interest in the portfolio investment?
53
c. Calculations and Cross References to Organizational and Offering
Documents
The proposed quarterly statement rule would require each statement to include prominent
disclosure regarding the manner in which expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, waivers, and
offsets are calculated.58 This would generally have the effect of requiring advisers to describe,
for example, the structure of, and the method used to determine, any performance-based
compensation set forth in the statement (such as the distribution waterfall, if applicable) and the
criteria on which each type of compensation is based (e.g., whether compensation is fixed, based
on performance over a certain period, or based on the value of the fund’s assets). We believe
that this disclosure would assist private fund investors in understanding and evaluating the
adviser’s calculations.
To facilitate an investor’s ability to seek additional information, the quarterly statement
also must include cross references to the relevant sections of the private fund’s organizational
and offering documents that set forth the calculation methodology.
59 References to these
disclosures would be valuable so that the investor can compare what the private fund’s
documents state the fund (and indirectly the investors) will be obligated to pay to what the fund
(and indirectly the investors) actually paid during the reporting period and more easily determine
the accuracy of the charges. For example, including this information on the quarterly statement
would likely enable an investor to confirm that the adviser calculated advisory fees in accordance
with the fund’s organizational and offering documents and to identify whether the adviser
deducted or charged incorrect or unauthorized amounts. We believe this information also would
allow the investor to assess the effect those fees and costs have had on its investment.

58 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(d).
59 Id.
54
We request comment on the following aspects of the proposed rule:
• Should we allow flexibility in the words advisers use, as proposed, or should we require
advisers to include prescribed wording in disclosing calculation methodology? If the
latter, what prescribed wording would be helpful for investors? Does the narrative style
work or are there other presentation formats that we should require?
• Should we provide additional guidance or specify additional requirements regarding what
type of disclosure generally should or must be included to describe the manner in which
expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, waivers, and offsets are calculated? For
example, should we provide sample disclosures describing various calculations? Should
the rule require advisers to restate disclosures from offering memoranda (if applicable)
regarding the manner in which expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, waivers, and
offsets are calculated in the quarterly statement? Do commenters believe that advisers
would prefer to restate offering memoranda disclosures rather than drafting new
disclosures to avoid conflicting interpretations of potentially complex fund terms?
Should the rule only require advisers to provide a cross reference to the language in the
fund’s governing documents regarding this information (e.g., identifying the relevant
document and page or section numbers)?
• Would providing cross references, as proposed, to the relevant sections of the private
fund’s organizational and offering documents be helpful for investors? Would it permit
investors to “cross check” or evaluate the adviser’s calculations? Are there other
alternatives that would achieve our objectives?
55
2. Performance Disclosure
In addition to providing information regarding fees and expenses, the proposed rule
would require an adviser to include standardized fund performance information in each quarterly
statement provided to fund investors. The proposed rule would require an adviser to a liquid
fund (as defined below) to show performance based on net total return on an annual basis since
the fund’s inception, over prescribed time periods, and on a quarterly basis for the current year.
For illiquid funds (also defined below), the proposed rule would require an adviser to show
performance based on the internal rate of return and a multiple of invested capital. The proposed
rule would require an adviser to display the different categories of required performance
information with equal prominence.60
It is essential that quarterly statements include performance in order to enable investors to
compare private fund investments and comprehensively understand their existing investments
and determine what to do holistically with their overall investment portfolio. A quarterly
statement that includes fee, expense, and performance information would allow investors to
monitor for abnormalities and better understand the impact of fees and expenses on their
investments. For example, a quarterly statement that includes fee and expense, but not
performance, information would not allow an investor to perform a cost-benefit analysis to
determine whether to retain the current investment or consider other options or, for an investor in
an illiquid fund, to determine whether to invest in other private funds managed by the same
adviser. In addition, current clients or investors may use fee, expense, and performance

60 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(2). For example, the proposed rule would require an adviser to an illiquid fund to
show gross internal rate of return with the same prominence as net internal rate of return. Similarly, the
proposed rule would require an adviser to a liquid fund to show the annual net total return for each calendar
year with the same prominence as the cumulative net total return for the current calendar year as of the end of
the most recent calendar quarter covered by the quarterly statement.
56
information about their current investments to inform their overall investment decisions (e.g.,
whether to diversify) and their view of the market.
Although there are commonalities between the performance reporting elements of the
proposed rule and the performance elements of our recently adopted marketing rule, the two
rules satisfy somewhat different policy goals. Our experience has led us to believe that, while all
clients and investors should be protected against misleading, deceptive, and confusing
information, as is the policy goal of the marketing rule,61 the needs of current clients and
investors often differ in some respects from the needs of prospective clients and investors, as
detailed below. Current investors should receive performance reporting that allows them to
evaluate an investment alongside corresponding fee and expense information. Current investors
also should receive performance reporting that is provided at timely, predictable intervals so that
an investor can monitor and evaluate its investment progress over time, remain abreast of
changes, compare information from quarter to quarter, and take action where possible.
62
Currently, there are various approaches to report private fund performance to fund
investors, often depending on the type of private fund (e.g., the fund’s strategy, structure, target
asset class, investment horizon, or liquidity profile). Certain of these approaches may be
misleading without the benefit of well-disclosed assumptions, and others may lead to investor
confusion. For example, an adviser showing internal rate of return with the impact of fund-level

61 See Investment Adviser Marketing, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5653 (Dec. 22, 2021) (“Marketing
Release”), at section II.A.2.a.iv (noting that the definition of “advertisement” includes a communication to a
current investor that offers new or additional advisory services with regard to securities, provided that the
communication otherwise satisfies the definition of “advertisement.”).
62 The marketing rule and its specific protections would generally not apply in the context of a quarterly statement.
See Marketing Release, supra footnote 61, at sections II.A.2.a.iv and II.A.4. The compliance date for the
Marketing Rule is November 4, 2022.
57
subscription facilities could mislead investors because that method of calculation would
artificially increase performance metrics.
63 An adviser showing private fund performance as
compared to a public market equivalent (“PME”) in a case where the private fund does not have
an appropriate benchmark could mislead investors to believe that the private fund performance
will meet or exceed the performance of the PME. Certain investors may also mistakenly believe
that their private fund investment has a liquidity profile that is similar to an investment in the
PME or an index that is similar to the PME.
Without standardized performance metrics (and adequate disclosure of the criteria used
and assumptions made in calculating the performance),
64 investors cannot compare their various
private fund investments managed by the same adviser nor can they gauge the value of an
adviser’s investment management services by comparing the performance of private funds
advised by different advisers.65 Standardized performance information would help an investor
decide whether to continue to invest in the private fund, if redemption is possible, as well as
more holistically to make decisions about other components of the investor’s portfolio.
Furthermore, we believe that proposing to require advisers to show performance information
alongside fee and expense information as part of the quarterly statement would paint a more
complete picture of an investor’s private fund investment. This would particularly provide
context for investors that are paying performance-based compensation and would help investors
understand the true cost of investing in the private fund. This proposed performance reporting

63 See infra section II.A.2.b. (Performance Disclosure: Illiquid Funds).
64 Private funds can have various types of complicated structures and involve complex financing mechanisms. As
a result, an adviser may need to make certain assumptions when calculating performance for private funds,
specifically illiquid funds.
65 See David Snow, Private Equity: A Brief Overview: An introduction to the fundamentals of an expanding,
global industry, PEI Media (2007), at 11 (discussing variations on private equity performance metrics).
58
would also provide greater transparency into how private fund performance is calculated,
improving an investor’s ability to interpret performance results.66
The proposed rule recognizes the need for different performance metrics for private funds
based on certain fund characteristics, but also imposes a general framework to ensure there is
sufficient standardization in order to provide useful, comparable information to investors. An
adviser would remain free to include other performance metrics in the quarterly statement as
long as the quarterly statement presents the performance metrics prescribed by the proposed rule
and complies with the other requirements in the proposed rule. However, advisers that choose to
include additional information should consider what other rules and regulations might apply. For
example, although we would not consider information in the quarterly statement required by the
proposed rule to be an “advertisement” under the marketing rule, an adviser that offers new or
additional investment advisory services with regard to securities in the quarterly statement would
need to consider whether such information would be subject to the marketing rule.67 An adviser
would also need to consider whether performance information presented outside of the required
quarterly statement, even if it contains some of the same information as the quarterly statement,
would be subject to, and meet the requirements of, the marketing rule. Regardless, the quarterly
statement would be subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.68

66 Private fund investors increasingly request additional disclosure regarding private fund performance, including
transparency into the calculation of the performance metrics. See, e.g., GPs feel the strain as LPs push for more
transparency on portfolio performance and fee structures, Intertrust Group (July 6, 2020), available at
https://www.intertrustgroup.com/news/gps-feel-the-strain-as-lps-push-for-more-transparency-on-portfolioperformance-and-fee-structures/; ILPA Principals 3.0, at 36 “Financial and Performance Reporting” and “Fund
Marketing Materials,” available at https://ilpa.org/wp-content/flash/ILPA%20Principles%203.0/?page=36.
67 See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-1 (rule 206(4)-1). A communication to a current investor is an “advertisement” when it
offers new or additional investment advisory services with regard to securities.
68 This would include the anti-fraud provisions of section 206 of the Advisers Act, rule 206(4)-8 under the
Advisers Act, section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and section 10(b) of the Exchange Act (and 17 CFR 240.10b5 (rule 10b-5 thereunder)), to the extent relevant.
59
Liquid v. Illiquid Fund Determination
The proposed performance disclosure requirements of the quarterly statement rule would
require an adviser first to determine whether its private fund client is an illiquid or liquid fund, as
defined in the proposed rule, no later than the time the adviser sends the initial quarterly
statement.
69 The adviser would then be required to present certain performance information
depending on this categorization. The purpose of these definitions is to distinguish which of the
two particular performance reporting methods would apply and is most appropriate, resulting in a
more accurate portrayal of the fund’s returns over time and allowing for more standardized
comparisons of the performance of similar funds.
We propose to define an illiquid fund as a private fund that: (i) has a limited life; (ii)
does not continuously raise capital; (iii) is not required to redeem interests upon an investor’s
request; (iv) has as a predominant operating strategy the return of the proceeds from disposition
of investments to investors; (v) has limited opportunities, if any, for investors to withdraw before
termination of the fund; and (vi) does not routinely acquire (directly or indirectly) as part of its
investment strategy market-traded securities and derivative instruments.70 We believe these
factors are consistent with the characteristics of illiquid funds and these factors would align with
the current factors for determining how certain types of private funds should report performance
under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).71
Private funds that fall into the proposed “illiquid fund” definition are generally closedend funds that do not offer periodic redemption options, other than in exceptional circumstances,

69 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(1). The proposed rule does not require the adviser to revisit the determination
periodically; however, advisers should generally consider whether they are providing accurate information to
investors and whether they need to revisit the liquid/illiquid determination based on changes in the fund.
70 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “illiquid fund”).
71 See GAAP ASC 946-205-50-23/24.
60
such as in response to regulatory events. They also do not invest in publicly traded securities,
except for investing a de minimis amount of liquid assets. We believe that many private equity,
real estate, and venture capital funds would fall into the illiquid fund definition, and therefore,
the proposed rule would require advisers to these types of funds to provide performance metrics
that recognize their unique characteristics, such as irregular cash flows, which otherwise make
measuring performance difficult for both advisers and investors as discussed below.
We propose to define a “liquid fund” as any private fund that is not an illiquid fund.72
Private funds that fall into the “liquid fund” definition generally allow periodic investor
redemptions, such as monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually. They also primarily invest in markettraded securities, except for a de minimis amount of illiquid assets, and therefore determine their
net asset value on a regular basis. Most hedge funds would likely fall into the liquid fund
definition, and therefore, the proposed rule would require advisers to these types of funds to
provide performance metrics that show the year-over-year return using the market value of the
underlying assets. We acknowledge, however, that there could be circumstances where an
adviser would determine a hedge fund is an illiquid fund because it holds less liquid investments
or has limited investors’ ability to redeem some or all of their interests in the fund. We also
recognize that some private funds may not neatly fit into the liquid or illiquid designations. For
example, a hybrid fund is a type of private fund that can have characteristics of both liquid and
illiquid funds, and whether the fund is treated as a liquid or illiquid fund under the rule would
depend on the facts and circumstances.
In any case, the proposed rule would require advisers to provide performance reporting
for each private fund as part of the fund’s quarterly statement. The determination of whether a

72 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “liquid fund”).
61
fund is liquid or illiquid dictates the type of performance reporting that must be included and,
because it would result in funds with similar characteristics presenting the same type of
performance metrics, we believe this approach would improve comparability of private fund
performance reporting for fund investors. As indicated below, we welcome comment on
whether these definitions lead to meaningful performance reporting for different types of private
funds in light of the myriad fund strategies and structures.
We request comment on the following aspects of the proposed performance disclosure
requirement:
• Should the proposed rule require advisers to include performance information in investor
quarterly statements? Why or why not?
• Should the proposed rule require advisers to determine whether a private fund is a liquid
or illiquid fund and provide performance metrics based on that determination?
Alternatively, should the rule eliminate the definitions and give advisers discretion to
provide the proposed performance metrics that they believe most accurately portray the
fund’s returns?
• Should we define “illiquid fund” and “liquid fund” as proposed or are there alternative
definitions we should use? Are there other terms we should use for these purposes? For
example, should we refer to the types of funds that would provide annual net total returns
under the rule as “annual return funds” and those that would provide internal rates of
return (IRR) and a multiple of invested cash (MOIC) under the rule as “IRR/MOIC
funds”?
• Are the six factors used in the definition of “illiquid fund” sufficient to capture most
funds for which an annual net total return is not an appropriate measure of performance?
62
Are there any factors we should add? For example, should we add a factor regarding
whether the fund produces irregular cash flows or whether the fund takes into account
unrealized gains when calculating performance-based compensation? Should we add as a
factor whether the private fund pays carried interest? Are there factors we should
eliminate?
• Should we define additional terms or phrases used within the definition of “illiquid fund,”
such as “has as a predominant operating strategy the return of the proceeds from
disposition of investments to investors”? Would this characteristic carve out certain
funds, such as real estate funds and credit funds, for which we generally believe internal
rates of return and a multiple of invested capital are the appropriate performance
measures? If so, why? Should we eliminate or modify this characteristic in the definition
of “illiquid fund”?
• Should the proposed rule define a “liquid fund” based on certain characteristics? If so,
what characteristics? For example, should we define it as a private fund that requires
investors to contribute all, or substantially all, of their capital at the time of investment,
and invests no more than a de minimis amount of assets in illiquid investments? If so,
how should we define “illiquid investments”? Are there other characteristics relating to
redemptions, cash flows, or tax treatment that we should use to define the types of funds
that should provide annual net total return metrics?
• Will advisers be able to determine whether a private fund it manages is a liquid or illiquid
fund? For example, how would an adviser classify certain types of hybrid funds under
the proposed rule? Should the rule include a third category of funds for hybrid or other
funds? If so, what definition should we use? Should we amend the proposed definitions
63
if we adopt a third category of funds (e.g., should we revise the definition of “liquid
fund” given that the proposal defines “liquid fund” as any private fund that is not an
illiquid fund)? If a fund falls within the third category, should the rule require or permit
the private fund to provide performance metrics that most accurately portray the fund’s
returns?
• Are there scenarios in which an adviser might initially classify a fund as illiquid, but the
fund later transitions to a liquid fund (or vice versa)? Should we provide additional
flexibility in these circumstances? Should the proposed rule require advisers to revisit
periodically their determination of a fund’s liquidity status? For example, should the
proposed rule require advisers to revisit the liquid/illiquid determination annually, semiannually, or quarterly?
• How would an adviser to a private fund with an illiquid side pocket classify the private
fund under the proposed rule’s definitions for liquid and illiquid funds? For example,
would the adviser treat the entire private fund as illiquid because of the side pocket?
Why or why not? Should we permit or require the adviser to classify the side pocket as
an illiquid fund, with the remaining portion of the private fund classified as a liquid fund?
• Instead of requiring advisers to show performance with equal prominence, should the
proposed rule instead allow advisers to feature certain performance with greater
prominence than other performance as long as all of the information is included in the
quarterly statement? Why or why not?
a. Liquid Funds
The proposed rule would require advisers to liquid funds to disclose performance
information in quarterly statements for the following periods. First, an adviser to a liquid fund
64
would be required to disclose the liquid fund’s annual net total returns for each calendar year
since inception. For example, a liquid fund that commenced operations four calendar years ago
would show annual net total returns for each of the first four years since its inception.73 We
believe this information would provide fund investors with a comprehensive overview of the
fund’s performance over the life of the fund and improve an investor’s ability to compare the
fund’s performance with other similar funds. As noted above, investors can use performance
information in connection with fee and expense information to analyze the value of their private
fund investments. The proposed requirement would prevent advisers from including only recent
performance results or presenting only results or periods with strong performance. For similar
reasons, it also would require an adviser to present these various time periods with equal
prominence.
Second, the adviser would be required to show the liquid fund’s average annual net total
returns over the one-, five-, and ten- calendar year periods.74 However, if the private fund did
not exist for one of these prescribed time periods, then the adviser would not be required to
provide that information. Requiring performance over these time periods would provide
investors with standardized performance metrics that would reflect how the private fund
performed during different market or economic conditions. These time periods would provide
reference points for private fund investors, particularly when comparing two or more private
fund investments, and would provide private fund investors with aggregate performance
information that can serve as a helpful summary of the fund’s performance.

73 If a private fund’s inception date were other than on the first day of a calendar year, the private fund would
show performance for a stub period and then show calendar year performance. For example, if the four-year
period ended on October 31, 2021, and the fund’s inception date was August 31, 2017, the fund would show
full calendar year performance for 2018, 2019, and 2020, and partial year performance in 2017.
74 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(2)(i)(B).
65
Third, the adviser would be required to show the liquid fund’s cumulative net total return
for the current calendar year as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter covered by the
quarterly statement. For example, a liquid fund that has been in operations for four calendar
years (beginning on January 1) and seven months would show the cumulative net total return for
the current calendar year through the end of the second quarter. We believe this information
would provide fund investors with insight into the fund’s most recent performance, which
investors could use to assess the fund’s performance during current market conditions. This
quarterly performance information also would provide helpful context for reviewing and
monitoring the fees and expenses borne by the fund during the quarter, which the quarterly
statement would disclose.
We believe these performance metrics would allow investors to assess these funds’
performance because they ordinarily invest in market-traded securities, which are primarily
liquid. As a result, liquid funds generally are able to determine their net asset value on a regular
basis and compute the year-over-year return using the market-based value of the underlying
assets. We have taken a similar approach with regard to registered funds, which also invest a
substantial amount of their assets in primarily liquid underlying holdings (e.g., publicly traded
securities).
75 As a result, liquid funds, like registered funds, currently generally report
performance on an annual and quarterly basis. Investors in a private fund that is a liquid fund
would similarly find this information helpful. Most traditional hedge funds would likely fall into

75 See Form N-1A. This form requires registered investment companies to report to investors and file with the
SEC documents containing the fund’s annual total returns by calendar year and the highest and lowest returns
for a calendar quarter, among other performance information.
66
the liquid bucket and would need to provide disclosures regarding the underlying assumptions of
the performance (e.g., whether dividends or other distributions are reinvested).76
We request comment on the following with respect to the proposed liquid fund
performance requirement:
• Should we require advisers to provide annual net total returns for liquid funds, as
proposed? Would showing annual net total returns for each calendar year since a private
fund’s inception be overly burdensome for older funds? Would performance information
that is more than 10 years old be useful to investors? Why or why not?
• Should the proposed rule define “annual net total return” or specify the format in which
advisers must present the annual net total returns? Should the proposed rule specify how
advisers should calculate the annual net total return, similar to Form N-1A?77
• The proposed rule would require advisers to provide performance information for each
calendar year since inception and over prescribed time periods (one-, five-, and ten-year
periods). Should the proposed rule instead only require an adviser to satisfy one of these
requirements (i.e., provide performance each calendar year since inception or provide
performance over the prescribed time periods)? For funds that have not been in existence
for one of the prescribed time periods, should the proposed rule require the adviser to
show the average annual net total return since inception, instead of the prescribed time
period?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to provide average annual net total returns for
the private fund over the one-, five-, and ten- calendar year periods. However, the

76 See infra section II.A.2.c (Prominent Disclosure of Performance Calculation Information).
77 See Form N-1A, Item 26(b).
67
proposal would not prohibit advisers from providing additional information. Should we
allow advisers to provide performance information for annual periods other than calendar
years?
• Should the proposed rule define “average annual net total return” or specify the format in
which advisers must present the average annual net total returns?
• The proposed rule would require an adviser to provide “the cumulative net total return for
the current calendar year.” Instead of using the word “cumulative” net total return,
should the rule use the phrase “year to date” net total return?
• To the extent certain liquid funds quote yields rather than returns, should such funds be
required or permitted to quote yields in addition to or instead of returns?
b. Illiquid Funds
The proposed rule would require advisers to illiquid funds to disclose the following
performance measures in the quarterly statement, shown since inception of the illiquid fund and
computed without the impact of any fund-level subscription facilities:
(i) Gross internal rate of return and gross multiple of invested capital for the illiquid fund;
(ii) Net internal rate of return and net multiple of invested capital for the illiquid fund;
and
(iii) Gross internal rate of return and gross multiple of invested capital for the realized
and unrealized portions of the illiquid fund’s portfolio, with the realized and unrealized
performance shown separately.
The proposed rule also would require advisers to provide investors with a statement of
contributions and distributions for the illiquid fund.78

78 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(2)(ii).
68
Since Inception. The proposed rule would require an adviser to disclose the illiquid
fund’s performance measures since inception. This proposed requirement would prevent
advisers from including only recent performance results or presenting only results or periods
with strong performance, which could mislead investors. We propose to require this for all
illiquid fund performance measures under the proposed rule, including the measures for the
realized and unrealized portions of the illiquid fund’s portfolio.
The proposed rule would require an adviser to include performance measures for the
illiquid fund through the end of the quarter covered by the quarterly statement. We recognize,
however, that certain funds may need information from portfolio investments and other third
parties to generate performance data and thus may not have the necessary information prior to
the distribution of the quarterly statement. Accordingly, to the extent quarter-end numbers are
not available at the time of distribution of the quarterly statement, an adviser would be required
to include performance measures through the most recent practicable date, which we generally
believe would be through the end of the quarter immediately preceding the quarter covered by
the quarterly statement. The proposed rule would require the quarterly statement to reference the
date the performance information is current through (e.g., December 31, 2021).
79
Computed Without the Impact of Fund-Level Subscription Facilities. The proposed rule
would require advisers to calculate performance measures for each illiquid fund as if the private
fund called investor capital, rather than drawing down on fund-level subscription facilities.
80
Such facilities enable the fund to use loan proceeds – rather than investor capital – to initially

79 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(2)(iii).
80 As discussed below, the proposed rule would also require advisers to prominently disclose the criteria used, and
assumptions made, in calculating performance. This would include the criteria and assumptions used to prepare
an illiquid fund’s unlevered performance measures.
69
fund investments and pay expenses. This practice permits the fund to delay the calling of capital
from investors, which has the potential to increase performance metrics artificially.
Many advisers currently provide performance figures that reflect the impact of fund-level
subscription facilities. These “levered” performance figures often do not reflect the fund’s actual
performance and have the potential to mislead investors.81 For example, an investor could
reasonably believe that levered performance results are similar to those that the investor has
achieved from its investment in the fund. We believe that unlevered performance figures would
provide investors with more meaningful data and improve the comparability of returns.
We propose to define “fund-level subscription facilities” as any subscription facilities,
subscription line financing, capital call facilities, capital commitment facilities, bridge lines, or
other indebtedness incurred by the private fund that is secured by the unfunded capital
commitments of the private fund’s investors.82 This definition is designed to capture the various
types of subscription facilities prevalent in the market that serve as temporary replacements or
substitutes for investor capital.
83
We would generally interpret the phrase computed without the impact of fund-level
subscription facilities to require advisers to exclude fees and expenses associated with the

81 We recognize that fund-level subscription facilities can be an important cash management tool for both advisers
and investors. For example, a fund may use a subscription facility to reduce the overall number of capital calls
and to enhance its ability to execute deals quickly and efficiently.
82 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1. The proposed rule defines “unfunded capital commitments” as committed capital
that has not yet been contributed to the private fund by investors, and “committed capital” as any commitment
pursuant to which a person is obligated to acquire an interest in, or make capital contributions to, the private
fund. See id.
83 We recognize that a private fund may guarantee portfolio investment indebtedness. In such a situation, if the
portfolio investment does not have sufficient cash flow to pay its debt obligations, the fund may be required to
cover the shortfall to satisfy its guarantee. Even though investors’ unfunded commitments may indirectly
support the fund’s guarantee, the proposed definition would not cover such fund guarantees. Unlike fund-level
subscription facilities, such guarantees generally are not put in place to enable the fund to delay the calling of
investor capital.
70
subscription facility, such as the interest expense, when calculating net performance figures and
preparing the statement of contributions and distributions. This approach would cause the net
returns for many funds to be higher than would be the case if such amounts were included. We
believe that this approach is appropriate, however, because it is consistent with the policy goal of
this aspect of the proposed rule (i.e., requiring advisers to show private fund investors the returns
the fund would have achieved if there were no subscription facility).
84 We request comment
below on whether this approach is appropriate.
Fund-Level Performance. The proposed rule would require an adviser to disclose an
illiquid fund’s gross and net internal rate of return and gross and net multiple of invested capital
for the illiquid fund. The proposed rule also would require an adviser to provide a statement of
contributions and distributions for the illiquid fund reflecting the aggregate cash inflows from
investors and the aggregate cash outflows from the fund to investors, along with the fund’s net
asset value.
We recognize that illiquid funds have unique characteristics, such as irregular cash flows,
that make measuring performance difficult for both advisers and investors. We also recognize
that internal rate of return and multiple of invested capital, each as discussed below, have their
drawbacks as performance metrics.
85 We believe, however, that these metrics, combined with a
statement of contributions and distributions reflecting cash flows, would help investors
holistically understand the fund’s performance, allow investors to diligence the fund’s
performance, and calculate other performance metrics they may find helpful. When presented in

84 The proposed rule nevertheless would require advisers to reflect the fees and expenses associated with the
subscription facility in the quarterly statement’s fee and expense table.
85 For example, multiple of invested capital does not factor in the amount of the time it takes for a fund to generate
a return, and internal rate of return assumes early distributions will be reinvested at the same rate of return
generated at the initial exit.
71
accordance with the conditions and other disclosures required under the proposed rule, such
standardized reporting measures would provide meaningful performance information for
investors, allowing them to compare returns among funds and also to make more-informed
decisions.
We propose to define “internal rate of return” as the discount rate that causes the net
present value of all cash flows throughout the life of the private fund to be equal to zero.86 Cash
flows would be represented by capital contributions (i.e., cash inflows) and fund distributions
(i.e., cash outflows), and the unrealized value of the fund would be represented by a fund
distribution (i.e., a cash outflow). This definition would provide investors with a time-adjusted
return that takes into account the size and timing of a fund’s cash flows and its unrealized value
at the time of calculation.87
We propose to define “multiple of invested capital” as (i) the sum of: (A) the unrealized
value of the illiquid fund; and (B) the value of all distributions made by the illiquid fund; (ii)
divided by the total capital contributed to the illiquid fund by its investors.88 This definition is
intended to provide investors with a measure of the fund’s aggregate value (i.e., the sum of
clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B)) relative to the capital invested (i.e., clause (ii)) as of the end of the
applicable reporting period. Unlike the definition of internal rate of return, the multiple of
invested capital definition would not take into account the amount of time it takes for a fund to

86 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “gross IRR” and “net IRR”).
87 When calculating a fund’s internal rate of return, an adviser would need to take into account the specific date a
cash flow occurred (or is deemed to occur). Certain electronic spreadsheet programs have “XIRR” or other
similar formulas that require the user to input the applicable dates. The proposed requirement that an illiquid
fund present its performance using an internal rate of return aligns with the U.S. GAAP criteria used to
determine when a private fund must present performance using an internal rate of return in its audited financial
statements. See U.S. GAAP ASC 946-205-50-23/24.
88 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “gross MOIC” and “net MOIC”).
72
generate a return (meaning that the multiple of invested capital measure would focus on “how
much” rather than “when”).
We believe that the proposed definitions of internal rate of return and multiple of invested
capital are generally consistent with how the industry currently calculates such performance
metrics. For example, most advisers use electronic spreadsheet programs to calculate a fund’s
internal rate of return. Such programs typically calculate the internal rate of return as the interest
rate for an investment consisting of payments (cash outflows) and income (cash inflows)
received over a period.89 However, we have observed certain advisers deviate from standard
formulas, or make various assumptions, when calculating a private fund’s performance.
Accordingly, we believe that prescribing definitions would decrease the risk of different advisers
presenting internal rate of return and multiple of invested capital performance figures that are not
comparable. Both definitions are designed to limit any deviations in calculating the standardized
performance prescribed by the proposed rule. We believe that this approach is appropriate
because it would provide a degree of standardization and provide investors with the relevant
information to compare performance.
An adviser would be required to present each performance metric on a gross and net
basis.90 Under the proposed rule, an illiquid fund’s gross performance would not reflect the
deduction of fees, expenses, and performance-based compensation borne by the private fund.91
We believe that presenting both gross and net performance measures for the illiquid fund would

89 See, e.g., IRR Function, available at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/irr-function-64925eaa-9988-
495b-b290-3ad0c163c1bc (noting that the internal rate of return is closely related to net present value and that
the rate of return calculated by the internal rate of return is the interest rate corresponding to a zero net present
value).
90 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(2)(ii).
91 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “gross IRR,” “net IRR,” “gross MOIC,” and “net MOIC”).
73
prevent investors from being misled. We believe that gross performance would provide insight
into the profitability of underlying investments selected by the adviser. Solely presenting gross
performance, however, may imply that investors have received the full amount of such returns.
The net performance would assist investors in understanding the actual returns received and,
when presented alongside gross performance, the negative effect fees, expenses, and
performance-based compensation have had on past performance.
The proposed rule also would require an adviser to provide a statement of contributions
and distributions for the illiquid fund. We believe this would provide private fund investors with
important information regarding the fund’s performance because it would reflect the underlying
data used by the adviser to generate the fund’s returns, which, in many cases, is not currently
provided to private fund investors. Such data would allow investors to diligence the various
performance measures presented in the quarterly statement. In addition, this data would allow
the investors to calculate additional performance measures based on their own preferences.
We propose to define statement of contributions and distributions as a document that
presents:
(i) All capital inflows the private fund has received from investors and all capital
outflows the private fund has distributed to investors since the private fund’s inception, with the
value and date of each inflow and outflow; and
(ii) The net asset value of the private fund as of the end of the reporting period covered
by the quarterly statement.
92
For similar reasons to those discussed above, the proposed rule would require an adviser
to prepare the statement of contributions and distributions without the impact of any fund-level

92 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1.
74
subscription facilities. This would require an adviser to assume the private fund called investor
capital, rather than drawing down on fund-level subscription facilities. To avoid double counting
capital inflows, the amount borrowed under the subscription facility generally should be
reflected as a capital inflow from investors and an equal dollar amount of actual capital inflows
from investors generally should not be reflected on the statement.
Realized and Unrealized Performance. The proposed rule also would require an adviser
to disclose a gross internal rate of return and gross multiple of invested capital for the realized
and unrealized portions of the illiquid fund’s portfolio, with the realized and unrealized
performance shown separately.
The value of the unrealized portion of an illiquid fund’s portfolio typically is determined
by the adviser and, given the lack of readily available market values, can be challenging. For
example, an adviser’s valuation policies and procedures for illiquid investments may rely on
models and unobservable inputs. This creates a conflict of interest because the adviser is
typically evaluated and, in certain cases, compensated based on the fund’s unrealized
performance. Further, investors often decide whether to invest in a successor fund based on the
predecessor fund’s performance. These factors create an incentive for the adviser to inflate the
value of the unrealized portion of the illiquid fund’s portfolio. We believe highlighting the
performance of the fund’s unrealized investments would assist investors in determining whether
the aggregate, fund-level performance measures present an overly optimistic view of the fund’s
overall performance. For example, if the performance of the unrealized portion of the fund’s
portfolio is significantly higher than the performance of the realized portion, it may imply that
the adviser’s valuations are overly optimistic or otherwise do not reflect the values that can be
realized in a transaction or sale with an independent third party.
75
The proposed rule would only require an adviser to disclose gross performance measures
for the realized and unrealized portions of the illiquid fund’s portfolio. We believe that
calculating net figures could involve complex and potentially subjective assumptions regarding
the allocation of fund-level fees, expenses, and adviser compensation between the realized and
unrealized portions of the portfolio.
93 In our view, such assumptions would likely diminish the
benefits net performance measures would provide.
We request comment on the following with respect to the proposed illiquid fund
performance requirement:
• Are the proposed performance metrics appropriate? Why or why not? We recognize that
advisers often utilize different performance metrics for different funds. Should we add
any other metrics to the proposed rule? For example, should we require a public market
equivalent or variations of internal rate of return, such as a modified internal rate of
return that assumes cash flows are reinvested at modest rates of return or otherwise
incorporates a cost of capital concept for funds that do not draw down all, or substantially
all, of investor capital at the time of investment? If so, should we prescribe a benchmark
for the cost of capital and reinvestment rates?
• The proposed rule would not distinguish among different types of illiquid funds. Is our
approach in this respect appropriate or should we treat certain illiquid funds differently?
If so, how should we reflect that treatment?
• Are there additional guardrails we should add to the proposed rule to achieve the policy
goal of providing investors with comparable performance information? If so, please

93 For example, an adviser would have to determine how to allocate fund organizational expenses between the
realized and unrealized portions of the portfolio.
76
explain. Are there practices that advisers use or assumptions that advisers make, when
calculating performance that we should require, curtail, or otherwise require advisers to
disclose?
• Although some investors receive certain annual performance information about a private
fund if that fund is audited and distributes financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, we believe that the proposed rule’s performance information would be
helpful for private fund investors because it would require performance information to be
reported at more frequent intervals in a standardized manner. Do commenters agree? To
the extent there are differences (e.g., the requirement that performance be computed
without the impact of any fund-level subscription facilities), would investors find this
confusing? Would disclosure regarding these differences help to alleviate investor
confusion?
• Would investor confusion or other concerns arise from requiring performance
information in the quarterly statement as proposed?
• What, if any, burdens would be associated with this aspect of the proposed rule? How
can we minimize any associated burdens while still achieving our goals?
• Are the proposed definitions appropriate and clear? If not, how should we clarify the
definitions? Should we modify or eliminate any? Would additional definitions be
appropriate or useful? For example, should we define any of the terms used in the
definition of internal rate of return, such as “net present value” or “discount rate”? If so,
what definitions should we use?
• Are the definitions of gross IRR, gross MOIC, net IRR, and net MOIC appropriate?
Should we provide further guidance or specify requirements in the proposed rule on how
77
to calculate gross performance or net performance? If so, what guidance or
requirements? Should we require advisers to adopt policies and procedures prescribing
specific methodologies for calculating gross performance and net performance? Why or
why not? When calculating net performance, are there additional fees and expenses that
advisers should include? Alternatively, should we expressly permit advisers to exclude
certain fees and expenses when calculating net performance figures, such as taxes
incurred to accommodate certain, but not all, investor preferences? Why or why not?
• Similarly, are the definitions of gross IRR and gross MOIC appropriate for purposes of
calculating the performance metrics of the realized and unrealized portions of the illiquid
fund’s portfolio? Should we modify such definitions to reference specifically the realized
and unrealized portions of the portfolio, rather than only referencing the illiquid fund?
For example, should the definition of MOIC be revised to mean, as of the end of the
applicable calendar quarter: (i) the sum of (A) the unrealized value of applicable portion
of the illiquid fund’s portfolio, and (b) the value of all distributions made by the illiquid
fund attributable to the applicable portion of the illiquid fund’s portfolio; (ii) divided by
the total capital contributed to the illiquid fund by its investors attributable to the
applicable portion of the illiquid fund’s portfolio? Are there other variations we should
impose? Why or why not?
• The Global Investment Performance Standards (“GIPS”) are a set of voluntary standards
for calculating and presenting investment performance. For purposes of calculating an
illiquid fund’s performance under the proposed rule, are there any elements found in the
GIPS standards that we should require? For example, should we require advisers to
78
disclose composite cumulative committed capital,
94 or should we require advisers to
disclose performance with and without the impact of subscription facilities? Are there
any definitions we should revise or propose to be consistent with the definitions used in
the GIPS standards? For example, the GIPS standards define “internal rate of return” as
the return for a period that reflects the change in value and the timing and size of external
cash flows and “multiple of invested capital” as the total value divided by since inception
paid-in capital.95 If we were to adopt such definitions, do commenters believe that such
definitions would result in different performance numbers for illiquid funds, as compared
to the performance numbers that advisers would disclose under the proposed definitions?
Why or why not? Please provide examples.
• We recognize that advisers and their related persons typically invest in private funds on a
“fee-free, carry-free” basis (i.e., they are not required to pay management fees or
performance-based compensation). When calculating a fund’s performance, how should
such interests be taken into account? Should we require advisers to exclude such
interests from the calculations, especially the net performance figures?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to calculate the various performance measures
without the impact of any fund-level subscription facilities. Do commenters agree with
this approach? Should the proposed rule require advisers to provide the same
performance measures with the impact of fund-level subscription facilities? Why or why

94 The GIPS standards define “committed capital” as pledges of capital to an investment vehicle by investors
(limited partners and the general partner) or the firm. The term “composite” is defined as an aggregation of one
or more portfolios that are managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The term
cumulative is not defined in the GIPS standards. Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) For Firms:
Glossary, CFA Institute (2020), available at https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/code/gips/2020-
gips-standards-firms.pdf.
95 Internal rate of return is referred to as money-weighted return in the GIPS standards, and multiple of invested
capital is referred to as investment multiple.
79
not? The proposed rule does not prohibit advisers from providing the same performance
measures with the impact of fund-level subscription facilities. Should we prohibit
advisers from doing so?
• Should we define the term “computed without the impact of any fund-level subscription
facilities”? Should we provide additional guidance or requirements regarding how
advisers generally should or must calculate such performance measures? If so, what
guidance or requirements should we provide?
• We recognize that a fund-level subscription facility has the potential to have a greater
impact on a fund’s internal rate of return as compared to its multiple of invested capital.
Should advisers only be required to provide “unlevered” internal rates of return and not
“unlevered” multiples of invested capital? If the fund realizes an investment prior to
calling any capital from investors in respect of such investment, how would an adviser
calculate a multiple for such investment?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to prepare the statement of contributions and
distributions without the impact of any fund-level subscription facilities. Would this
information be helpful for investors? Would advisers be able to prepare such a statement
without making arbitrary assumptions? Why or why not? For example, would advisers
need to make assumptions in calculating the preferred return (if applicable)?
• The proposed rule would require only gross performance measures for the realized and
unrealized portion of the illiquid fund’s portfolio. Should the proposed rule require net
performance information as well? Would net performance measures be beneficial for
investors despite the drawbacks discussed above? What assumptions should we require
80
in calculating net information? What limitations, if any, would advisers face in providing
net performance measures?
• Should we define the phrases “unrealized portion of the illiquid fund’s portfolio” and
“realized portion of the illiquid fund’s portfolio”? For example, should we define the
realized portion to include not only completely realized investments but also substantially
realized investments to the extent the fund’s remaining interest is de minimis? Why or
why not?
• Should we require advisers to disclose the dollar amounts of the realized and unrealized
portions of the portfolio? Should we also require advisers to disclose such amounts as
percentages? For example, if the value of the realized portion of the portfolio is $250
million and the value of the unrealized portion is $750 million, should we require
advisers to disclose those amounts, both as dollar values and percentages (i.e., 25% ($250
million) of the illiquid fund’s portfolio is realized, and 75% ($750 million) remains
unrealized)?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to provide cumulative performance reporting
since inception of the illiquid fund each quarter. Is this the right approach? Should the
proposed rule require performance since inception for each quarter or on an annual basis?
Should the proposed rule remove the “since inception” requirement for quarterly reports
and instead require performance for each quarter of the current year, and cumulative
performance for the current year? If so, why or why not?
• Should we prescribe specific periods for illiquid fund performance reporting? For
example, should we prescribe one-, five-, and/or ten-year time periods? Instead, should
we require that advisers always present performance since inception as proposed? Are
81
there other periods for which we should require the presentation of performance results?
Are there any specific compliance issues that an adviser would face in generating and
presenting performance results for the required period? For example, would advisers
have the requisite information to generate or support performance figures for older funds
from the proposed recordkeeping requirements and/or performance presentation
requirements? If not, should we provide an exemption for advisers that lack such
information?
• Liquid funds often have longer terms than illiquid funds. To the extent an illiquid fund
has been in existence for an extended period of time, such as more than ten years, should
the rule prescribe specific periods for performance reporting for such funds (e.g., one-,
five-, and/or ten-year time periods)?
• Should we require that advisers provide performance results current through the end of
the quarter covered by the quarterly statement as proposed? In circumstances where
quarter-end numbers are not available at the time of distribution of the quarterly
statement, should we require an adviser to include performance measures through the
most recent practicable date as proposed? Should we define, or provide additional
guidance about, the term “most recent practicable date”? If so, what definition or
additional guidance should we provide?
• Should the proposed rule require advisers to make certain, standard disclosures tailored to
each of the performance metrics mandated in the proposed rule? For example, should we
require advisers to illiquid funds that are required to display internal rate of return to
disclose prominently that the returns do not represent returns on the investor’s capital
commitment and instead only reflect returns on the investor’s contributed capital?
82
Should we require advisers to disclose that an investor’s actual return on its capital
commitment will depend on how the investor invests its uncalled commitments?
• As noted above, we would generally interpret the phrase computed without the impact of
fund-level subscription facilities to require advisers to exclude fees and expenses
associated with the subscription facility, such as the interest expense, when calculating
net performance figures and preparing the statement of contributions and distributions.
Do commenters agree with this approach? Should we require advisers to include such
amounts instead? Are there other assumptions advisers would need to make in
calculating performance information that the rule should address?
• The proposed rule would require the statement of contributions and distributions to
reflect the private fund’s net asset value as of the end of the applicable quarter. Should
we require advisers to provide additional detail regarding the unrealized value of the
private fund? For example, should we require advisers to reflect the portion of such net
asset value that would be required to be paid to the adviser as performance-based
compensation assuming a hypothetical liquidation of the fund?
• The statement of contributions and distributions generally reflects aggregate, fund-level
numbers. Should we also require a statement of contributions and distributions for each
underlying investment? Would a statement of each investment’s cash flows be useful to
investors? Why or why not? Would such a requirement be too burdensome for certain
advisers, especially advisers to private funds that have a significant number of
investments? Should this requirement only apply to certain types of funds, such as
private equity, venture capital, or other similar funds that may invest in operating
companies?
83
• Should we provide further guidance or specify requirements on how advisers generally
should or must present performance? For example, should we require advisers to present
the various performance metrics with equal prominence as proposed? Should we require
advisers to present performance information in a format designed to facilitate
comparison? Should we provide additional guidance or requirements regarding how an
adviser should or must calculate the proposed performance metrics? Is there additional
information that we should require advisers to disclose when presenting performance?
• Should we provide further guidance or specify requirements in the rule on how advisers
generally should or must treat taxes for purposes of calculating performance? For
example, should the rule state that advisers may exclude taxes paid or withheld with
respect to a particular investor or by a blocker corporation (but not the illiquid fund as a
whole)?
c. Prominent Disclosure of Performance Calculation Information
The proposed rule would require advisers to include prominent disclosure of the criteria
used and assumptions made in calculating the performance. Information about the criteria used
and assumptions made would enable the private fund investor to understand how the
performance was calculated and help provide useful context for the presented performance
metrics. Additionally, while the proposed rule includes detailed information about the type of
performance an adviser must present for liquid and illiquid funds, it is still possible that advisers
would make certain assumptions or rely on specific criteria that the proposed rule’s requirements
do not address specifically.
For example, the proposed rule would require an adviser to display, for a liquid fund, the
annual returns for each calendar year since the fund’s inception. If the adviser made any
84
assumptions in performing that calculation, such as whether dividends were reinvested, the
adviser should disclose those assumptions in the quarterly statement. As another example, for an
illiquid fund, the proposed rule would require an adviser to display the net internal rate of return
and net multiple of invested capital. In this case, the adviser should disclose the assumed fee
rates, including whether the adviser is using fee rates set forth in the fund documents, whether it
is using a blended rate or weighted average that would factor in any discounts, or whether it is
using a different method for calculating net performance. The proposed rule requires the
disclosure to be within the quarterly statement.
96 Thus, an adviser may not provide the
information only in a separate document, website hyperlink or QR code, or other separate
disclosure.
97 We believe that this information is integral to the quarterly statement because it
would enable the investor to understand and analyze the performance information better and
better compare the performance of funds and advisers without having to access other ancillary
documents. As a result, investors should receive it as part of the quarterly statement itself.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposal:
• Should we require advisers to disclose the criteria used and assumptions made in
calculating the performance as part of the quarterly statement as proposed? Is this
approach too flexible? Should we instead prescribe required disclosures?
• Should we require advisers to provide these disclosures prominently as proposed? Is
there another disclosure standard we should use for these purposes?
• Because we propose to require an adviser to provide these disclosures as part of each
quarterly statement, investors would receive these disclosures quarterly. Would

96 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(e)(2)(iii).
97 See also Marketing Release, supra at footnote 61 (discussing clear and prominent disclosures in the context of
advertisements).
85
providing these disclosures every quarter reduce their salience? Should we require these
disclosures only as part of the first quarterly statement that an adviser sends to an investor
with amendments if the criteria used or assumptions made in calculating performance
change? Should we permit hyperlinking to these disclosures after the initial quarterly
statement?
3. Preparation and Distribution of Quarterly Statements
The proposed rule would require quarterly statements to be prepared and distributed to
fund investors within 45 days after each calendar quarter end. We believe quarterly statements
would provide fund investors with timely and regular statements that contain meaningful and
comprehensive information. We understand that most private fund advisers currently provide
investors with quarterly reporting.98
For a newly formed private fund, the proposed rule would require a quarterly statement to
be prepared and distributed beginning after the fund’s second full calendar quarter of generating
operating results. Many private funds may not have performance information that is readily
available within the first several months of operations. For example, a private equity fund might
not begin investing until several months after the fund’s formation because the adviser is still
identifying investments that align with the fund’s strategy. As another example, a hedge fund
may hold initial investor capital in cash or cash equivalents, prior to commencing the fund’s
investment strategy. Accordingly, we believe that the proposed requirements for newly formed
funds would help ensure that investors receive comprehensive information about the adviser

98 See also ILPA Fee Reporting Template Guidance, Version 1.1 (Oct. 2016), at 6 (stating that “ILPA
recommends that the Template is provided on a quarterly basis within a reasonable timeframe after the release
of standard reports.”).

during the early stage of the fund’s life. The reporting period for the final quarterly statement
would cover the calendar quarter in which the fund is wound up and dissolved.
We propose to require quarterly statements to be distributed within 45 days after the
calendar quarter end. Based on our experience, we believe advisers generally would be in a
position to prepare and deliver quarterly statements within this period.
An adviser generally would satisfy the proposed requirement to “distribute” the quarterly
statements when the statements are sent to all investors in the private fund.99 However, the
proposed rule would preclude advisers from using layers of pooled investment vehicles in a
control relationship with the adviser to avoid meaningful application of the distribution
requirement. Advisers to private funds may from time to time establish special purpose vehicles
(“SPVs”) or other pooled vehicles for a variety of reasons, including facilitating investments by
one or more private funds that the advisers manage. In circumstances where an investor is itself
a pooled vehicle that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the adviser or
its related persons (a “control relationship”), the adviser must look through that pool (and any
pools in a control relationship with the adviser or its related persons, such as in a master-feeder
fund structure), in order to send to investors in those pools. Without such a requirement, the
adviser would be essentially delivering the quarterly statement to itself rather than to the parties
the quarterly statement is designed to inform.100 Outside of a control relationship, such as if the

99 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “distribute”). For purposes of the proposed rules, any “in writing”
requirement could be satisfied either through paper or electronic means consistent with existing Commission
guidance on electronic delivery of documents. See Marketing Release, supra footnote 61, at n.346. If any
distribution is made electronically for purposes of these proposed rules, it should be done in accordance with the
Commission’s guidance regarding electronic delivery. See Use of Electronic Media by Broker Dealers,
Transfer Agents, and Investment Advisers for Delivery of Information; Additional Examples Under the
Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Investment Company Act of 1940, Release No. 34-
37182 (May 9, 1996) [61 FR 24644 (May 15, 1996)].
100 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “control”).
87
private fund investor is an unaffiliated fund of funds, this same concern is not present, and the
adviser would not need to look through the structure to make meaningful delivery. The adviser
would just distribute the quarterly statement to the adviser or other designated party of the
unaffiliated fund of funds. We believe that this approach would lead to meaningful delivery of
the quarterly statement to the private fund’s investors.
We request comment on the quarterly statement preparation and distribution requirement
of the proposed rule:
• Should we require advisers to prepare and distribute statements to clients at least
quarterly, or should we prescribe a different frequency? For example, should we require
monthly, semi-annual, or annual statements? Should we mandate the same delivery
frequency for all proposed statements under the rule? How would each of these
approaches affect comparability and effectiveness of the information in those statements?
Would a quarterly reporting obligation require advisers to value the fund’s investments
more frequently than advisers currently do?
• We understand that advisers may use a fund administrator or another person to distribute
the quarterly statement. Is the proposed definition of “distribute” broad enough to
capture a fund administrator or another person acting under the direction and control of
the adviser sending the quarterly statement on the adviser’s behalf? If not, should we
broaden the definition? Instead of changing the definition of “distribute,” should we
require the adviser to distribute the quarterly statement, unless it has reason to believe
that another person has distributed a required statement (and has a copy of each such
statement distributed by such other person)?
88
• The proposed rule would require advisers to distribute the quarterly statement within 45
days of a calendar quarter end. Is this period too long or too short for an adviser to
prepare the quarterly statement while also ensuring timely delivery to investors? Should
we instead adopt a flexible delivery standard, such as a requirement that the adviser
distribute the quarterly statement “promptly”? Why or why not? If we were to adopt a
prompt delivery standard, should we define “promptly”? If so, how? If we should not
define “promptly,” should we instead interpret that term to mean as soon as reasonably
practicable?
• We understand that preparing quarterly statements may require coordination with, and
reliance on, third parties. This may be the case, for example, when a private fund itself
invests in other private funds or portfolio companies. Should the rule allow different
distribution timelines for different types of private funds (e.g., fund of funds, master
feeder funds)? If so, why (e.g., do certain types of funds value assets more frequently
than other types)? Should the proposed rule allow different distribution deadlines for
underlying funds, depending on whether or not the underlying funds have the same
adviser or an adviser that is a related person of the adviser distributing the quarterly
statements?
• Should the proposed rule bifurcate the timing of when certain information in the quarterly
statement is required? For example, should the proposed rule require fee and expense
information starting at the fund’s inception and then require performance information
beginning later? If so, when should we require an adviser to start showing performance?
• Should the proposed rule treat liquid and illiquid funds differently with regard to fee and
expense versus performance reporting? For example, should the proposed rule require
89
liquid funds to start distributing quarterly statements with performance reporting sooner
than illiquid funds? If so, why and how much sooner?
• As proposed, the rule would use “operating results” as the trigger for quarterly statement
distribution. Should we instead rely on another trigger to indicate when an adviser must
start distributing quarterly statements to investors? For example, should the proposed
rule instead require an adviser to start distributing quarterly statements when the private
fund has financial statements that report operating results? If so, why? Should we define
“operating results” or clarify what it means?
• Should the proposed rule require an adviser to prepare and distribute an initial quarterly
statement sooner than after the first two full calendar quarters of operating results? For
example, should we require an adviser to prepare and distribute a quarterly statement
after the first calendar quarter of the fund’s operations? Why or why not? If we required
an adviser to prepare and distribute a quarterly statement earlier in the fund’s life, would
this information be useful to investors?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to prepare and distribute a quarterly statement
after the private fund has two full calendar quarters of operating results and continuously
each calendar quarter thereafter. An adviser would be required to provide information for
any stub periods that precede its first two full calendar quarters of operating results (i.e.,
from the date of the fund’s inception to the beginning of the first calendar quarter during
which the fund begins to produce operating results). Should the proposed rule explicitly
address how advisers should handle stub periods? If so, how?
90
• The proposed rule would require fee and expense reporting based on a fund’s calendar
quarter and performance reporting based on a liquid fund’s calendar year. Should we
instead use “fiscal quarter” and “fiscal year”? Why or why not?
• Are there certain types of advisers or funds that should be exempt from distributing the
quarterly statement to investors? If so, which ones and why? Are there certain types of
advisers or funds that should be required to distribute quarterly statements to investors?
If so, which ones and why?
• Instead of requiring advisers to distribute the quarterly statement to investors, should we
require advisers to only distribute or make the quarterly statement available to investors
upon request? Despite the limitations of private fund governance mechanisms, as
discussed above, should we require advisers to distribute the quarterly statement to
independent members of the fund’s LPAC, board, or other similar governance body?
• Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act (the “custody rule”) allows a client to designate an
independent representative to receive on its behalf account statements and notices that are
required by that rule.101 Under the custody rule, an “independent representative” is
defined as someone who does not control, is not controlled by, and is not under common
control with the adviser, among other requirements.102 Should we adopt a similar
provision in the quarterly statement rule? Are there specific types of investors that need,
or at present commonly designate, independent representatives to receive quarterly
statements on their behalf?

101 See rule 206(4)-2(a)(7) under the Advisers Act.
102 See rule 206(4)-2(d)(4) under the Advisers Act.
91
• Should we revise the definition of “distribute” expressly to include distribution by
granting investors access to a virtual data room containing the quarterly statement? Why
or why not?
• We considered requiring the proposed quarterly statement disclosures to be submitted
using a structured, machine-readable data language. Such format may facilitate
comparisons of quarterly statement disclosures across advisers and periods. Should we
require advisers to provide quarterly statements in a machine-readable data language,
such as Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“Inline XBRL”)? Why or why
not? Would such a requirement make the quarterly statements, and the information
included therein, easier for investors to analyze? For example, would it be useful for
investors to download quarterly statement information directly into spreadsheets,
particularly for institutional investors that may have a significant number of private fund
investments? Would a machine-readable data language impose undue additional costs
and burdens on advisers? Please provide support for your response, including, where
available, cost data.
• If we adopt rules requiring a machine-readable data language, is the Inline XBRL
standard the one that we should use? Are any other standards becoming more widely
used or otherwise superior to Inline XBRL? What would the advantages of any such
other standards be over Inline XBRL?
4. Consolidated Reporting for Certain Fund Structures
An adviser may form multiple funds to implement a single strategy. For example, an
adviser may form a parallel fund for certain tax-sensitive investors, such as non-U.S. investors
that prefer to invest through an entity taxed as a corporation – rather than a partnership – for U.S.
92
Federal income tax purposes, that invests alongside the main fund in all, or substantially all, of
its investments. An adviser may also form a feeder fund for tax-sensitive investors that invests
all, or substantially all, of its capital into the main fund. Advisers often seek to structure the
funds in a way that accommodates investor preferences.
In some of these circumstances, we believe that consolidated reporting of the cost and
performance information by all private funds in the structure would provide a more complete and
accurate picture of the fees and expenses borne and performance achieved than reporting by each
private fund separately. Due to the complexity of private fund structures, however, we believe a
principles-based approach to the funds that must provide consolidated reporting is necessary.
Accordingly, the proposed rule would require advisers to consolidate reporting for substantially
similar pools of assets to the extent doing so would provide more meaningful information to the
private fund’s investors and would not be misleading.
103
For example, certain private funds utilize master-feeder structures. Typically, investors
invest in onshore and offshore feeder funds, which, in turn, invest all, or substantially all, of their
investable capital in a single master fund. The same adviser typically advises and controls all
three funds, and the master fund typically makes and holds the investments. Because the feeder
funds are conduits for investors to gain exposure to the master fund and its investments, the
proposed rule would require the adviser to provide feeder fund investors with a single quarterly
statement covering the applicable feeder fund and the feeder fund’s proportionate interest in the
master fund on a consolidated basis, so long as the consolidated statement would provide more
meaningful information to investors and would not be misleading.

103 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(f). See also infra Section II.E.
93
We request comment on the proposed consolidated reporting provision of the proposed
rule:
• Do commenters agree that the proposed rule should require advisers to consolidate
reporting to cover related funds to the extent doing so would provide more meaningful
information to investors and would not be misleading? Alternatively, should we prohibit
advisers from consolidating information for multiple funds? Why or why not? Should
the rule permit, rather than require, consolidated reporting?
• Should we require advisers to provide a consolidated quarterly statement for funds that
are part of the same strategy, such as parallel funds, feeder funds, and master funds?
Alternatively, should these types of funds have separate reporting? For example, should
feeder fund investors receive a quarterly statement covering the feeder fund and a
separate quarterly statement covering the main fund or master fund? How should the rule
address the fact that certain funds may have different expenses (e.g., an offshore fund
may have director expenses while an onshore fund may not)? Should we require advisers
to provide investors with a summary of any fund-specific expenses and the corresponding
dollar amount(s)? Should such a requirement be triggered only if the fund-specific
expense exceeds a certain threshold, such as a percentage of the fund size (e.g., .01%,
.05%, or .10% of the fund’s size) or a specific dollar amount (e.g., $15,000, $30,000, or
$50,000)?
• As noted above, the proposal would require advisers to provide feeder fund investors
with a consolidated quarterly statement covering the applicable feeder fund and the
feeder fund’s proportionate interest in the master fund, to the extent doing so would
provide more meaningful information to investors and would not be misleading. Do
94
commenters agree with this approach? Alternatively, should we require advisers to
provide consolidated reporting covering all feeder funds (and not just the applicable
feeder fund) and the master fund? Why or why not?
• We also recognize that certain private funds have multiple classes (or other groupings
such as series or tranches) of interests or shares. The proposed rule would require the
quarterly statement to present fund-wide information. Would advisers face challenges in
calculating fee, expense, and performance information if there are differences in fees,
allocations, and/or expenses between or among classes, series, or tranches? Should we
require disclosure of class-specific fees and expenses, or of the differences among
classes? Why or why not? Should we instead permit or require quarterly statements for
multi-class private funds to present the proposed fee and expense and performance
information on a class-by-class basis, particularly if each class (or series or tranche) is
considered a distinct private fund or separate legal entity (with segregated assets and
liabilities) under applicable law? Would such an approach provide more meaningful
information for investors in each of those classes, given the potential for different fee,
allocation, and expense structures? Should we require quarterly statements for multiclass (or multi-series or multi-tranche) private funds to present class-by-class (or seriesby-series or tranche-by-tranche) information to the extent each class (or series or tranche)
holds different investments?
• Should advisers only be required to distribute a class’ quarterly statement to interest
holders of such class, or should all fund investors be entitled to receive such statement
regardless of whether they are interest holders of the relevant class if the rule permits or
requires class-specific quarterly statements for multi-class private funds?
95
• Certain advisers provide combined financial statements covering multiple funds. Should
we require or permit advisers to provide consolidated quarterly statements for funds that
have combined financial statements? Why or why not?
5. Format and Content Requirements
The proposed rule would require the adviser to use clear, concise, plain English in the
quarterly statement.
104 For example, an adviser would not satisfy the proposed requirement for
“clear” disclosures unless those disclosures are made in a font size and type that is legible, and
margins and paper size (if applicable) are reasonable. Likewise, to meet this standard, any
information that an adviser chooses to include in a quarterly statement, but that is not required by
the rule, would be required to be as short as practicable, not more prominent than the required
information, and not obscure or impede an investor’s understanding of the mandatory
information.
In addition, the proposed rule would require an adviser to present information in the
quarterly statement in a format that facilitates review from one quarterly statement to the next.
As noted above, the quarterly statement is designed to allow an investor to monitor and assess
the costs and performance of the fund over time. We anticipate that, quarter-over-quarter, an
adviser would use a consistent format for a fund’s quarterly statements, thus allowing an investor
to easily compare fees, expenses, and performance over each quarterly period. We also
encourage advisers to use a structured, machine-readable format if advisers believe this format
would be useful to the investors in their fund.

104 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(g).
96
The proposed format and content requirements would apply to all aspects of a quarterly
statement, including the proposed requirements to disclose the manner in which expenses,
payments, allocations, rebates, waivers, and offsets are calculated and to cross-reference sections
of the private fund’s organizational and offering documents.105 We believe this approach would
improve the utility of the quarterly statement by making it easier for investors to review and
analyze. These requirements would support an investor’s ability to understand needed context
provided in the quarterly statement regarding fees, expenses, and performance that allows
investors to monitor their investments. For example, providing investors with clear and easily
accessible cross-references to the fund governing documents would make it easier for the
investor to monitor whether the fees and expenses in the quarterly statement comply with the
fund’s governing documents.
We believe the proposal strikes an appropriate balance in prescribing the content of the
tables and performance information to be included in quarterly statements while taking a fairly
principles-based approach to format. This would help provide investors with standardized
information about their private fund investments, while affording advisers some flexibility to
present the required information without being overly prescriptive or sacrificing readability. We
considered, but are not proposing, to further standardize format, because we recognize this might
result in investor confusion if an adviser includes inapplicable line items to satisfy our form
requirements, while omitting additional relevant information that might be unique to a particular
fund. Moreover, we were concerned that advisers would be unable to report on a consolidated
basis if we further prescribed the format of the statements.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed rule:

105 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(d).
97
• Should the proposed quarterly statement rule include a provision on formatting and
content? Why or why not?
• Do commenters agree with the flexibility of the proposed format and content
requirements, or should we prescribe wording? For example, should we require a cover
page with prescribed wording? If so, what prescribed wording should we require?
• To meet the rule’s formatting requirements, any information that an adviser chooses to
include in a quarterly statement, but that is not required by the rule, would be required to
be presented in a manner that is no more prominent than the required information.
Should the rule, instead, require that advisers more prominently present information that
is required by the proposed quarterly statement rule (as opposed to supplemental
information that is merely permitted)? If an adviser chooses to include supplemental
information, should we require that adviser to disclose what information in the quarterly
statement is required versus that which is voluntary?
6. Recordkeeping for Quarterly Statements
We propose amending rule 204-2 (the “books and records rule”) under the Advisers Act
to require advisers to retain books and records related to the proposed quarterly statement rule.106
These proposed amendments would help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and enforcement
capabilities. First, we propose to require private fund advisers to retain a copy of any quarterly
statement distributed to fund investors pursuant to the proposed quarterly statement rule, as well
as a record of each addressee, the date(s) the statement was sent, address(es), and delivery

106 For all of the recordkeeping rule amendments in this proposed rulemaking package, advisers would be required
to maintain and preserve the record in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than five years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in an appropriate
office of the investment adviser. See rule 204-2(e)(1) under the Advisers Act.
98
method(s). Second, we propose to require advisers to retain all records evidencing the
calculation method for all expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, offsets, waivers, and
performance listed on any quarterly statement delivered pursuant to the proposed quarterly
statement rule. Third, advisers would be required to make and keep books and records
substantiating the adviser’s determination that the private fund it manages is a liquid fund or an
illiquid fund pursuant to the proposed quarterly statement rule. We believe these proposed
requirements would facilitate our staff’s ability to assess an adviser’s compliance with the
proposed rule and would similarly enhance an adviser’s compliance efforts.107
We request comment on the proposed recordkeeping rule amendments:
• Should we require advisers to maintain the proposed records or would these requirements
be overly burdensome for advisers? Are there alternative or additional recordkeeping
requirements we should impose?
• Should we require advisers to retain a record of each addressee, the date(s) the statement
was sent, address(es), and delivery method(s) for each quarterly statement, as proposed?
Should we instead eliminate this requirement because of the potential burdens?
• Should we provide more specific requirements regarding the records an adviser must
maintain to substantiate its determination that a private fund is a liquid fund or an illiquid
fund? Alternatively, should we leave the proposed rule as is and allow advisers
flexibility in how they document this determination?

107 Advisers already are required to retain performance calculation information under the existing books and
records rule and therefore would be required to retain the performance calculation information required as part
of the proposed quarterly statement rule. See rule 204-2(a)(16) under the Advisers Act (requiring advisers to
retain performance calculation information).
99
B. Mandatory Private Fund Adviser Audits
In addition to disclosure, we propose to require private fund advisers to obtain an annual
audit of the financial statements of the private funds they manage.108 In addition to providing
protection for the fund and its investors against the misappropriation of fund assets, we believe
an audit by an independent public accountant would provide an important check on the adviser’s
valuation of private fund assets, which often serve as the basis for the calculation of the adviser’s
fees.
The proposed audit rule would require a registered investment adviser providing
investment advice, directly or indirectly, to a private fund, to cause that fund to undergo a
financial statement audit that meets the terms of the rule at least annually and upon liquidation,
unless the fund otherwise undergoes such an audit. Under the proposed rule:
(1) The audit must be performed by an independent public accountant that meets the
standards of independence 17 CFR 210.2-01(b) and (c) (in rule 2-01(b) and (c) of Regulation SX) that is registered with, and subject to regular inspection as of the commencement of the
professional engagement period, and as of each calendar year-end, by, the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) in accordance with its rules;
(2) The audit must meet the definition of audit in 17 CFR 210.1-02(d) (rule 1-02(d) of
Regulation S-X), the professional engagement period of which shall begin and end as indicated
in Regulation S-X rule 2-01(f)(5);
(3) Audited financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) or, in the case of financial statements of private

108 Proposed rule 206(4)-10. The proposed rule would apply to all investment advisers registered, or required to be
registered, with the Commission.
100
funds organized under non-U.S. law or that have a general partner or other manager with a
principal place of business outside the United States (“foreign private funds”), must contain
information substantially similar to statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
material differences with U.S. GAAP must be reconciled;
(4) Promptly after completion of the audit, the private fund’s audited financial statements,
which include any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP prepared for a foreign private fund, are
distributed; and
(5) The auditor notifies the Commission upon certain events.
109
Additionally, for a fund that the adviser does not control and that is neither controlled by nor
under common control with the adviser (e.g., where an unaffiliated sub-adviser provides services
to the fund), such adviser would only need to take all reasonable steps to cause the fund to
undergo an audit that would meet these elements.
We have historically relied on financial statement audits to verify the existence of pooled
investment vehicle investments.
110 Financial statement audits also provide additional
meaningful protections to private fund investors by increasing the likelihood that fraudulent
activity or problems with valuation are uncovered, thereby providing deterrence against
fraudulent conduct by fund advisers. For example as noted above, a fund’s adviser may use a
high level of discretion and subjectivity in valuing a private fund’s illiquid investments, which
are difficult to value. This creates a conflict of interest if the adviser also calculates its fees as a

109 Proposed rule 206(4)-10; proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “control” and “distributed”).
110 See, e.g., rule 206(4)-2(b)(4) under the Advisers Act; Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment
Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2176 (Sept. 25, 2003) [68 FR 56692 (Oct. 1, 2003)] (“Custody
Release”) (providing advisers to certain pooled investment vehicles with an exception to the surprise
examination requirement if the pooled investment vehicles undergo an audit). Not all advisers are subject to the
custody rule and even those that are subject to the custody rule are not required to obtain an audit in order to
comply with the rule.
101
percentage of the value of the fund’s investments and/or an increase in that value (net profit), as
is typically the case. Moreover, private fund advisers often rely heavily on existing fund
performance when obtaining new investors (in the case of a private fund that makes continuous
or periodic offerings) or fundraising for a new fund. These factors raise the possibility that funds
are valued opportunistically and that the adviser’s compensation may involve fraud or deception,
resulting in an inappropriate compensation scheme.
111 A fund audit includes the evaluation of
whether the fair value estimates and related disclosures are reasonable and consistent with the
requirements of the financial reporting framework (e.g., U.S. GAAP), which may include
evaluating the selection and application of methods, significant assumptions, and data used by
the adviser in making the estimate.112 We believe that this would provide a critical set of
additional protections by an independent third party.
The proposed audit rule is based on the custody rule and contains many similar or
identical requirements, although compliance with either rule would not automatically satisfy the
requirements of the other.
113 Although the financial statement audit performed under either rule
would be the same, there are several differences between the two rules. The most notable
difference between the two rules is the lack of choice about obtaining an audit under the

111 See generally Jenkinson, Sousa, Stucke, How Fair are the Valuations of Private Equity Funds? (2013), available

Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5303 (July 18, 2019) (settled action) (alleging that an employee of a
private fund adviser mispriced the private fund’s investments, which resulted in the adviser charging the fund
excess management fees); SEC v. Southridge Capital Mgmt., LLC, Lit. Rel. No. 21709 (Oct. 25, 2010) (alleging
that adviser overvalued the largest position held by the funds by fraudulently misstating the acquisition price of
the assets); see docket for SEC v. Southridge Capital Mgmt., LLC, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut
(New Haven), case no. 3:10-CV-01685 (on September 12, 2016 the court granted the SEC’s motion for
summary judgment and entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC in 2018).

PCAOB auditing standards, AS 2501.
113 See rule 206(4)-2(b)(4) under the Advisers Act.
102
proposed audit rule. Under the custody rule, an adviser is deemed to have satisfied that rule’s
annual surprise examination requirement for a pooled investment vehicle client if that pool is
subject to an annual financial statement audit by an independent public accountant, and its
audited financial statements (prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles) are distributed to the pool’s investors. Accordingly, an adviser may obtain a surprise
examination under the custody rule instead of an audit. Private fund advisers complying with the
proposed audit rule would not have a similar choice; they must obtain an audit. Based on our
experience since introducing the custody rule’s audit provision, we have come to believe that
audits provide substantial benefits to private funds and their investors because audits test
assertions associated with the investment portfolio (e.g., completeness, existence, rights and
obligations, valuation, presentation). Audits may also provide a check against adviser
misrepresentations of performance, fees, and other information about the fund. Accordingly, the
proposed audit rule would require registered private fund advisers, including those that currently
opt to undergo a surprise examination for custody rule compliance purposes, to have their private
fund clients undergo a financial statement audit.
Another main difference between the requirements of the two rules is the requirement of
the proposed rule for there to be a written agreement between the adviser or the private fund and
the auditor pursuant to which the auditor would be required to notify our Division of
Examinations upon the auditor’s termination or issuance of a modified opinion.114 There is not a
similar obligation under the custody rule for an adviser that relies on the audit provision to
satisfy the surprise examination requirement. Our experience in receiving similar information

114 See proposed rule 206(4)-10(e). See AICPA auditing standard, AU-C Section 705, which establishes three
types of modified opinions: a qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, and a disclaimer of opinion.
103
from accountants who perform surprise examinations under the custody rule has led us to
conclude that timely receipt of this information – from an independent third party – would more
readily enable our staff to identify advisers potentially engaged in harmful misconduct and who
have other compliance issues.
115 This also would aid the Commission in its oversight of private
fund advisers.
The other main difference between the two rules, aside from timing requirements for the
distribution of audited financial statements under the two rules discussed below, relates to their
scope. While both rules pertain to advisers that are registered or required to be registered with
us, the custody rule also contains exceptions from the surprise examination requirement, which
in turn make it unnecessary for an adviser to rely on that rule’s audit provision.116 In light of the
different policy goals of these two rules, we are not proposing a parallel exception to the
proposed audit rule. Moreover, in our experience, private fund advisers generally do not often
rely on these exceptions. The proposed audit rule does, however, contain an exception in certain
contexts where the adviser takes all reasonable steps to cause an audit, as described and for
reasons discussed below, which does not exist in the custody rule.
1. Requirements for Accountants Performing Private Fund Audits
The proposed audit rule would include certain requirements regarding the accountant
performing a private fund audit. First, we propose to require an accountant performing a private
fund audit to meet the standards of independence described in rule 2-01(b) and (c) of Regulation
S-X in support of the Commission’s long-standing recognition that an audit by an objective,

115 See rule 206(4)-2(a)(4)(iii) (requiring somewhat similar information in the context of a surprise examination).
116 See rule 206(4)-2(b)(3) and (6) (providing exceptions from the surprise examination requirement for fee
deduction and where the adviser has custody solely because a related person has custody of a client’s funds or
securities).
104
impartial, and skilled professional contributes to both investor protection and investor
confidence.117 Second, the proposed rule would require the independent public accountant
performing the audit to be registered with, and subject to regular inspection as of the
commencement of the professional engagement period, and as of each calendar year-end, by, the
PCAOB in accordance with its rules. Based on our experience with the custody rule, we believe
registration and the periodic inspection of an independent public accountant’s system of quality
control by the PCAOB provide investors with confidence in the quality of the audits produced
under the proposed rule.
We understand that this requirement may limit the pool of accountants that are eligible to
perform these services because only those accountants that currently conduct public company
issuer audits are subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB. Most private funds, however, are
already undergoing a financial statement audit; therefore, the increase in demand for these
services may be limited.118 Nonetheless, the resulting competition for these services might
increase costs to investment advisers and investors.
We understand that, as part of a temporary inspection program, the PCAOB inspects
accountants auditing brokers and dealers, and identifies and addresses with these firms any
significant issues in those audits.119 Similar to the inspection program for issuer audits, we
believe that the temporary inspection program for broker-dealers provides valuable oversight of

117 See Revision of the Commission’s Auditor Independence Requirements, Release No. 33-7919 (Nov. 21, 2000)
[65 FR 76008 (Dec. 5, 2000)]. The custody rule requires all accountants performing services to meet the
standards of independence described in rule 2-01(b) and (c) of Regulation S-X. See rule 206(4)-2(d)(3) under
the Advisers Act.
118 For example, more than 90 percent of the total number of hedge funds and private equity funds currently
undergo a financial statement audit. See infra Section V.B.4.
119 See PCAOB Adopts Interim Inspection Program for Broker-Dealer Audits and Broker and Dealer Funding
Rules (June 14, 2011) (“temporary inspection program”), available at
https://pcaobus.org/News/Releases/Pages/06142011_OpenBoardMeeting.aspx. See also Dodd-Frank Act
Section 982.
105
these accountants, resulting in better quality audits. Accordingly, we would consider an
accountant’s compliance with the PCAOB’s temporary inspection program for auditors of
brokers and dealers to satisfy the requirement for regular inspection by the PCAOB under the
proposed independent public accountant engagements provision until the effective date of a
permanent program for the inspection of broker and dealer auditors that is approved by the
Commission.120
An independent public accounting firm would not be considered to be “subject to regular
inspection” if it is included on the list of firms that is headquartered or has an office in a foreign
jurisdiction that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely
because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction in accordance with
PCAOB Rule 6100.121 We recognize that there may be a limited number of PCAOB-registered
and inspected independent public accountants in certain foreign jurisdictions. However, we do
not believe that advisers would have significant difficulty in finding an accountant that is eligible
under the proposed rule in most jurisdictions because many PCAOB-registered independent
public accountants who are subject to regular inspection currently have practices in various
jurisdictions, which may ameliorate concerns regarding offshore availability.

120 Our staff took a similar position and has had several years to observe the impact on the availability of
accountants to perform services and the quality of services produced by these accountants. See Robert Van
Grover Esq., Seward & Kissel LLP, SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Dec. 11, 2019) (extending the no-action
position taken in prior letters until the date that a PCAOB-adopted permanent program, having been approved
by the Commission, takes effect).
121 See, e.g., HFCAA Determination Report Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7214(i)(2)(A) and PCAOB Rule 6100 (Dec. 16.
2021), PCAOB Release No. 104-HFCAA-2021-001, available at 104-hfcaa-2021-001.pdf (azureedge.net)
(publishing such list of firms as of December 2021).
106
2. Auditing Standards for Financial Statements
Under the proposed audit rule, an audit must meet the definition in rule 1-02(d) of Regulation SX. Pursuant to that definition, financial statement audits performed for purposes of the proposed
audit rule would generally be performed in accordance with the generally accepted auditing
standards of the United States (“U.S. GAAS”).
122 U.S. GAAS requires that an auditor evaluate
and respond to the risk of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud or
error.
123 Among other benefits of this standard, audits performed in accordance with U.S. GAAS
would help detect valuation irregularities or errors, as well as an investment adviser’s loss,
misappropriation, or misuse of client investments. The proposed rule would require the
professional engagement period of an audit performed under the rule to begin and end as
indicated in Regulation S-X rule 2-01(f)(5).
124
3. Preparation of Audited Financial Statements
The proposed rule also generally would require the audited financial statements to be
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Financial statements of private funds organized under
non-U.S. law or that have a general partner or other manager with a principal place of business

122 Under the definition in rule 1-02(d) of Regulation S-X, an “audit” of an entity (such as a private fund) that is not
an issuer as defined in section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2007 means an audit performed in
accordance with either the generally accepted auditing standards of the United States (“U.S. GAAS”) or the
standards of the PCAOB. When conducting an audit of financial statements in accordance with the standards of
the PCAOB, however, the auditor would also be required to conduct the audit in accordance with U.S. GAAS
because the audit would not be within the jurisdiction of the PCAOB as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, (i.e., not an issuer, broker, or dealer). See AICPA auditing standards, AU-C Section 700.46.
We believe most advisers would choose to perform the audit pursuant to U.S. GAAS only rather than both
standards, though it would be permissible under the proposed audit rule to perform the audit pursuant to both
standards.
123 See AICPA auditing standards, AU-C Section 240. Audits performed under PCAOB standards provide similar
benefits. See PCAOB auditing standards, AS 2401, which discusses consideration of fraud in a financial
statement audit.
124 Among other things, rule 2-01(f)(5) of Regulation S-X indicates that the professional engagement period begins
at the earlier of when the accountant either signs an initial engagement letter (or other agreement to review or
audit a client’s financial statements) or begins audit, review, or attest procedures; and the period ends when the
audit client or the accountant notifies the Commission that the client is no longer that accountant’s audit client.
107
outside the United States would be required to contain information substantially similar to
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and any material differences would be
required to be reconciled to U.S. GAAP. Requiring that financial statements comply with U.S.
GAAP is designed to help investors receive consistent and quality financial reporting on their
investments from the fund’s adviser.
Financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting standards other than
U.S. GAAP, would meet the requirements of the proposed audit rule so long as they contain
information substantially similar to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, material differences with U.S. GAAP are reconciled, and the reconciliation, including
supplementary U.S. GAAP disclosures, is distributed to investors as part of the audited financial
statements.125 We believe that this approach would allow advisers flexibility to provide
investors with financial statements that are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting
standards. We believe a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP is necessary for private fund audits
because U.S. GAAP, has industry specific accounting principles for certain pooled vehicles,
including private funds.
126 As a result, there could be material differences between other
accounting standards and U.S. GAAP, for example in the presentation of a trade/settlement date,
schedule of investments and financial highlights, that we would require to be reconciled.

125 Proposed rule 206(4)-10(c) and (d). See also Custody Release, supra footnote 110, at n.41 (stating that an
adviser may use such financial statements to qualify for the audit exception from the custody rule with respect
to pools that have a place of organization outside the United States or a general partner or other manager with a
principal place of business outside the United States, if such financial statements contain information that is
substantially similar to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and contain a footnote
reconciling any material variations between such comprehensive body of accounting standards and U.S.
GAAP).
126 See U.S. GAAP ASC 946.
108
4. Prompt Distribution of Audited Financial Statements
The proposed audit rule would require a fund’s audited financial statements to be
distributed to current investors “promptly” after the completion of the audit.
127 The audited
financial statements would consist of the applicable financial statements (including any required
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, including supplementary U.S. GAAP disclosures), related
schedules, accompanying footnotes, and the audit report. We considered but are not proposing
to require the audited financials to be distributed within 120 days of a private fund’s fiscal year
end, similar to the approach under the custody rule. Based on our experience administering the
custody rule, we believe that a 120-day time period is generally appropriate to allow the financial
statements of an entity to be audited and to provide investors with timely information. We also
understand, however, that preparing audited financial statements for some arrangements, such as
fund of funds arrangements, may require reliance on third parties, which could cause an adviser
to fail to meet the 120-day timing requirements for distributing audited financial statements
regardless of actions it takes to meet the requirements. We also recognize there may be times
when an adviser reasonably believes that a fund’s audited financial statements would be
distributed within the required timeframe but fails to have them distributed in time under certain
unforeseeable circumstances. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some advisers
were unable to deliver audited financial statements in the timeframes required under the custody
rule due to logistical disruptions. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that there is not an
alternative method by which to satisfy the proposed rule as there is under the custody rule (i.e.,
undergo a surprise examination), we would require the audited financial statements to be

127 Proposed rule 206(4)-10(d).
109
distributed “promptly,” rather than pursuant to a specific deadline. This would provide some
flexibility without affecting investor protection.
Under the proposed audit rule, the audited financial statements (including any
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP prepared for a foreign private fund, as applicable) must be sent to
all of the private fund’s investors. In circumstances where an investor is itself a pooled vehicle
that is in a control relationship with the adviser or its related persons, it would be necessary to
look through that pool (and any pools in a control relationship with the adviser or its related
persons, such as in a master-feeder fund structure), in order to send to investors in those pools.128
Without such a requirement, the audited financial statements would essentially be delivered to
the adviser rather than to the parties the financial statements are designed to inform. Outside of a
control relationship, such as if the private fund investor is an unaffiliated fund of funds, this same
concern is not present, and it would not be necessary to look through the structure to make
meaningful delivery. It would be sufficient to distribute the audited financial statements to the
adviser to, or other designated party of, the unaffiliated fund of funds. We believe that this
approach would lead to meaningful delivery of the audited financial statements to the private
fund’s investors.
5. Annual Audit, Liquidation Audit, and Audit Period Lengths
Key to the effectiveness of the audit in protecting investors is timely and regular
administration and distribution. Under the proposed audit provision, an audit must be obtained at
least annually and upon an entity’s liquidation. The liquidation audit would serve as the annual
audit for the fiscal year in which it occurs. Requiring the audit on an annual basis and at
liquidation would help alert investors within months, rather than years, to any material

128 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “control” and “distribute”).
110
misstatements identified in the audit and would raise the likelihood of mitigating losses or
reducing exposure to other investor harms. Similarly, a liquidation audit would help ensure the
appropriate and prompt accounting of the proceeds of a liquidation so that investors can take
timely steps to protect their rights at a time when they may be vulnerable to misappropriation by
the investment adviser. We believe that it becomes increasingly difficult to correct a material
misstatement the longer it goes undetected. The proposed annual and liquidation audit
requirements would address these concerns while also balancing the cost, burden, and utility of
requiring frequent audits.
The proposed annual audit requirement is consistent with current practices of private fund
advisers that obtain an audit in order to comply with the custody rule under the Advisers Act, or
to satisfy investor demand for an audit, and would provide investors with uniformity in the
information they are receiving.129 When an investor receives audited financial statements each
year from the same private fund, the investor can compare statements year-over-year.
Additionally, the investor can analyze and compare audited financial statements across other
private funds and similar investment vehicles each year. Further, we believe investors expect
audited financial statements to include 12-month periods and rely on this uniform period to
review and analyze financial statements year over year for the same private fund.
With respect to liquidation, we understand that the amount of time it takes to complete
the liquidation of a private fund may vary. A number of years might elapse between the decision
to liquidate an entity and the completion of the liquidation process. During this time, the fund
may execute few transactions and the total amount of investments may represent a fraction of the
investments that existed prior to the start of the liquidation process. We further understand that a

129 As discussed above, differences between the two rules are unrelated to the financial statement audit itself.
111
lengthy liquidation period can lead to circumstances where the cost of an annual audit represents
a sizeable portion of the fund’s remaining assets. While we considered additional modifications
to the audit requirement for a private fund during liquidation, we are concerned that allowing for
less frequent auditing (e.g., every 18 months or two years) during an entity’s liquidation may
expose investors to abuse that could then go unnoticed for prolonged periods. Furthermore, it is
our understanding that allowing for less frequent auditing during liquidation—for example,
requiring an audit every two years in such circumstances—may not necessarily result in a
meaningful cost reduction to advisers or investors.
6. Commission Notification
The proposed rule would require an adviser to enter into, or cause the private fund to
enter into, a written agreement with the independent public accountant performing the audit to
notify the Commission (i) promptly upon issuing an audit report to the private fund that contains
a modified opinion and (ii) within four business days of resignation or dismissal from, or other
termination of, the engagement, or upon removing itself or being removed from consideration for
being reappointed.
130 The accountant making such a notification would be required to provide
its contact information and indicate its reason for sending the notification. The written
agreement must require the independent public accountant to notify the Commission by
electronic means directed to the Division of Examinations. Timely receipt of this information
would enable our staff to evaluate the need for an examination of the adviser. We expect the
Division of Examinations would establish a dedicated email address to receive these confidential
transmissions and would make the address available on the Commission’s website in an easily
retrievable location.

130 Proposed rule 206(4)-10(e).
112
As we noted above, there is not a similar obligation under the custody rule for an
accountant to notify the Commission as there is for a surprise examination, although there is a
requirement on Form ADV for a private fund adviser itself to report to the Commission whether
it received a qualified audit opinion and to provide, and update, its auditor’s identifying
information.
131 However, our experience in receiving notifications from accountants who
perform surprise examinations under the custody rule has led us to conclude that timely receipt
of this information – from an independent third party – would more readily enable our staff to
identify advisers potentially engaged in harmful misconduct and who have other compliance
issues. This would bolster the Commission’s efforts at preventing fraudulent, deceptive, and
manipulative activity and would aid oversight of private fund advisers.
7. Taking All Reasonable Steps to Cause an Audit
We recognize that some advisers may not have requisite control over a private fund client
to cause its financial statements to undergo an audit in a manner that would satisfy all five
elements (paragraphs (a) through (e)) of the proposed rule. This could be the case, for instance,
where a sub-adviser is unaffiliated with the fund. Therefore, we are proposing to require that an
adviser take all reasonable steps to cause its private fund client to undergo an audit that would
satisfy the rule, so long as the adviser does not control the private fund and is neither controlled
by nor under common control with the fund.
132 What would constitute “all reasonable steps”
would depend on the facts and circumstances. For example, a sub-adviser that has no affiliation
to the general partner of a private fund that did not obtain an audit could document the subadviser’s efforts by including (or seeking to include) the requirement in its sub-advisory

131 Form ADV Part 1A, Section 7.B.1, Q.23.
132 Proposed rule 206(4)-10(f).
113
agreement. On the contrary, if the adviser is the primary adviser to the fund, even if it is not the
general partner or a related person of the general partner, it would likely not be reasonable for the
fund not to be audited in accordance with the rule.
8. Recordkeeping Provisions Related to the Proposed Audit Rule
Finally, the proposal would amend the Advisers Act books and records rule to require
advisers to keep a copy of any audited financial statements, along with a record of each
addressee and the corresponding date(s) sent, address(es), and delivery method(s) for each such
addressee.133 Additionally, the adviser would be required to keep a record documenting steps
taken by the adviser to cause a private fund client with which it is not in a control relationship to
undergo a financial statement audit that would comply with the rule. This aspect of the proposal
is designed to facilitate our staff’s ability to assess an adviser’s compliance with the proposed
audit rule and to detect risks the proposed audit rule is designed to address. We believe it would
similarly enhance an adviser’s compliance efforts as well.
We request comment on all aspects of the proposed audit rule and related proposed
amendments to the books and records rule, including the following items:
• Would the proposed audit rule provide appropriate protection for investors? If not, please
describe what, if any, modifications would improve investor protection.
• The proposed audit rule bears many similarities to provisions of the custody rule;
however, one notable difference is that there would be no option to, instead, undergo a
surprise examination and rely on a qualified custodian to deliver quarterly statements.
What would be the impact on advisers to private funds that are not relying on the custody

133 Proposed rule 204-2(a)(21). See also supra footnote 106 (describing the record retention requirements under
the books and records rule).
114
rule’s audit provision? Are private funds undergoing similar audits of their financial
statements for other reasons, or would this represent a new requirement for them? There
also are no exceptions from the proposed rule, as there are in the custody rule, such as the
exception from the surprise examination requirement for advisers whose sole basis for
being subject to the rule is because they have authority to deduct their advisory fees.
What would be the impact on advisers to private funds that are relying on this and other
exceptions? Do many private fund advisers rely on the exception for fee-deduction?
• Do commenters agree that the similarities of the audit requirements for the custody rule
and for the proposed rule would ease the compliance burdens of advisers that would be
required to comply with both? Should the rule provide that compliance with one rule
would satisfy the requirements of the other, given the similarities of the two rules? Why
or why not?
• The application of the proposed rule to registered advisers to private funds seeks to
balance our policy goal with the anticipated costs of the proposed measures. Do
commenters agree with this approach? If not, what would be a more effective way of
achieving our goals?
• Should the rule apply to all advisers to private funds, rather than to just advisers to
private funds that are registered or are required to be registered? Should it apply to
exempt reporting advisers? Why or why not?
• Similarly, should it apply in the context of all pooled investment vehicle clients (e.g.,
funds that rely on section 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act), rather than just in the
context of those that meet the Advisers Act definition of private fund? Should it apply
115
more broadly to any advisory account with financial statements that can be audited?
Why or why not?
• Should the rule provide any full or partial exceptions, such as when an adviser plays no
role in valuing the fund’s assets, receives little or no compensation for its services, or
receives no compensation based on the value of the fund’s assets? Should the rule
provide exceptions for private funds below a certain asset threshold (e.g., less than $5
million)? A higher or lower amount? Should the rule provide exemptions for private
funds that have only related person investors, or that have a limited number of investors,
such as 5 or fewer investors? If yes, please identify which advisers or funds we should
except, from which aspects of the proposed audit rule, and why.
• Should the rule apply to a sub-adviser to a private fund? In situations where a fund has
multiple advisers, is it clear that a single audit of the fund’s financial statements may
satisfy the proposed audit rule for all of the advisers subject to the rule?
• Should the alternative of “taking all reasonable steps” to cause a private fund client to be
audited apply in any situation, rather than just in situations where the adviser is not in a
control relationship with its fund client? Why or why not? Is it sufficiently clear how an
investment adviser can establish that it has “taken all reasonable steps” to cause a private
fund client to obtain an audit?
• Should the rule require accountants performing the independent public audits to be
registered with the PCAOB, as proposed? Should the rule limit the pool of accountants
to those who are subject to inspection by the PCAOB, as proposed? If the rule does not
include these requirements, should the rule impose any alternative or additional
116
requirements on such accountants? If so, describe these additional requirements and
explain why they are necessary or appropriate.
• Do commenters agree that the availability of accountants to perform services for purposes
of the proposed audit rule is sufficient and that even advisers in foreign jurisdictions (or
with private fund clients in foreign jurisdictions) would not have significant difficulty in
finding a local accountant that is eligible to perform an audit under the proposed rule?
Do advisers have reasonable access to independent public accountants that are registered
with, and subject to inspection by, the PCAOB in the foreign jurisdictions in which they
operate? If not, how should the rule address this issue?
• Should the rule require advisers to obtain audits performed under rule 1-02(d) of
Regulation S-X, as proposed? If not, what other auditing standards should the rule
allow? Are there certain non-U.S. auditing standards that the proposed rule should
explicitly include?
• Should the rule require private funds to prepare audited financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as proposed? Should the rule
include any additional requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements? If
so, what requirements, and why?
• As proposed, should financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
standards other than U.S. GAAP for foreign private funds meet the requirements of the
rule provided they contain information substantially similar to statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, material differences with U.S. GAAP are reconciled, and
the reconciliation is distributed to investors along with the financial statements? If so,
should we specify what “substantially similar” means?
117
• Would there be unique challenges to complying with the rule for auditors and advisers to
private funds in foreign jurisdictions? For example, might certain advisers or auditors
face challenges in complying with the proposed rule’s Commission notification
requirement, including because of applicable privacy and other local laws? If so, what
would alleviate these challenges and still achieve the policy goals of the proposed audit
rule?
• Do commenters agree that the proposed rule’s requirement to distribute the audited
financial statements promptly would provide appropriate flexibility regarding the timing
of the distribution of audited financial statements? Should there nevertheless be an outer
limit on the number of days an investment adviser has from its fiscal year end for the
distribution of audited financial statements? If so, what should that limit be? Would it be
more appropriate for distribution to be required within 120 days of the end of the fund’s
fiscal year, as under the custody rule? Alternatively, would a longer or shorter period be
appropriate in most circumstances? Should the timeline for distributing audited financial
statements align with the timeline for distributing quarterly statements under the
proposed quarterly statement rule? Why or why not? We understand that funds of funds
or certain funds in master-feeder structures (including those advised by related persons)
have difficulty satisfying the 120-day requirement and that our staff has indicated they
would not recommend enforcement if certain of these funds satisfy the distribution
requirement within 180 or 260 days of the fund’s fiscal year end, depending on a variety
118
of circumstances.134 If the rule contained a specific distribution deadline, would these
types of funds need a separate deadline or other special treatment?
• Instead of requiring prompt distribution of the audited financial statement to investors,
should we require the statement to be distributed or made available to investors upon
request?
• Should the rule provide additional flexibility, such as for situations in which the adviser
can demonstrate that it reasonably believed that it would be able to comply with the rule
but failed due to certain unforeseeable circumstances?
• Should the rule require annual audits, as proposed? Should the rule require an audit upon
a private fund’s liquidation, as proposed? Should we modify either or both of these
requirements? If so, how should we modify these requirements, and why?
• Advisers would be required to comply with the proposed audit rule beginning with their
first fiscal year after the compliance date and any liquidation that occurs after the
compliance date. Advisers would also be required to obtain an audit annually. We
understand that newly formed and liquidating funds may face unique challenges. For
instance, the value provided by an audit of a very short period of time, such as a period of
less than three-months (a “stub period”), may be diminished because there is a lack of
comparability in the information provided. In addition, we understand that the cost of
obtaining an audit covering a few months can be similar to the cost of an audit covering
an entire fiscal year. We further understand that when newly formed entities have few
financial transactions and/or investments, obtaining an audit, relative to the investor

134 See generally Staff Responses to Questions About the Custody Rule, available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/custody_faq_030510.htm.
119
protections ultimately offered by obtaining the audit, may be burdensome. Should the
rule allow newly formed or liquidating entities to obtain an audit less frequently than
annually to avoid stub period audits? Should the rule permit advisers to satisfy the audit
requirement by relying on an audit on an interval other than annually when a fund is
liquidating? For example, should we allow advisers to rely on an audit of a fund every
two years during the liquidation process?
• If the rule were to permit audits less frequently than on an annual basis, should it also
include additional restrictions or requirements? If so, what restrictions or requirements,
and why? For instance, should it require investment advisers to create and distribute
alternative financial reporting for the fund to investors (e.g., cash-flow audit or asset
verification)? Alternatively, or in addition to alternative financial reporting, should the
rule require advisers to obtain a third-party examination? If so, what should the
examination consist of, and why? For example, would allowing advisers to obtain an
audit less frequently than annually during a liquidation raise investor protection concerns
that additional requirements could address given the potential for a liquidation to last for
an extended period? If so, what additional requirements, and why? For example, should
advisers be required to provide notice to investors of their intent to liquidate an entity in
these circumstances? Should advisers be required to obtain investor consent prior to
satisfying the audit requirement by relying on audits on a less than annual basis? Should
we set an outer limit for the period such an audit could cover (e.g., 15 months)?
• Should the rule define “liquidation” for purposes of the liquidation audit requirement? If
so, how? For example, should we base such a definition on a certain percentage of assets
under management of the entity from or over previous fiscal period(s) or a stated
120
threshold based on an absolute dollar amount of the entity’s assets under management?
Should we base the definition on a calculation of the ratio of the management fees
assessed on assets under management of the entity or some other basis, for example, to
detect whether an adviser is charging management fees on a very small amount of assets?
• Are there risks posed to investors when an entity is liquidating that the proposed rule
does not address? If so, please describe those risks. How should we modify the rule to
address such risks?
• Are there some types of investments that pose a greater risk of misappropriation or loss to
investors during a liquidation that the rule should specifically address to provide greater
investor protection? If so, please describe the investment type; the particular risk the
investment type poses to investors during liquidation; and how to modify the proposed
rule to address such investor risk.
• We are not proposing the filing of a copy of the audit report or a copy of the audited
financial statements with the Commission; should the rule contain such a requirement?
Why or why not?
• Would the requirement for an accountant to comply with the notification requirement
change the approach that an accountant would take with respect to audits that normally
are performed for purposes of satisfying the custody rule? If so, how?
• Should we, as proposed, require advisers to enter into, or cause a private fund to enter
into, a written agreement with the independent public accountant completing the audit to
notify the Commission in connection with a modified opinion or termination?
121
• Do commenters agree that the professional engagement period of an audit performed
under the rule should begin and end as indicated in Regulation S-X rule 2-01(f)(5), as
proposed? If not, why not?
• As noted above, the proposed Commission notification provision bears some similarities
to, and is drawn from our experience with, a similar custody rule requirement in the
surprise examination context with which we believe advisers may likely already have
some familiarity. The regulations in 17 CFR 240.17a-5 (rule 17a-5) require a broker or
dealer’s self-report to the Commission within one business day and to provide a copy to
the accountant. The accountant must report to the Commission about any aspects of the
broker or dealer’s report with which the accountant does not agree. If the broker or
dealer fails to self-report, the accountant must report to the Commission to describe any
material weaknesses or any instances of non-compliance that triggered the notification
requirement. Should the audit rule contain similar requirements? Why or why not? Are
private fund advisers and the accountants that perform private fund financial statement
audits more familiar with Rule 17a-5’s notification requirement than the custody rule’s
notification requirement?
• Do commenters agree that the related proposed amendments to the books and records
rule would facilitate compliance with the proposed audit rule? What additional or
alternative amendments should the rule include, if any?
C. Adviser-Led Secondaries
We propose to require an adviser to obtain a fairness opinion in connection with certain
adviser-led secondary transactions where an adviser offers fund investors the option to sell their
interests in the private fund, or to exchange them for new interests in another vehicle advised by
122
the adviser. This would provide an important check against an adviser’s conflicts of interest in
structuring and leading a transaction from which it may stand to profit at the expense of private
fund investors. The proposed adviser-led secondaries rule would prohibit an adviser from
completing an adviser-led secondary transaction with respect to any private fund, unless the
adviser distributes to investors in the private fund, prior to the closing of the transaction, a
fairness opinion from an independent opinion provider and a summary of any material business
relationships the adviser or any of its related persons has, or has had within the past two years,
with the independent opinion provider.
135
Investments in closed-end private funds are typically illiquid and require a long-term
investor commitment of capital. Such funds generally do not permit investors to withdraw or
redeem their fund interests prior to the end of the term. Open-end private funds may also limit or
restrict an investor’s ability to withdraw or redeem its interest, for example, with side pockets or
illiquid sleeves. Without the ability to cash out all or a portion of their interest from the fund,
investors have historically sought liquidity by selling their interests on the secondary market to
third parties. Advisers typically have a relatively minor role in such “investor-led” transactions,
as investors engage in the transaction directly with the prospective purchaser.
In recent years, advisers have become increasingly active in the secondary market. The
number of “adviser-led” transactions has increased, with the deal value of such transactions
representing a meaningful portion of the secondary market, particularly for closed-end private
funds.
136 Adviser-led transactions are similar to investor-led transactions in that they typically

135 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2. The proposed rule would not apply to advisers that are not required to register as
investment advisers with the Commission, such as state-registered advisers and exempt reporting advisers.
136 See, e.g., Private Equity International, GP-Led Secondaries Report (Feb. 28, 2021), available at
https://www.privateequityinternational.com/gp-led-secondaries-report-2021/ (noting one industry participant
estimated that adviser-led secondary transactions accounted for $26 billion (or 44% of the secondary market) in
123
provide a mechanism for investors to obtain liquidity; however, they also have the potential to
provide additional benefits to advisers and investors. For example, an adviser-led transaction
may seek to secure additional capital and/or time to maximize the value of fund assets. An
adviser may accomplish this by permitting investors to “roll” their interests into a new vehicle
that has a longer term and/or additional capital to invest.137
Adviser-led secondaries often are highly bespoke transactions that can take many forms.
For purposes of the rule, we propose to define them as transactions initiated by the investment
adviser or any of its related persons that offer the private fund’s investors the choice to: (i) sell
all or a portion of their interests in the private fund; or (ii) convert or exchange all or a portion of
their interests in the private fund for interests in another vehicle advised by the adviser or any of
its related persons.138 We generally would consider a transaction to be initiated by the adviser if
the adviser commences a process, or causes one or more other persons to commence a process,
that is designed to offer private fund investors the option to obtain liquidity for their private fund
interests. However, whether the adviser or its related person initiates a secondary transaction
requires a facts and circumstances analysis. We would generally not view a transaction as
initiated by the adviser if the adviser, at the unsolicited request of the investor, assists in the
secondary sale of such investor’s fund interest.
This definition generally would include secondary transactions where a fund is selling
one or more assets to another vehicle managed by the adviser, if investors have the option either
to obtain liquidity or to roll all or a portion of their interests into the other vehicle. Examples of

2020, while another estimated that they accounted for more than $30 billion (or more than 50% of the
secondary market)).
137 An investor would typically obtain liquidity in the event it elects to sell – rather than roll – its fund interest.
138 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1.
124
such transactions may include single asset transactions (such as the fund selling a single asset to
a new vehicle managed by the adviser), strip sale transactions (such as the fund selling a portion
of multiple assets to a new vehicle managed by the adviser), and full fund restructurings (such as
the fund selling all of its assets to a new vehicle managed by the adviser). The proposed
definition also would capture secondary transactions that may not involve a cross sale between
two vehicles managed by the same adviser.
139 For example, an adviser may arrange for one or
more new investors to purchase fund interests directly from the existing investors as part of a
“tender offer” or similar transaction.
While adviser-led transactions can provide liquidity for investors and secure additional
time and capital to maximize the value of fund assets, they also raise certain conflicts of interest.
The adviser and its related persons typically are involved on both sides of the transaction and
have interests in the transaction that are different than, or in addition to, the interests of the
private fund investors. For example, because the adviser may have the opportunity to earn
economic and other benefits conditioned upon the closing of the secondary transaction, such as
additional management fees or carried interest, the adviser generally has a conflict of interest in
setting and negotiating the transaction terms.
Ensuring that the private fund and the investors that participate in the secondary
transaction are offered a fair price is a critical component of preventing the type of harm that
might result from the adviser’s conflict of interest in leading the transaction.
140 Accordingly,

139 We would not consider the proposed rule to apply to cross sales where the adviser does not offer the private
fund’s investors the choice to sell, convert, or exchange their fund interest.
140 As a fiduciary, the adviser is obligated to act in the fund’s best interest and to make full and fair disclosure to
the fund of all conflicts and material facts associated with the adviser-led transaction. See, e.g., Commission
Interpretation Regarding Standard of Conduct for Investment Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No.
125
prior to the closing of the transaction, the proposed rule would require advisers to obtain a
written opinion stating that the price being offered to the private fund for any assets being sold as
part of an adviser-led secondary transaction is fair.
141 This process would provide an important
market check for private fund investors by providing some assurance that the price being offered
is based on an underlying valuation that falls within a range of reasonableness. We understand
that certain advisers obtain fairness opinions as a matter of best practice because investors often
lack access to sufficient information, or may not have the capabilities or resources, to conduct
their own analysis of the price. However, to the extent that this practice is not universal, the
proposed rule would mandate it in connection with all adviser-led secondary transactions.
To mitigate the potential influence of the adviser’s conflict of interest further, the rule
would require these opinions to be issued only by an “independent opinion provider,” which is
one that (i) provides fairness opinions in the ordinary course of its business and (ii) is not a
related person of the adviser.142 The ordinary course of business requirement would largely
correspond to persons with the expertise to value illiquid and esoteric assets based on relevant
criteria. The requirement that the opinion provider not be a related person of the adviser would
reduce the risk that certain affiliations could result in a biased opinion.
143
We recognize, however, that other business relationships may have the potential to result,
or appear to result, in a biased opinion, particularly if such relationships are not disclosed to
private fund investors. For example, an opinion provider that receives an income stream from an

5248 (June 5, 2019) [84 FR 33669 (July 12, 2019)], at 24-25 (“2019 IA Fiduciary Duty Interpretation”). See
also EXAMS Private Funds Risk Alert 2020, supra footnote 9.
141 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “fairness opinion”).
142 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1.
143 See supra section II.A for a discussion of the definition of “related person.”
126
adviser for performing services unrelated to the issuance of the opinion might not want to
jeopardize its business relationship with the adviser by alerting the private fund investors that the
price being offered is unfair (or by otherwise refusing to issue the fairness opinion). By
requiring disclosure of such material relationships, the proposed rule would put private fund
investors in a position to evaluate whether any conflicts associated with such relationships may
cause the opinion provider to deliver a biased opinion. Thus, the proposed rule would require the
adviser to prepare and distribute to private fund investors a summary of any material business
relationships the adviser or any of its related persons has, or has had within the past two years,
with the independent opinion provider. Whether a business relationship would be material under
the proposed rule would require a facts and circumstances analysis; however, for purposes of the
proposed rule, we believe that audit, consulting, capital raising, investment banking, and other
similar services would typically meet this standard.
The proposed rule would require an adviser to distribute the opinion and the material
business relationship summary to investors.
144 We believe that this proposed requirement would
ensure that investors receive the benefit of an independent price assessment, which we believe
will improve their decision-making ability and their overall confidence in the transaction.
We request comment on all aspects of the proposed rule, including the following items:
• Do commenters agree that adviser-led secondary transactions can be of some benefit to a
private fund and its investors?
• Do commenters agree with the scope of the proposed rule? Should the rule apply to all
investment advisers? Why or why not? What are the factors that weigh in favor of
expanding the scope of the proposed rule to apply to a broader scope of advisers than

144 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2.
127
proposed? Are there particular types of advisers that should or should not be subject to
the rule? Should the rule only apply when the adviser or its related person is general
partner (or equivalent) of a fund that is party to the transaction?
• Should certain adviser-led transactions be exempt from the proposed rule? For example,
if the adviser conducts a competitive sale process for the assets being sold, which
ultimately leads to the price, should advisers still be required to obtain a fairness opinion?
Do competitive bids typically represent net asset value? Do prospective purchasers
typically bid at a discount to net asset value? Does net asset value always correspond to
the current value of the assets being sold? Why or why not? Are there other price
discovery processes that we should require to protect investors?
• Should certain adviser-led transactions be exempt from the rule, such as adviser-led
transactions involving liquid funds? For example, if the underlying assets being sold in
the transaction are predominantly publicly traded securities, should advisers still be
required to obtain a fairness opinion? Do such transactions present the same concerns as
adviser-led secondary transactions involving illiquid funds where the underlying assets
are typically illiquid and not listed or quoted on a securities exchange? Are there other
hedge fund transactions that we should exempt from the rule, such as hedge fund
restructurings where an adviser may be merging the portfolios of two different hedge
funds and gives all affected investors the option to redeem or convert/exchange their
interests into the new fund? Should the exemption depend on whether the price of the
transaction is based on net asset value? Why or why not?
• Are there other transactions for which we should require private fund advisers to obtain a
fairness opinion? For example, should we require advisers to obtain a fairness opinion
128
before certain cross transactions between private funds it manages? If so, which
transactions? Should we provide certain cross transaction exemptions, such as
exemptions for bridge financings or syndications where the selling fund transfers the
investments within a short period at a price equal to cost plus interest?
• Should the scope of the fairness opinion be limited to the price, as proposed?
Alternatively, should we require the fairness opinion to cover all, or certain other, terms
of the transaction? For example, should we revise the definition of “fairness opinion” to
a written opinion stating that the terms of the adviser-led secondary transaction are fair to
the private fund? Why or why not?
• Should the rule give investment advisers the option to obtain either a fairness opinion or a
third-party valuation? Why or why not? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a
third-party valuation as compared to a fairness opinion, and vice versa?
• We request comment on the proposed use of “related person.” Do commenters agree that
the fairness opinion should be issued by a person that is not a related person of the
adviser? Should we adopt a different definition of “related person” than the one
proposed?
• The proposed rule would require an “independent opinion provider” to provide fairness
opinions “in the ordinary course of its business.” Do commenters agree with this
approach?
• Instead of requiring disclosure of any material business relationships between the adviser
(or its related persons) and the independent opinion provider, should the rule prohibit
firms with certain business relationships with the adviser, its related persons, or the
private fund from providing the fairness opinion? For example, if a firm has provided
129
consulting, prime broker, audit, capital raising, or investment banking services to the
private fund or the adviser or its related persons within a certain time period – such as
two or three years – should the rule prohibit the firm from providing the opinion? If so,
should the rule include a threshold of materiality, regularity, or frequency for some or all
of such services to trigger such a prohibition?
• Should we require the independent opinion provider to have any specific qualifications,
licenses, or registrations?
• Should we define the term “transaction” in the definition of “adviser-led secondary
transaction”? If so, how should the rule define “transaction”? Should we reference the
various types of adviser-led secondary transactions in the definition? For example,
should “transaction” include only single asset transactions, strip sale transactions, and
other similar secondary transactions? Should we include in the definition of “adviser-led
secondary transaction” transactions initiated by the adviser’s related persons?
• Should we define, or provide additional guidance regarding, the phrase “initiated by the
investment adviser or any of its related persons”? Should we define, or provide
additional guidance regarding, the role the adviser would have to play in a secondary
transaction for it to be considered an adviser-led transaction subject to the proposed rule?
• Should the rule require the fairness opinion to state that the private fund and/or its
investors may rely on the opinion? Why or why not?
• Should we require the fairness opinion to be obtained on behalf of the private fund as
proposed? Alternatively, should we require the fairness opinion to be obtained on behalf
of the private fund investors? Are there characteristics of certain types of adviser-led
130
transactions, such as tender offers, that would require the fairness opinion to be obtained
on behalf of the private fund investors rather than the private fund?
• Should the adviser be required to distribute a summary of any material business
relationships the adviser or its related persons has, or has had within the past two years,
with the independent opinion provider as proposed? Should we provide guidance or
impose requirements regarding the level of detail advisers should include in the
summary? For example, should we require advisers to disclose the total amount paid to
the independent opinion provider by the adviser or its related persons, if applicable?
Why or why not? Is two years the appropriate look-back period? Are there any other
conflict disclosures we should require in the fairness opinion or otherwise require to be
made available to investors?
• Should we define “material business relationship” for purposes of the proposed rule?
Should the rule include a threshold of regularity or frequency (in addition to or in lieu of
the materiality threshold) for some or all of such relationships or services to trigger a
disclosure requirement?
• Should we require advisers to distribute the fairness opinion to investors as proposed?
Alternatively, should we require advisers to only distribute or make the fairness opinion
available to investors upon request?
• We recognize that certain adviser-led transactions may not involve investors rolling their
interests into a new vehicle managed by the adviser. For example, an adviser may
arrange for a new investor to offer to purchase fund interests directly from existing
investors, such as a tender offer. Do commenters agree that the first prong of the
131
definition would cover such transactions? Should the rule treat such transactions
differently?
• Should the rule apply to adviser-led transactions initiated by the adviser or its related
persons as proposed? Is the definition of “related person” too broad in this context such
that it would capture secondary transactions initiated by third parties unrelated to the
adviser? Should we revise the definition of “related person” to include an investment
discretion requirement? Similarly, is the definition of “control” too broad in this context?
• We recognize that, for certain adviser-led transactions, the closing of the underlying deal
may not occur simultaneously with the closing of the new vehicle managed by the
adviser. How should the rule take this into account, if at all? For example, should we
clarify that, for purposes of the rule, an adviser would not be deemed to have completed
an adviser-led secondary transaction until the underlying deal has closed (if applicable)?
Alternatively, should we prohibit an adviser from calling investor capital prior to
obtaining and distributing the fairness opinion?
1. Recordkeeping for Adviser-Led Secondaries
We propose amending rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act to require advisers to retain
books and records to support their compliance with the proposed adviser-led secondaries rule,
which would help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and enforcement capabilities. We
propose to require advisers to retain a copy of the fairness opinion and material business
relationship summary distributed to investors, as well as a record of each addressee, the date(s)
the opinion was sent, address(es), and delivery method(s).145 These proposed requirements

145 See supra footnote 106 (describing the record retention requirements under the books and records rule).
132
would facilitate our staff’s ability to assess an adviser’s compliance with the proposed rule and
would similarly enhance an adviser’s compliance efforts.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed rule:
• Should we require advisers to maintain the proposed records or would these requirements
be overly burdensome for advisers? Are there alternative or additional recordkeeping
requirements we should impose?
• Should we require advisers to retain a record of each addressee, the date(s) the statement
was sent, address(es), and delivery method(s) as proposed? Why or why not?
D. Prohibited Activities
We are also proposing to prohibit a private fund adviser from engaging in certain sales
practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes that are contrary to the public interest
and the protection of investors. We have observed certain industry practices over the past decade
that have persisted despite our enforcement actions and that disclosure alone will not adequately
address.
146 As discussed below, we believe that these sales practices, conflicts of interest, and
compensation schemes must be prohibited in order to prevent certain activities that could result
in fraud and investor harm.
147 We believe these activities incentivize advisers to place their
interests ahead of their clients’ (and, by extension, their investors’), and can result in private
funds and their investors, particularly smaller investors that are not able to negotiate preferential
deals with the adviser and its related persons, bearing an unfair proportion of fees and expenses.
The proposed rule would prohibit these activities regardless of whether the private fund’s

146 See High-End Bargaining Problems, Vanderbilt Law Review (forthcoming), Professor William Clayton (Jan. 8,
2022) at 9 (challenging “the idea that sophisticated parties will demand appropriate levels of disclosure and
appropriate processes without any intervention by policymakers…”).
147 See sections 206 and 211(h)(2) of the Act.
133
governing documents permit such activities or the adviser otherwise discloses the practices and
regardless of whether the private fund investors (or governance mechanisms acting on their
behalf, such as limited partner advisory committees) have consented to the activities either
expressly or implicitly. Also, the proposed rule would prohibit these activities even if they are
performed indirectly, for example by an adviser’s related persons, because the activities have an
equal potential to harm the fund and its investors regardless of whether the adviser engages in the
activity directly or indirectly.148 As noted above, we believe these prohibitions are necessary
given the lack of governance mechanisms that would help check overreaching by private fund
advisers.
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1 would prohibit an investment adviser to a private fund, directly
or indirectly, from engaging in certain activities with respect to the private fund or any investor
in that private fund, including:
(i) Charging certain fees and expenses to a private fund or portfolio investment, including
accelerated monitoring fees; fees or expenses associated with an examination or investigation of
the adviser or its related persons by governmental or regulatory authorities; regulatory or
compliance expenses or fees of the adviser or its related persons; or fees and expenses related to
a portfolio investment on a non-pro rata basis when multiple private funds and other clients
advised by the adviser or its related persons have invested (or propose to invest) in the same
portfolio investment;
(ii) Reducing the amount of any adviser clawback by the amount of certain taxes;

148 Any attempt to avoid any of the proposed rules’ restrictions, depending on the facts and circumstances, would
violate section 208(d) of the Act’s general prohibitions against doing anything indirectly which would be
prohibited if done directly. Section 208(d) of the Advisers Act.
134
(iii) Seeking reimbursement, indemnification, exculpation, or limitation of its liability by
the private fund or its investors for a breach of fiduciary duty, willful misfeasance, bad faith,
negligence, or recklessness in providing services to the private fund; and
(iv) Borrowing money, securities, or other fund assets, or receiving an extension of
credit, from a private fund client.
This proposed rule would apply to all advisers to private funds, regardless of whether
they are registered with the Commission or one or more states, exempt reporting advisers, or
prohibited from registration. We believe that this scope is appropriate since we believe these
activities are contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors and have the potential
to lead to fraud. We are proposing this rule under sections 206 and 211 of the Advisers Act,
which sections apply to all investment advisers, regardless of SEC-registration status.
We request comment on the scope of the proposed rule, including the following items:
• Should the rule apply to all advisers as proposed? Alternatively, should the rule apply
only to SEC-registered advisers? If so, why?
• Should the rule only prohibit these activities with respect to an adviser’s private fund
clients and the investors in those private funds? Should the rule apply more broadly or
more narrowly? For example, should the rule apply to such activities with respect to all
clients of an adviser? Should the rule apply to such activities with respect to persons to
which the adviser offers co-investment opportunities even if the adviser does not classify
them as its clients?
• We have historically taken the position that most of the substantive provisions of the
Advisers Act do not apply with respect to the non-U.S. clients (including funds) of a
135
registered offshore adviser.149 In taking this approach, the Commission noted that U.S.
investors in an offshore fund generally would not expect the full protection of the U.S.
securities laws and that U.S. investors may be precluded from an opportunity to invest in
an offshore fund if their participation would result in full application of the Advisers Act
and rules thereunder.
150 Similarly, the proposed prohibited activities rule would not
apply to a registered offshore adviser’s private funds organized outside of the United
States, regardless of whether the private funds have U.S. investors. Do commenters
agree that registered offshore advisers should not be subject to this rule with respect to
their offshore private fund clients or offshore investors? Should other rules in this
rulemaking package take the same approach, or a different approach, with respect to a
registered offshore adviser’s offshore private fund clients? Please explain.
• Instead of prohibiting these activities, should the rule prohibit these activities unless the
adviser satisfies certain governance and other conditions (e.g., disclosure to investors in
all relevant funds/vehicles, approval by the limited partner advisory committee (or other
similar body) or directors)? Should the rule prohibit these activities unless the adviser
obtains approval for them by a majority (by number and/or in interest) of investors?
Should the rule permit non pro-rata fee and expense allocations if such practice is
disclosed to, and consented by, co-investors?
• Should we amend the books and records rule to require advisers to retain specific
documentation evidencing compliance with the prohibited activities rule? For example,

149 See, e.g., Exemptions for Advisers to Venture Capital Funds, Private Fund Advisers With Less Than $150
Million in Assets Under Management, and Foreign Private Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No.
3222 (June 22, 2011) [76 FR 39645 (July 6, 2011)]; Marketing Release, supra footnote 61, at n.199.
150 See Registration Under the Advisers Act of Certain Hedge Fund Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No.
2333 (Dec. 2, 2004) [69 FR 72054, 72072 (Dec. 10, 2004)].
136
records showing how fees and expenses associated with an examination or investigation
of the adviser or its related persons by governmental or regulatory authorities were paid
or showing the allocations of fees and expenses related to a portfolio investment on an
investment by investment basis? Would advisers be able to obtain or generate sufficient
records to demonstrate compliance with all aspects of the proposed rule? Should we
amend the books and records rule to require advisers to prepare a memorandum on an
annual basis attesting to their compliance with each aspect of the proposed rule?
1. Fees for Unperformed Services
First, the prohibited activities rule would prohibit an investment adviser from charging a
portfolio investment for monitoring, servicing, consulting, or other fees in respect of any services
the investment adviser does not, or does not reasonably expect to, provide to the portfolio
investment.
151 These payments sometimes are referred to as “accelerated payments.”
An adviser typically receives management fees and performance-based compensation for
providing advisory services to a fund. A fund’s portfolio investments may also make payments
to the adviser and its related persons. For example, some private fund advisers enter into
arrangements with a fund’s portfolio investments to provide management, consulting, financial,
servicing, advisory, or other services. The adviser and the applicable portfolio investment would
enter into a monitoring agreement or a management services agreement documenting the
payment terms and the services the adviser will provide.
152 Such agreements often include
acceleration clauses, which permit the adviser to accelerate the unpaid portion of the fee upon the

151 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1(a)(1).
152 Monitoring fees frequently are based on a percentage of EBITDA (earnings before income, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization). The agreements often renew automatically and typically include periodic fee increases.
137
occurrence of certain triggering events, even though the adviser will never provide the contracted
for services.153 The accelerated payments reduce the value of the portfolio investment upon the
private fund’s exit and thus reduce returns to investors.
Because the private fund (and, by extension, its investors) typically bears the costs of
such payments indirectly and the adviser typically receives the benefit, the receipt of such fees
gives rise to conflicts of interest between the fund (and, by extension, its investors), on the one
hand, and the adviser, on the other hand. For example, the adviser receives the benefit of the
accelerated fees without incurring any costs associated with having to provide any services. The
private fund, however, may have a lower return on its investment because the accelerated
monitoring fees may reduce the portfolio investment’s available cash, in turn reducing the
investment’s value in advance of a public offering or sale transaction. An adviser also may have
an incentive to cause the fund to exit a portfolio investment earlier than anticipated, which may
result in the fund receiving a lesser return on its investment.
154 Further, the potential for the
adviser to receive these economic benefits creates an incentive for the adviser to seek portfolio
investments for its own benefit rather than for the fund’s. We believe prohibiting this practice,
which distorts the economic relationship between the private fund and the adviser, would help
prevent the adviser from placing its own interests ahead of the private fund.
In addition to these conflicts, we believe that charging a portfolio investment for
unperformed services creates a compensation scheme that is contrary to the public interest and
the protection of investors because such practice unjustly enriches the adviser at the expense of
the private fund and its underlying investors who are not receiving the benefit of any services.

153 Common triggering events include initial public offerings, dispositions, and change of control events.
154 Such incentive may be mitigated, in certain circumstances, to the extent the adviser’s performance-based
compensation would also be reduced in whole or part by the receipt of these payments.
138
Accordingly, the proposed rule would prohibit an adviser from charging these types of
accelerated payments.
The prohibited activities rule would not prohibit an adviser from receiving payment for
services actually provided. The proposed rule also would not prohibit an adviser from receiving
payments in advance for services that it reasonably expects to provide to the portfolio investment
in the future. For example, if an adviser expects to provide monitoring services to a portfolio
investment, the proposed rule would not prohibit the adviser from charging for those services.155
Rather, the proposed rule would prohibit compensation schemes where an adviser charges for
services that it does not reasonably expect to provide.
We also do not intend to prohibit an arrangement where the adviser shifts 100% of the
economic benefit of any portfolio investment fee to the private fund investors, whether through
an offset, rebate, or otherwise. We recognize that certain advisers offset management fees or
other amounts payable to the adviser at the fund level by the amount of portfolio investment fees
paid to the adviser. However, private funds with a 100% management fee offset would not
comply with the proposed rule if there are excess fees retained by the adviser where no further
management fee offset can be applied and the private fund investors are not offered a rebate or
another economic benefit equal to their pro rata share of any such excess fees.
We request comment on this aspect of the prohibited activities rule, including the
following items:

155 To the extent the adviser ultimately does not provide the services, however, the proposed rule would require the
adviser to refund any prepaid amounts attributable to the unperformed services. See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-
1(a)(1) (prohibiting an adviser from charging a portfolio investment for fees in respect of any services that the
investment adviser does not provide to the portfolio investment).
139
• Are there any scenarios in which we should permit an adviser to charge a fund’s portfolio
investment for unperformed services? If so, please explain.
• Should we prohibit an adviser from being paid in advance for services it reasonably
expects to provide in the future? Why or why not?
• As noted above, if an adviser is paid in advance, and reasonably expects to perform
services, but ultimately does not provide the contracted for services, the proposed rule
would require the adviser to refund the prepaid amount attributable to the unperformed
services. Do commenters agree with this approach? Why or why not?
• The proposed rule specifically references “monitoring, servicing, consulting, or other
fees.” Do commenters agree with this list? Should we eliminate any? Are there
additional or alternative types of remuneration that the rule should reference?
• Do commenters agree that if an adviser shifts 100% of the economic benefit of any
portfolio investment fee to the private fund investors, whether through an offset, rebate,
or otherwise, the adviser would not violate the proposed rule? Why or why not? We
recognize that certain tax-sensitive investors often waive the right to receive their share
of any rebates of portfolio investment fees. How should the rule take into account such
waivers, if it all? For example, to the extent one investor does not accept its share, should
the rule require the adviser to distribute such amount to the other investors in the fund?
Why or why not?
• Should the rule instead permit an adviser to engage in this activity if the adviser satisfies
certain disclosure, governance, and/or other conditions (e.g., disclosure to investors in all
relevant funds/vehicles, approval by the LPAC (or other similar body) or directors)?
140
• The proposed rule would prohibit compensation schemes where an adviser charges for
services that it does not reasonably expect to provide. Is “reasonably expect” the
appropriate standard? Should we provide examples or guidance to assist advisers in
complying with this standard? Does this standard have the potential to reduce the
effectiveness of the rule? Are there other standards we should adopt?
2. Certain Fees and Expenses
The second and third elements of the prohibited activities rule would prevent an adviser
from charging a private fund for fees or expenses associated with an examination or investigation
of the adviser or its related persons by any governmental or regulatory authority, as well as
regulatory and compliance fees and expenses of the adviser or its related persons.
156
Advisers incur various fees and expenses in connection with the establishment and
ongoing operations of their advisory business. Establishment fees and expenses often relate to
the structuring and organization of the adviser’s business, including the adviser’s registration
with financial regulators, such as the Commission. Ongoing fees and expenses often relate to the
adviser’s overhead and administrative expenses, such as salary, rent, and office supplies.
Ongoing expenses also may include those associated with an examination or investigation of the
adviser or its related persons.
The proposed rule would prohibit an adviser from charging a private fund for (i) fees and
expenses associated with an examination or investigation of the adviser or its related persons by
any governmental or regulatory authority, and (ii) regulatory or compliance fees and expenses of
the adviser or its related persons, even where such fees and expenses are otherwise disclosed.

156 Proposed rules 211(h)(2)-1(a)(2) and (3). This prohibition would include fees and expenses related to an
examination or investigation of the adviser by the Commission, including the amount of any settlements or fines
paid in connection therewith.
141
We have seen an increase in private fund advisers charging these expenses to private fund
clients. These types of expenses, which are a cost of being an investment adviser, should not be
passed on to private fund investors, whether as a separate expense (in addition to a management
fee) or as part of a pass-through expense model.
157 For example, we believe advisers should bear
the compliance expenses related to their registration with the Commission, including fees and
expenses related to preparing and filing all items and corresponding schedules in Form ADV.
Similarly, we believe that an adviser should bear any expenses related to state licensing and
registration requirements applicable to the adviser and its related persons, including expenses
related to registration and licensure of advisory personnel who contact or solicit investments
from state pension or similar plans.
We believe allocating these types of expenses to a private fund client is contrary to the
public interest and is harmful to investors because they create an incentive for an adviser to place
its own interests ahead of the private fund’s interests and unfairly allocate expenses to the fund,
even where fully disclosed. For example, in some circumstances, an adviser may charge a fund
significant fees and expenses in connection with an investigation that may not be in the fund’s
best interest. Further, as discussed above, we believe the prohibited fees and expenses are
related to forming and operating an advisory business and thus should be borne by the adviser
and its owners rather than the private fund and its investors.
We do not anticipate this aspect of the proposed prohibited activities rule would cause a
dramatic change in practice for most private fund advisers, other than for certain advisers that

157 Certain private fund advisers utilize a pass-through expense model where the private fund pays for most, if not
all, expenses, including the adviser’s expenses, but the adviser does not charge a management, advisory, or
similar fee. We recognize that this aspect of the proposed rule would likely require advisers that pass on the
types of fees and expenses we propose to prohibit to re-structure their fee and expense model.
142
utilize a pass-through expense model as noted above. We recognize, however, that advisers
often charge private funds for regulatory, compliance, and other similar fees and expenses
directly related to the activities of the private fund. The proposed rule would not change this
practice. For example, the proposed rule would not prohibit an adviser from charging a private
fund for all the costs associated with a regulatory filing of the fund, such as Form D.158 In
addition, we acknowledge that it may not be clear whether certain fees and expenses relate to the
fund or the adviser, or it may not be clear until after a significant amount of time has passed in
certain cases. In these circumstances, an adviser generally should allocate such fees and
expenses in a manner that it believes in good faith is fair and equitable and is consistent with its
fiduciary duty.
We request comment on this aspect of the prohibited activities rule, including the
following items:
• Are there circumstances in which it would be appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors for a private fund to bear (i) regulatory or compliance expenses of
the adviser or its related persons or (ii) expenses related to an examination or
investigation of the adviser or its related persons? If so, please explain. Should we
permit private funds to bear these fees and expenses if fully disclosed and consented to
by the private fund investors and/or an LPAC (despite the limitations of private fund
governance mechanisms, as discussed above)? Should we place any conditions on
charging these fees and expenses, such as caps, management fee offsets, or detailed
reporting requirements in the proposed quarterly statement?

158 Advisers may be liable under the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws if the private fund’s
offering and organizational documents do not authorize such costs to be charged to the private fund.
143
• The proposed rule would likely increase operating costs for advisers that have historically
charged private funds for the types of fees and expenses covered by the proposed rules.
Do commenters believe that advisers would increase management fees to offset such
increase in operating costs?
• Are there any additional types of fees or expenses that we should prohibit an adviser from
charging to a private fund? Alternatively, are there fees and expenses that the rule should
not prohibit?
• Should we provide exceptions to the proposed rules for certain types of private funds
and/or certain types of advisers? For example, should we permit a first-time fund adviser
to charge regulatory and compliance expenses to the fund? If so, why?
• Do commenters agree that many advisers do not currently charge private funds for the
types of fees and expenses covered by the proposed rules and, as a result, the proposed
rules would not cause a dramatic change in industry practice? Why or why not? To the
extent commenters disagree, please provide supporting data.
• Will advisers have difficulty in determining whether fees and expenses relate to the
adviser’s activities versus the fund’s activities? Should we provide guidance to assist
advisers in making such a determination? If so, what guidance should we provide?
Should the rule list certain types of fees and expenses that relate to the adviser’s activities
versus the fund’s activities?
• As discussed above, we recognize that certain private fund advisers utilize a pass-through
expense model. Should the rule provide any full or partial exceptions for advisers
utilizing such models, particularly where the adviser does not charge any management,
advisory, or similar fees to the private fund?
144
3. Reducing Adviser Clawbacks for Taxes
The fourth element of the prohibited activities rule would prohibit an adviser from
reducing the amount of any adviser clawback by actual, potential, or hypothetical taxes
applicable to the adviser, its related persons, or their respective owners or interest holders. We
propose to define “adviser clawback” as any obligation of the adviser, its related persons, or their
respective owners or interest holders to restore or otherwise return performance-based
compensation to the private fund pursuant to the private fund’s governing agreements.159 We
propose to define “performance-based compensation” as allocations, payments, or distributions
of capital based on the private fund’s (or its portfolio investments’) capital gains and/or capital
appreciation.160
Investors typically seek to align their interests with the adviser’s interest by tying the
adviser’s compensation to the success of the private fund. To accomplish this, many private
funds provide the adviser with a disproportionate share of profits generated by the fund, often
referred to as performance-based compensation.
161 The adviser’s performance-based share of
fund profits is often greater than the adviser’s ownership percentage in the fund.162 Although the
percentage can vary, a common performance-based compensation percentage is 20%, meaning
that, for each dollar of profit generated by the fund, the adviser is generally entitled to 20 cents
and the fund investors are generally entitled to the remaining 80 cents.

159 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1(a)(4). Because performance-based compensation may be allocated or granted to
individuals and entities otherwise unaffiliated with the adviser, the proposed definition is drafted broadly to
capture any owner or interest holder of the adviser or its related persons.
160 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1. The proposed rule would not apply to any clawbacks by an adviser of incentive
compensation under an arrangement subject to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations thereunder.
161 Certain private funds refer to performance-based compensation as carried interest, incentive fees, incentive
allocations, or profit allocations.
162 For alignment of interest purposes, advisers often invest their own capital in the fund alongside the third party
capital.
145
Because the profitability of a private fund will fluctuate over time, the amount of
performance-based compensation to which the adviser is entitled will also fluctuate. For
example, a fund may initially generate significant profits due to early realizations of successful
investments, resulting in distributions to the adviser. However, the fund may subsequently
dispose of unsuccessful investments, resulting in losses to the fund. Certain private funds
include “clawback” mechanisms in their governing agreements, which require the adviser (or a
related person of the adviser)163 to restore distributions or allocations to the fund to the extent the
adviser receives performance-based compensation in excess of the amount to which it is
otherwise entitled under the fund’s governing agreement. Typically, this means that the adviser
is required to return to the fund distributions or allocations representing more than a specified
percentage (e.g., 20%) of the fund’s aggregate profits. The clawback mechanism is intended to
ensure that the adviser and the investors ultimately receive the appropriate split of cumulative
profits generated over the life of the fund or the applicable measurement period.
Advisers and investors often negotiate whether the clawback amount should be reduced
by taxes paid, or deemed paid, by the adviser or its owners.
164 For example, if an adviser
received $10 of “excess” performance-based compensation, but the adviser or its owners paid $3
in taxes on such amount, investors often argue that the adviser should be required to return the
“pre-tax” amount ($10), while advisers argue that they should only be required to return the

163 For tax and other reasons, a related person of the adviser, rather than the adviser, often receives the
performance-based compensation from the fund.
164 Fund agreements may require advisers to restore performance-based compensation under other fact patterns as
well. For example, if an adviser has received performance-based compensation, but the investors have not
received the requisite preferred return amount, the adviser may be subject to a clawback. Any such requirement
to restore or otherwise return performance-based compensation under a private fund’s governing agreement
would be covered by the proposed rule. See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 (defining “adviser clawback” as any
obligation of the adviser, its related persons, or their respective owners or interest holders to restore or
otherwise return performance-based compensation to the private fund pursuant to the private fund’s governing
agreements).
146
“post-tax” amount ($7). To support the post-tax position, advisers often argue that they should
only be required to return the portion of excess distributions they ultimately retain (and not the
portion paid to any taxing authority). Advisers also argue that, to the extent the clawback occurs
in any year subsequent to the year in which the performance-based compensation was paid, it
may be burdensome or impractical for the adviser or its owners to amend tax returns from prior
years or otherwise take advantage of loss carryforwards for future tax years.
165
We believe that reducing the amount of any adviser clawback by taxes applicable to the
adviser puts the adviser’s interests ahead of the investors’ interests and creates a compensation
scheme that is contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors, even where such
practice is disclosed. The interests of investors to receive their share of fund profits – without
any adviser tax reductions – justifies the burdens on advisers, including the obligation to amend
tax returns. Advisers typically have control over the methodology used to determine the timing
of performance-based compensation distributions or allocations, such as any waterfall
arrangement.
166 Advisers also typically have control over whether the fund will make a
distribution or allocation of performance-based compensation. Advisers thus have discretion to
defer or otherwise delay payments, particularly if the adviser is concerned about the possibility

165 When the clawback occurs in a subsequent tax year, the “excess” performance-based compensation will likely
have already been subject to tax in the year it was paid, even if the amount subject to the clawback is
determined on a pre-tax basis.
166 Private fund investors often seek to negotiate the waterfall arrangement, and the timing of performance-based
compensation distributions, with the adviser. The issues relating to clawbacks often arise in the context of a
waterfall arrangement that provides performance-based compensation to the adviser on a deal-by-deal basis (or
modified versions thereof), versus a waterfall arrangement that is applied across the whole-fund with
distributions going to investors until the investors recoup 100% of their capital contributions and receive a
preferred return thereon. Both models should generally result in the adviser and the investors receiving the
same split of fund profits over the life of the fund assuming the fund documents have a clawback mechanism.
The main distinction between the two models is the timing of distributions or allocations of performance-based
compensation to the adviser. Whole-fund waterfalls are often referred to in the private funds industry as
European waterfalls; deal-by-deal waterfalls are often referred to as American waterfalls.
147
of a clawback.167 Even if an adviser cannot defer or delay a payment, the adviser can escrow
performance-based compensation rather than making a payment to its owners, which would
allow the adviser to cover all or a portion of a clawback obligation that may arise in the future.
Accordingly, the proposed rule would foster greater alignment of interest between advisers and
investors by prohibiting advisers from unfairly causing investors to bear these tax costs
associated with the payment, distribution, or allocation of “excess” performance-based
compensation.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed rule, including the following items:
• Would this aspect of the proposed prohibited activities rule have our intended effect of
ensuring that investors receive their full share of profits generated by the fund? Is there
an alternative approach that would better produce this intended effect? For example,
should we require advisers to return the entire amount of any adviser clawback, rather
than only prohibiting advisers from reducing the clawback amount by actual, potential, or
hypothetical taxes? Would this approach ensure that investors receive their full share of
fund profits?
• Would the proposed clawback provision result in more whole-fund waterfalls (commonly
referred to as European waterfalls in the private funds industry), which generally delay
payments of performance-based compensation until investors receive a return of all
capital contributions? What other effects would this aspect of the proposed rule have on

167 We recognize that an adviser (and its personnel) may be subject to a tax obligation whether or not the fund
makes a distribution, payment, or allocation of performance-based compensation (e.g., tax allocations of income
may precede or follow cash payments of performance-based compensation), including if the adviser places the
performance-based compensation into escrow.
148
the industry, including with respect to adviser’s ability to attract, retain, and develop
investment professionals?
• Instead of the proposed clawback provision, should we prohibit deal-by-deal waterfall
arrangements (commonly referred to as American waterfalls)?
• We recognize that clawback mechanisms are more common for closed-end funds and less
common for open-end funds. Should the rule separately address performance-based
compensation for open-end private funds? If so, how should we address those funds?
• Is the proposed definition of “adviser clawback” clear? Are there ways in which the
proposed definition is over- or under-inclusive? For example, should the definition
include “all-partner” givebacks or clawbacks (i.e., should advisers be prohibited from
reducing the portion of an all-partner giveback attributable to their performance-based
compensation by taxes paid or deemed paid)?168
• Is the proposed definition of “performance-based compensation” clear? Is it too narrow
or too broad?
• What issues may advisers face in complying with this aspect of the proposed prohibited
activities rule? In particular, what issues may result with respect to amending tax returns
from prior years?
• We recognize that this aspect of the proposed rule might result in delayed payments of
performance-based compensation. For example, during the early stages of the fund, the
adviser may be less inclined to distribute performance-based compensation to investment
professionals that source or manage successful investments. How would this aspect of

168 An “all-partner” giveback is typically a requirement for all investors to return or otherwise restore distributions
to the fund. An adviser may use this mechanism for the purpose of satisfying fund obligations, liabilities, or
expenses.
149
the proposed prohibited activities rule affect the intended incentive effects of
performance-based compensation?
• We recognize that many fund agreements clawback performance-based compensation on
a post-tax basis. We considered, but are not proposing, a rule that would generally allow
this practice to continue, but would prohibit advisers from using a hypothetical marginal
tax rate to determine the tax reduction amount.169 We considered requiring advisers to
use the actual marginal tax rates applicable to the adviser or its owners, rather than a
hypothetical marginal tax rate. Our view is that this approach could be too burdensome
for advisers. Do commenters agree? If we were to adopt this approach, how should we
factor tax benefits realized by the adviser or its owners into the tax reduction amount?
What operational challenges would advisers face under this alternative approach? For
example, would the amount of time it may take to determine the actual tax amount, which
may not be determined until a significant amount of time has passed not justify the
benefits? Do commenters believe that the use of a hypothetical marginal tax rate is a
reasonable and cost-effective method for determining the tax reduction amount, or do
commenters believe that the hypothetical marginal tax rate is too high? Why or why not?
Please provide data.

169 Because many entities that receive performance-based compensation are fiscally transparent for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes and thus not subject to entity-level taxes, determining the actual taxes paid on “excess”
performance-based compensation can be challenging, particularly for larger advisers that have not only a
significant number of participants that receive such compensation but also have participants subject to non-U.S.
tax regimes. To address this problem, advisers typically use a “hypothetical marginal tax rate” to determine the
tax reduction amount, which is usually based on the highest marginal U.S. Federal, state, and local tax rates.
Advisers argue that this approach is a reasonable and cost-effective method for determining the tax reduction
amount; investors argue that the hypothetical rate is too high and therefore reduces the clawback amount to their
detriment.
150
4. Limiting or Eliminating Liability for Adviser Misconduct
The fifth element of the proposed prohibited activities rule would prohibit an adviser to a
private fund, directly or indirectly, from seeking reimbursement, indemnification, exculpation, or
limitation of its liability by the private fund or its investors for a breach of fiduciary duty, willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence, or recklessness in providing services to the private fund.
Currently, many private funds and/or their investors enter into documents containing such
contractual terms. Our staff has observed private fund agreements with waiver and
indemnification provisions that have become more aggressive over time. For example, our staff
recently encountered many limited partnership agreements that state that the adviser to the
private fund or its related person, which is the general partner to the fund, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, will not be subject to any duties or standards (including fiduciary or
similar duties or standards) existing under the Advisers Act, Delaware law, or Cayman Islands
law or will not be liable to the fund or investors for breaching its duties (including fiduciary
duties) or liabilities (that exist at law or in equity).
170
While these contractual terms may be permissible under certain state laws, a waiver of an
adviser’s compliance with its Federal antifraud liability for breach of fiduciary duty to the private
fund or with any other provision of the Advisers Act or rules thereunder is invalid under the

170 See, e.g., EXAMS Private Funds Risk Alert 2022, supra footnote 16 (discussing hedge clauses). See also
Comment Letter of the Institutional Limited Partners Association on the Proposed Commission Interpretation
Regarding Standard of Conduct for Investment Advisers; Request for Comment on Enhancing Investment
Adviser Regulation (Aug. 6, 2018), File No. S7-09-18, at 6, available at https://ilpa.org/wpcontent/uploads/2018/08/ILPA-Comment-Letter-on-SEC-Proposed-Fiduciary-Duty-Interpretation-August-6-
2018.pdf. See also Protecting LLC Owners While Preserving LLC Flexibility, University of California, Davis
Law Review, 51 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 2129, 2133, Professor Peter Molk (2018) (discussing scenarios in which
an investor is induced to “sign away fundamental protections” without understanding the importance of those
protections, without understanding the meaning of certain legal terms, and sometimes without reading the
documents the investor signs).
151
Act.171 The prohibited activities rule would specify the types of contractual provisions that
would be invalid.172 For instance, it would prohibit an adviser from seeking indemnification for
breaching its fiduciary duty, regardless of whether state or other law would permit an adviser to
waive its fiduciary duty. The proposed rule would also prohibit an adviser from seeking
reimbursement for its willful malfeasance. This scope of prohibitions is appropriate because
these activities harm investors by placing the adviser’s interests above those of its private fund
clients (and investors in such clients). By limiting an adviser’s responsibility for breaching the
standard of conduct, the incentive to comply with the required standard of conduct is eroded.
We believe such contractual provisions are neither in the public interest nor consistent with the
protection of investors, particularly where investors are led to believe the adviser is contractually
not obligated to comply with certain provisions of the Act or rules thereunder, or where investors
with less bargaining power are forced to bear the brunt of such arrangements.
173
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed rule, including the following items:

171 See section 215(a) of the Advisers Act; 2019 IA Fiduciary Duty Interpretation, supra footnote 140 (stating that
an adviser’s Federal fiduciary obligations are enforceable through section 206 of the Advisers Act and that the
SEC would view a waiver of enforcement of section 206 as implicating section 215(a) of the Advisers Act.
Section 215(a) of the Advisers Act provides that any condition, stipulation or provision binding any person to
waive compliance with any provision of the title shall be void.).
172 See section 215(b) of the Advisers Act (stating that any contract made in violation of the Act or rules thereunder
is void).
173 See Professor Clayton Article, supra footnote 7, at 309 (noting that “LPAs have been criticized for waiving and
otherwise limiting managers’ fiduciary duties to their investors under state limited partnership law; for seeking
to satisfy managers’ fiduciary duties under Federal law by providing generic and all-encompassing
disclosures…for requiring investors to indemnify managers for liabilities resulting from an extremely broad
array of conduct, including criminal acts committed by managers”). See also The Private Equity Negotiation
Myth, Yale Journal on Regulation Vol. 37:67, Professor William Clayton (2020), at p. 70 (noting that “large
investors in private equity funds commonly use their bargaining power to negotiate for individualized benefits
outside of fund agreements, where the benefit of the bargain is not shared with other investors in the fund… an
investor can use its bargaining power to negotiate for individualized benefits before it negotiates for things that
will benefit all investors in the fund.”); ILPA Model Limited Partnership Agreement (July 2020) (suggesting
standard of care, exculpation, and indemnification language in order to reduce the cost, time and complexity of
negotiating the terms of investment).
152
• We have observed these types of contractual provisions among private fund advisers and
their related persons; do advisers to clients other than private funds typically include
these types of contractual provisions?
• Are there other types of contractual provisions we should prohibit as contrary to the
public interest and the protection of investors?
• Should this aspect of the final prohibited activities rule prohibit limiting liability for
“gross negligence,” or would prohibiting limitations of liability for ordinary negligence,
as proposed, be more appropriate? Why?
• Should the proposed rule prohibit contractual provisions that limit or purport to waive
fiduciary duties and other liabilities in situations where state law permits such waivers?
• Do commenters believe that the proposed rule would increase operating expenses for
advisers? For example, would the proposed prohibition on receiving
indemnification/exculpation for negligence cause an adviser’s insurance premium to
increase?
5. Certain Non-Pro Rata Fee and Expense Allocations
The sixth element of the prohibited activities rule would prohibit an adviser from directly
or indirectly charging or allocating fees and expenses related to a portfolio investment (or
potential portfolio investment) on a non-pro rata basis when multiple private funds and other
clients advised by the adviser or its related persons have invested (or propose to invest) in the
same portfolio investment.
174
An adviser may cause a private fund and one or more other vehicles to invest in an issuer
or entity in which other related funds or vehicles have, or are concurrently making, an

174 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1(a)(6).
153
investment. For example, an adviser may form a parallel fund in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, such as
Luxembourg, to accommodate certain European or other non-U.S. investors that invests
alongside the adviser’s main fund in all, or substantially all, of its investments. An adviser also
may form more bespoke structures for large or strategic investors, such as separate accounts,
funds of one, and co-investment vehicles, that invest alongside other funds managed by the
adviser that have similar or overlapping investment strategies.
An adviser can face conflicts of interest where multiple clients (and/or other persons
advised by the adviser) invest, or propose to invest, in the same portfolio investment, especially
with respect to allocating fees and expenses among those clients (or such other persons).
175 We
believe that any non-pro rata allocation of fees and expenses under these circumstances is
contrary to the protection of investors because it would result in the adviser placing its own
interest ahead of another’s, including in circumstances where the adviser indirectly benefits by
placing the interests of one or more clients or investors ahead of another’s.
176 For example, a
fund may not have the resources to bear its pro rata share of expenses related to a portfolio
investment (whether due to insufficient reserves, the inability to call capital to cover such
expenses, or otherwise). If the adviser causes another fund to bear expenses attributable to such
fund, the fund bearing more than a pro rata share would be supporting the value of the other

175 See EXAMS Private Funds Risk Alert 2020, supra footnote 9. See also, e.g., In the Matter of Rialto Capital
Management, LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5558 (Aug. 7, 2020) (settled action) (alleging that
adviser represented to the advisory committee, which included private fund investors as committee members,
that it had data to support the adviser performing third-party services in house and charging the funds certain
rates; and that the adviser misallocated fees for third-party services to the private funds when such fees also
should have been allocated to the co-investment vehicles managed by the adviser).
176 Because the proposed rule prohibits charging or allocating fees and expenses related to a portfolio investment
(or potential portfolio investment) on a non-pro rata basis, advisers would not be prohibited from charging
vehicles that invest alongside each other different advisory fees or other fund-level compensation. For example,
a co-investment vehicle may pay lower management fees than the main fund.
154
fund’s investment.177 Because compensation structures in the funds may differ, an adviser may
have an incentive to allocate fees and expenses in a way that maximizes its compensation.
Further, an adviser’s ownership may vary fund by fund and thus may create an incentive to
allocate fees and expenses away from the fund in which the adviser holds a greater interest.178
Moreover, we do not believe that fees and expenses attributable to unconsummated – or
potential – portfolio investments should be treated differently than consummated investments,
given that non-pro rata allocations in respect of unconsummated investments generally present
the same concerns as discussed above with respect to consummated investments. If more than
one fund would have participated in an investment that generated “broken deal” or other fees and
expenses, our view is that all such funds should bear their pro rata share of such amount.
We recognize that many advisers do not charge all their clients or potential co-investors
for fees and expenses relating to unconsummated investments. For example, certain advisers
offer existing investors, related persons, or third parties the opportunity to co-invest alongside
the fund through one or more co-investment vehicles advised by the adviser.179 Many advisers
do not charge co-investment vehicles or other co-investors for fees and expenses relating to
unconsummated investments. Instead, such fees and expenses are generally borne by the

177 The proposed rule would not prohibit an adviser from paying a fund’s pro rata portion of any fee or expense
with its own capital. In addition, to the extent a fund does not have resources to pay for its share, the proposed
rule would not prohibit an adviser from diluting such fund’s interest in the portfolio investment in a manner that
is economically equal to its pro rata portion of such fee or expense.
178 On a more granular level, to the extent the adviser’s personnel have varying ownership percentages in the funds,
such personnel may be subject to similar conflicts of interest in determining how to allocate fees and expenses.
179 In some cases, advisers use co-investment opportunities to attract new investors and retain existing investors.
Advisers may offer these existing or prospective investors the opportunity to invest in co-investment vehicles
with materially different fee and expense terms than the main fund (e.g., no fees or no obligation to bear broken
deal expenses). These co-investment opportunities may raise conflicts of interest, particularly when the
opportunity to invest arises because of an existing investment and the fund itself would otherwise be the sole
investor.
155
adviser’s main fund that would have participated in the transaction, in which case the main fund
would bear a disproportionate share of such amount. Such practice, however, places the interests
of the other client and its underlying investors or of the other co-investors ahead of the interests
of the main fund and its underlying investors. Because the other client would receive the benefit
of any upside in the event the transaction goes through, we believe that such client should also
generally bear the burden of any downside in the event the transaction does not go through.
Accordingly, the proposed rule does not include an exception for these types of circumstances.
180
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed prohibited activities rule, including the
following items:
• Should we prohibit non-pro rata fee and expense allocations as proposed? If not, under
what circumstances would non-pro rata allocations be appropriate? For example, we
recognize that advisers often have policies and procedures in place that permit the adviser
to allocate fees and expenses in a fair and equitable manner (or similar standard), rather
than on a pro rata basis; would this better achieve our policy goals? Why or why not?
What specific protections are included in such policies and procedures? Should such
protections be included in the rule? Why or why not? Should there be an exception to the
prohibition where an adviser determines that it is in a private fund’s best interest to bear
more expenses than another managed vehicle and the private fund’s investors agree?
• Should the proposed rule apply to unconsummated – or potential – portfolio investments,
as proposed? Do commenters agree that non-pro rata allocations of fees and expenses

180 To the extent a potential co-investor has not executed a binding agreement to participate in the transaction
through a co-investment vehicle (or another fund) managed by the adviser, the proposed rule would not prohibit
the adviser from allocating “broken-deal” or other fees and expenses attributable to such potential co-investor to
a fund that would have participated in the transaction. Advisers may be liable under the antifraud provisions of
the Federal securities laws if the private fund’s offering and organizational documents do not authorize such
costs to be charged to the private fund.
156
attributable to such investments present the same concerns as the ones discussed above
with respect to consummated investments? Why or why not?
• We recognize that many co-investors do not agree to bear their pro rata share of broken
or dead deal expenses. Would the proposed rule make it difficult for funds to
consummate larger investments where co-investment capital is needed? Would the
proposed rule cause funds to syndicate more deals post-closing once the adviser is
confident that the deal will not fall through?
• Should we include an exception for co-investment vehicles (or certain other vehicles) that
invest alongside another fund managed by the adviser? If so, how should we define “coinvestment vehicle”? Should the rule treat single-deal co-investment vehicles differently
than multi-deal co-investment vehicles? Why or why not?
• Should we define “pro rata”? Should “pro rata” be determined based on each client’s
ownership (or anticipated ownership) of the portfolio investment? Will advisers interpret
“pro rata” differently?
• Where multiple funds invest in the same portfolio investment at different times, the first
fund to invest may initially bear a higher level of fees and expenses than later funds.
Should the proposed rule address fees and expense allocations among funds that invest at
different times, and if so, how? If a significant amount of time has passed between the
first fund’s investment and the later fund’s investment, should the later fund pay interest
on its portion of fees and expenses? Should interest payments always apply when
portfolio investments are made at different times? If not, how much time should lapse
before interest applies?
157
• The proposed rule would prohibit advisers from charging or allocating fees and expenses
related to a portfolio investment (or potential portfolio investment) on a non-pro rata
basis when multiple private funds and other clients advised by the adviser or its related
persons have invested (or propose to invest) in the same portfolio investment. Is the
scope of the phrase “other clients advised by the adviser or its related persons” broad
enough? Should we revise the proposed rule to cover any other clients, vehicles, or other
persons advised by the adviser or its related persons? Alternatively, should we revise the
rule to cover all co-investment structures and arrangements?
• We recognize that a transaction counterparty may request to only contract with one fund
entity, which can result in one fund being liable for its own share as well as another
fund’s share of any transaction obligations, including fees and expenses. If one fund
would be responsible for the liability of another fund, those funds, in certain cases,
contractually agree to bear their pro rata share, often times through a contribution or
reimbursement agreement. Should we prohibit this practice and thus require each fund
entity to contract directly with the counterparty? Alternatively, should we require certain
governance and other protections, such as contribution or reimbursement agreements, if
only one fund contracts directly with the counterparty? Why or why not?
• As noted above, the proposed rule would not prohibit an adviser from charging different
fund-level compensation, such as advisory fees, to vehicles that invest alongside each
other in the same underlying portfolio investment. For example, a co-investment vehicle
may pay lower management fees than the main fund. Is it sufficiently clear that such
arrangements would not be prohibited under the proposed rule?
158
6. Borrowing
The final element of the proposed prohibited activities rule would prohibit an adviser
directly or indirectly from borrowing money, securities, or other fund assets, or receiving a loan
or an extension of credit, from a private fund client (collectively, a “borrowing”).
181 We have
observed many forms of borrowing among private fund advisers and their related persons, such
as using fund assets as collateral in order to obtain a loan from a party other than the fund (i.e.,
borrowing against fund assets), accepting a loan offered by a private fund client, and taking
advantage of a continuous line of credit extended by a private fund client. For example, the
Commission has brought enforcement actions alleging that private fund advisers and their related
persons have used fund assets to address personal financial issues of one of the adviser’s
principals, to pay for the advisory firm’s expenses,
182 or to bribe foreign government officials.183
In these circumstances, the adviser’s related person that is the general partner of the fund
sometimes, for example, causes the fund to enter into the relationship with the adviser without
the knowledge or consent of the private fund investors.
When an adviser borrows from a private fund client, that adviser has a conflict of interest
because it is on both sides of the transaction (i.e., the adviser benefits from the loan and manages

181 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1(a)(7).
182 See In the Matter of Monsoon Capital, LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5490 (Apr. 30, 2020) (settled
action) (alleging that the owner of a private fund adviser borrowed $1 million from a private fund client in order
to settle a personal trade); Resilience Management, LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4721 (June 29,
2017) (settled action) (alleging that a private fund adviser borrowed money from funds in order to pay adviser’s
expenses; and that the CEO of the adviser borrowed money to pay for personal expenses); SEC v. Philip A.
Falcone, [U.S. District Court Southern District of New York, Consent] (Aug. 16, 2013) (hedge fund adviser
borrowed from hedge fund at low interest rate in order to repay adviser’s personal taxes. Adviser failed to
disclose the loan to investors for five months).
183 See In the Matter of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4540
(Sept. 29, 2016), at para. 3 (settled action) (alleging that a private fund adviser authorized the use of investor
funds to pay bribes to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business for its parent company
and its business partners).
159
the client lender). A private fund rarely has employees of its own. Its officers, if any, are
usually employed by the private fund’s adviser. The fund typically relies on the investment
adviser (and, in certain cases, affiliated entities) to provide management, investment, and other
services and such persons usually have authority to take actions on behalf of the private fund
without the consent or approval of any other person. This structure causes a conflict of interest
between the private fund (and, by extension, its investors) and the investment adviser because the
interests of the fund are not necessarily aligned with the interests of the adviser. For example,
when determining the interest rate for the borrowing, an investment adviser’s interest in
maximizing its own profit by negotiating (or setting) a low rate may conflict with its duty to act
in the best interests of the fund.
Moreover, this practice may prevent the fund client from using those assets to further the
fund’s investment strategy. Even where disclosed (and potentially consented to by an advisory
board, such as an LPAC), this practice presents a conflict of interest that is harmful to investors
because, as a result of the unique structure of private funds, only certain investors with specific
information or governance rights (such as representation on the LPAC) would potentially be in a
position to negotiate or discuss the terms of the borrowing with the adviser, rather than all of the
private fund’s investors.
The proposed rule would not prevent the adviser from borrowing from a third party on
the fund’s behalf or from lending to the fund. Private funds sometimes use subscription lines of
credit, also known as credit facilities, to address financing needs. For example, some private
funds use these facilities to address short-term financing needs when the fund makes investments
or participates in a co-investment. Other private funds use such facilities for long-term financing
purposes, for example, when an infrastructure fund decides to use a long-term facility during the
160
development stage of a project before a capital call. In these circumstances, the adviser is not
borrowing from the fund. Similarly, advisers sometimes lend money to a fund in order to
address start-up costs or to manage other expenses (for example, an adviser may pay legal or
operating expenses of several fund clients and then seek reimbursement once the expenses have
been allocated among the advised private funds). Allowing advisers to continue this practice
would provide private funds access to capital, especially when they are in the early stages of
attracting investors. Advisers lending to private funds they manage on terms that do not include
excessive interest rates or other abusive practices do not raise the same concerns that advisers
borrowing from private funds they manage raises because there are fewer opportunities for
abusive practices when the adviser is providing money to, rather than taking money from, the
private fund.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed prohibitions rule, including the
following:
• Should we broaden the scope of the prohibition on borrowings to prevent a private fund
adviser from borrowing from co-investment vehicles or other accounts that are not
private funds?
• Should we broaden the proposed prohibition to apply when an adviser lends to the
fund?184
• Should the proposed rule exclude certain activity from the prohibition (e.g., scenarios
where a private fund makes tax advances or tax distributions to its general partner (or
similar control person) to ensure that the general partner and its investment professionals

184 See, e.g., In the Matter of Clean Energy Capital LLC, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3955 (Oct. 17,
2014) (settled action) (alleging that a private equity fund adviser caused the funds to borrow money from the
adviser without providing notice to investors and by pledging the private equity funds’ assets as collateral).
161
are able to pay their personal taxes derived from the general partner’s interest in the
fund)? If so, what activity should we exclude and why?
• Are there situations in which a fund would agree to lend a start-up adviser money for
initial costs and employee salaries? Are there situations in which a private fund client
should be able to make a loan to a private fund adviser because the economic terms
would be favorable to the private fund? How would we determine that the terms are
favorable to the private fund?
• Should the proposed rule be expanded to prohibit an adviser from borrowing against a
private fund client’s bank account or other assets, where the lender may be a third party
(rather than the private fund)? Why or why not?
• Should we amend Form ADV and/or Form PF to require advisers to report information
about an adviser or its related person lending to, or borrowing from, private funds or
other clients? Why or why not? For example, should we require advisers to report
whether they engage in this practice and to provide an aggregate amount or range of such
loans or borrowings?
• Recognizing the limitations of private fund governance mechanisms, as discussed above,
should we permit borrowing if it is subject to specific governance and other protections
(e.g., advance disclosure to all investors, advance disclosure to an LPAC or similar body,
consent of a governing body such as an LPAC, and/or consent of a majority or
supermajority of investors)? Should we require private fund advisers to make ongoing
disclosures to investors and/or governing bodies of the status of such borrowings? Why
or why not?
162
• Should the rule include any full or partial exclusions for certain transactions that may not
involve conflicts of interest or that may involve certain third parties that ameliorate the
conflicts of interest? For example, should we provide an exclusion if the terms of the
borrowing are set by an independent third party and such third party has the authority to
act on behalf of the fund in the event of a default by the adviser? Why or why not?
• Do commenters envision unintended consequences of this proposed prohibition, such as
in circumstances where an adviser’s related person has its own commercial relationship
with the fund?
• Should the rule prohibit (or otherwise restrict) advisers from lending to private funds they
manage on terms that include excessive interest rates or other abusive practices? To what
extent and under what circumstances does this practice occur? Does it raise similar
concerns to borrowing?
E. Preferential Treatment
In order to address specific types of preferential treatment that have a material negative
effect on other investors in the private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets, we also
propose to prohibit all private fund advisers, regardless of whether they are registered with the
Commission, from providing preferential terms to certain investors regarding redemption or
information about portfolio holdings or exposures.
185 We also propose to prohibit these advisers
from providing any other preferential treatment to any investor in the private fund unless the
adviser provides written disclosures to prospective and current investors in a private fund
regarding all preferential treatment the adviser or its related persons are providing to other

185 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(a)(1) and (2).
163
investors in the same fund.186 Whether any terms are “preferential” would depend on the facts
and circumstances.
Side letters or side arrangements are generally agreements among the investor, general
partner, adviser, and/or the private fund that provide the investor with different or preferential
terms than those set forth in the fund’s governing documents.187 Side letters generally grant
more favorable rights and privileges to certain preferred investors (e.g., seed investors, strategic
investors, those with large commitments, and employees, friends, and family) or to investors
subject to government regulation (e.g., the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(“ERISA”), the Bank Holding Company Act, or public records laws). Advisers often provide
these terms for strategic reasons that benefit the adviser. In some cases, these terms can also
benefit the fund, for example, if the adviser signs a side letter with a large, early stage investor,
then the fund will increase its assets. Increased fund assets may enable the fund to make certain
investments, for example of a larger size, which ultimately benefits all investors. However,
preferential terms do not necessarily benefit the fund or other investors that are not party to the
side letter agreement and, at times, we believe these terms can have a material, negative effect on
other investors.
We recognize that advisers provide a range of preferential treatment, some of which does
not necessarily disadvantage other fund investors. In this case, we believe that disclosure is
appropriate because it would allow investors to make their own assessment. Other types of

186 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b).
187 The proposed rule would prohibit certain types of preferential treatment and would require an adviser to
disclose other types of preferential treatment that the adviser or its related persons (acting on their own behalf
and/or on behalf of the fund) provide to investors. Therefore, the proposed rule typically would apply when the
adviser’s related person is the general partner (or similar control person) and is a party (and/or caused the
private fund to be a party, directly or indirectly) to a side letter or other arrangement with an investor, even if
the adviser itself (or any related person of the adviser) is not a party to the side letter or other arrangement.
164
preferential treatment, however, have a material, negative effect on other fund investors or
investors in a substantially similar pool of assets. We propose to prohibit these types of
preferential treatment because they are sales practices that present a conflict of interest between
the adviser and the private fund client that are contrary to the public interest and protection of
investors. We have tailored the proposed rule to address these different ends of the spectrum.
Prohibited Preferential Redemptions
We propose to prohibit a private fund adviser, including indirectly through its related
persons, from granting an investor in the private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets
the ability to redeem its interest on terms that the adviser reasonably expects to have a material,
negative effect on other investors in that private fund or in a substantially similar pool of
assets.188
Different types of private funds and other pooled vehicles offer different redemption
opportunities, and an investor’s ability to exit or withdraw differs significantly depending on the
fund’s or pool’s liquidity profile. While open-end private funds typically allow for periodic
redemptions, closed-end private funds typically do not permit investors to withdraw their
investments without consent. We understand that some private fund advisers grant one or more
investors more favorable redemption rights. For example, a large investor may negotiate,
through a side letter or other side arrangement, to be able to redeem its interest in the fund
before, or more frequently than, other investors. Advisers enter into such arrangements in
exchange for, for example, a large investor agreeing to invest in the fund or a large investor

188 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(a)(1). For purposes of the prohibitions in proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(a)(1) or (2),
whether an adviser could have a reasonable expectation that the preferential term would have a material,
negative effect on other investors in the same private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets would
depend on the facts and circumstances.
165
agreeing to participate in a future fundraising of an investment vehicle that the adviser
manages.
189 Our staff also has observed scenarios where an adviser establishes investment
vehicles that invest side-by-side along with the private fund that have better liquidity terms than
the terms provided to investors in the private fund.190
We believe that granting preferential liquidity terms on terms that the adviser reasonably
expects to have a material, negative effect on other investors in the private fund or in a
substantially similar pool of assets is a sales practice that is harmful to the fund and its investors.
In granting preferential liquidity rights to a large investor, the adviser stands to benefit because
its fees increase as fund assets under management increase. As noted above, the adviser attracts
preferred investors to invest in the fund by offering preferential terms, such as more favorable
liquidity rights. While the fund also may experience some benefits, including the ability to
attract additional investors and to spread expenses over a broader investor and asset base, there
are scenarios where the preferential liquidity terms harm the fund and other investors. For
example, if an adviser allows a preferred investor to exit the fund early and sells liquid assets to
accommodate the preferred investor’s redemption, the fund may be left with a less liquid pool of
assets, which can inhibit the fund’s ability to carry out its investment strategy or promptly satisfy
other investors’ redemption requests. This can dilute remaining investors’ interests in the fund
and make it difficult for those investors to mitigate their investment losses in a down market
cycle. These concerns can also apply when an adviser provides favorable redemption rights to
an investor in a substantially similar pool of assets, such as another feeder fund investing in the

189 See supra section II.E. (Preferential Treatment) (discussing side letters as a sales practice).
190 See EXAMS Private Funds Risk Alert 2020, supra footnote 9.
166
same master fund. The Commission believes that the potential harms to other investors justify
this restriction.
Prohibited Preferential Transparency
We propose to prohibit an adviser and its related persons from providing information
regarding the portfolio holdings or exposures of the private fund or of a substantially similar pool
of assets to any investor if the adviser reasonably expects that providing the information would
have a material, negative effect on other investors in that private fund or in a substantially similar
pool of assets.
191
Private fund advisers, in some cases, disclose information about portfolio holdings or
exposures to certain, but not all, investors in the private fund or in a substantially similar pool of
assets. For example, an investor may request certain information about characteristics of the
fund’s holdings to satisfy the investor’s internal reporting obligations. An investor can negotiate
to receive certain types of information that is not widely available to all investors; however, an
investor’s success in obtaining such terms may depend on factors including the size of its capital
commitment.192
Selective disclosure of portfolio holdings or exposures can result in profits or avoidance
of losses among those who were privy to the information beforehand at the expense of investors
who did not benefit from such transparency. In addition, such information could enable an
investor to trade in portfolio holdings in a way that “front-runs” or otherwise disadvantages the
fund or other clients of the adviser. Granting preferential transparency, for example through side
letters, presents a sales practice that is contrary to the public interest and protection of investors

191 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(a)(2).
192 See Professor Clayton Article, supra footnote 7, at 316 (noting that large investors can often negotiate fee
discounts or other side letter benefits that smaller investors would not receive).
167
because it preferences one investor at the expense of another. An adviser may agree to provide
preferential information rights to a certain investor in exchange for something of benefit to the
adviser. The proposed rule is designed to neutralize the potential for private fund advisers to
treat portfolio holdings information as a commodity to be used to gain or maintain favor with
particular investors.193 We believe that this proposed prohibition would curtail activity that
harms investors.
Substantially Similar Pool of Assets
The proposed rule would define the term “substantially similar pool of assets” as a pooled
investment vehicle (other than an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or a company that elects to be regulated as such) with substantially similar
investment policies, objectives, or strategies to those of the private fund managed by the adviser
or its related persons.194 Whether a pool of assets managed by the adviser is “substantially
similar” to the private fund requires a facts and circumstances analysis. A pool of assets with a
materially different target return or sector focus, for example, would likely not have substantially
similar investment policies, objectives, or strategies as the subject private fund, depending on the
facts and circumstances.
The types of asset pools that would be included in this term would include a variety of
pools, regardless of whether they are private funds. For example, this term would include
limited liability companies, partnerships, and other organizational structures, regardless of the
number of investors; feeders to the same master fund; and parallel fund structures and alternative
investment vehicles. It would also include pooled vehicles with different base currencies and

193 See Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 33-7881 (Aug. 15, 2000) [65
FR 51715 (Aug. 24, 2000)].
194 Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1.
168
pooled vehicles with embedded leverage to the extent such pooled vehicles have substantially
similar investment policies, objectives, or strategies as those of the subject private fund. In
addition, an adviser would be required to consider whether its proprietary accounts meet the
definition of “substantially similar pool of assets.”
This proposed definition is designed to capture most commonly used fund structures and
prevent advisers from structuring around the prohibitions on preferential treatment. For
example, in a master-feeder structure, some advisers create custom feeder funds for favored
investors. Without a comprehensive definition of substantially similar pool of assets, the
proposed rule would not preclude such advisers from providing preferential treatment to
investors in these custom feeder funds to the detriment of investors in standard commingled
feeder funds within the master-feeder structure. While similar concerns may exist for separately
managed accounts, this proposed rule is designed to address the specific concerns that arise out
of the lack of transparency and governance mechanisms prevalent in the private fund structure.
Other Preferential Treatment
The proposed rule also would prohibit other preferential terms unless the adviser provides
certain written disclosures to prospective and current investors.195 We believe that certain types
of preferential terms raise relatively minor concerns, if fully disclosed. However, we are
concerned that an adviser’s current sales practices do not provide all investors with sufficient
detail regarding preferential terms granted to other investors.196 For example, an adviser to a
private equity fund may provide “excuse rights” (i.e., the right to refrain from participating in a
specific investment the private fund plans to make) to certain private fund investors. Advisers

195 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b).
196 See Juliane Begenau and Emil Siriwardane, How Do Private Equity Fees Vary Across Public Pensions?,
Harvard Business School (2020), available at https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=57534.
169
sometimes grant excuse rights to accommodate an investor’s unique investment restrictions, such
as a mandate to avoid investment in portfolio companies that do not meet certain environmental,
social, or governance standards. This lack of transparency prevents investors from
understanding the scope of preferential terms granted. The proposed rule would prohibit these
terms unless the adviser provides information about them in a written notice.
Increased transparency would better inform investors regarding the breadth of
preferential treatment, the potential for those terms to affect their investment in the private fund,
and the potential costs (including compliance costs) associated with these preferential terms.197
This disclosure would help investors shape the terms of their relationship with the adviser of the
private fund. For example, they might also learn of similarly situated investors who are
receiving a better deal with respect to fees or other terms. An investor also may learn that the
adviser provided fee discounts to a large, early stage investor. Or, an investor may learn that the
adviser granted a strategic investor the right to increase its investment in the fund even though
the fund is closed to new investors or to additional investments by other existing investors. This
may lead the investor to request additional information on other benefits that the adviser’s related
persons or large investors receive, such as co-investment rights. An investor may then be able to
understand better certain potential conflicts of interest and the risk of potential harms or other
disadvantages.
Under the proposed rule, an adviser would need to describe specifically the preferential
treatment to convey its relevance. For example, if an adviser provides an investor with lower fee
terms in exchange for a significantly higher capital contribution than paid by others, we do not

197 The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) includes transparency obligations requiring
disclosure to all investors of any preferential treatment received by a particular investor, including by way of a
side letter. See AIFMD Art. 23.
170
believe that mere disclosure that some investors pay a lower fee is specific enough. Instead, we
believe an adviser must describe the lower fee terms, including the applicable rate (or range of
rates if multiple investors pay such lower fees), in order to provide specific information as
required by the proposed rule. An adviser could comply with the proposed disclosure
requirements by providing copies of side letters (with identifying information regarding the other
investors redacted).198 Alternatively, an adviser could provide a written summary of the
preferential terms provided to other investors in the same private fund, provided the summary
specifically describes the preferential treatment.
The timing of the proposed rule’s delivery requirements would differ depending on
whether the recipient is a prospective or existing investor in the private fund. For a prospective
investor the notice needs to be provided, in writing, prior to the investor’s investment. For an
existing investor, the adviser would have to “distribute” the notice annually if any preferential
treatment is provided to an investor since the last notice.199 An adviser would satisfy its
distribution requirement to current investors by sending the written notice to all of the private
fund’s investors. If an investor is a pooled investment vehicle that is in a control relationship
with the adviser, the adviser must look through that pool in order to send the notice to investors
in those pools.200 We believe this aspect of the proposed rule would require advisers to reassess
periodically the preferential terms they provide to investors in the same fund, and investors
would benefit from receiving periodic updates on preferential terms provided to other investors

198 We are not proposing to require the adviser to disclose the names or even types of investors provided
preferential terms as part of this proposed disclosure requirement.
199 As a practical matter, a private fund that does not admit new investors or provide new terms to existing
investors would not need to deliver an annual notice. However, an adviser that enters into a side letter after the
closing date of the fund would need to disclose any covered preferential terms in the side letter to investors that
are locked into the fund.
200 See supra section II.A.3 (Preparation and Distribution of Quarterly Statements).
171
in the same fund. We also believe that providing this information annually would not
overwhelm investors with disclosure.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed rule, including the following:
• Should the proposed rule apply only to SEC-registered advisers and advisers that are
required to be registered with the SEC instead of all advisers, as proposed?
• Should we prohibit all preferential treatment instead of the proposed approach, which is
to prohibit certain types of preferential treatment (i.e., liquidity and transparency terms
that an adviser reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect) and prohibit all
other types of preferential treatment unless disclosed? Why or why not?
• Should the proposed prohibitions apply only to terms that the adviser reasonably expects
to have a material, negative effect, as proposed? Alternatively, should the proposed
prohibitions apply more broadly to terms that the adviser reasonably expects could have a
material, negative effect? Why or why not?
• Should we prohibit all preferential liquidity terms, rather than just those that the adviser
reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect on other investors in that fund or in
a substantially similar pool of assets? Why or why not?
• Are there certain investors who require different liquidity terms (e.g., ERISA plans,
government plans)? If so, which types of investors and what liquidity terms do they
require? How do advisers currently accommodate such investors without disadvantaging
other investors in the private fund? Should the proposed rule permit different liquidity
terms for these investor types? If so, should the proposed rule impose restrictions in
order to protect other private fund investors? If so, which types of restrictions?
172
• Are there practices related to liquidity and redemption rights that the proposed rule
should explicitly address (e.g., in-kind distribution of securities in connection with a
redemption, side-pocketing of illiquid investments, discounting or eliminating the
management fee while a fund suspends liquidity)? For example, should the proposed rule
prohibit in-kind distribution of securities in connection with a redemption, side-pocketing
illiquid investments, or discounting or eliminating the management fee while a fund
suspends liquidity? Alternatively, should the proposed rule include an exception for
these activities?
• Should we prohibit all preferential transparency regarding holdings or exposures of the
fund or pool, rather than just prohibiting preferential transparency regarding holdings or
exposures that the adviser reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect on other
investors in that fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets? Why or why not?
• Should we define, or provide guidance on, when preferential redemption terms or
preferential information rights would have a material, negative effect on other investors?
If so, what should be some determining factors? Would it be relevant that the redemption
terms would cause another investor to reconsider its investment decision? Please explain
your answer. Should we clarify whether an adviser could disclose information about
holdings or exposures of the fund or a substantially similar pool of assets on a delayed
basis without violating the proposed prohibition? Should the proposed rule expressly
require disclosure to investors after a specified period? If so, what period?
• Are transparency concerns, especially with regard to information that could have an
impact on an investor’s decision to redeem, more prominent with certain fund types (e.g.,
hedge funds, private equity funds)? If so, which types and why?
173
• Should we exempt certain types of private funds from the written notice requirements of
the proposed preferential treatment rule?201 If so, which types of funds and why?
• Should we restrict the use of side letters and side arrangements so that they can only be
used to address certain matters such as, for example, legal, regulatory, or tax issues that
are specific to an investor?
• Should the rule’s prohibitions on preferential terms extend to a substantially similar pool
of assets or apply only to each private fund separately?
• The proposed definition of “substantially similar pool of assets” would not include coinvestments by a separately managed account managed by the adviser or its related
persons. Is this definition too narrow? Why or why not? Would the proposed definition
appropriately capture similar funds? Should it, for example, include circumstances where
a private fund invests alongside a separately managed account? Why or why not?
Should the definition include a co-investment vehicle that is structured as a pool of assets
that invests in a single entity and where the private fund invests in the same entity?
• Should we limit “substantially similar pool of assets” to pools the adviser or its related
persons manage, as proposed? Is the proposed definition too broad or too narrow? The
proposed definition would require the pool of assets to have substantially similar (i)
investment policies, (ii) objectives, or (iii) strategies to those of the private fund. Should
we change “or” to “and” and instead require that the pool satisfy all three requirements
(i.e., have substantially similar investment policies, objectives, and strategies)? Should
we instead require that the pool satisfy only two of the three criteria? For example,
should the definition only require the pool of assets to have substantially similar

201 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b).
174
objectives and strategies (and not policies) to those of the private fund? Are there other
unique characteristics or factors, such as the target rate of return, the proposed definition
should address? Should the definition exclude multi-share class private funds? If so,
why?
• Should we narrow the scope of the term “substantially similar pool of assets” to only
include pooled vehicles that invest or generally invest pari passu with the private fund?
Why or why not?
• Do commenters agree that we should prohibit other preferential terms unless the adviser
provides specific information regarding those terms to prospective and current private
fund investors? Would these disclosures benefit these investors? Should we require
advisers to provide additional information in the written notices? If so, what
information? Should the rule specify what information is required to be included in the
notice?
• Instead of requiring advisers to provide or distribute the written notice, should we require
advisers to only provide or distribute the written notice upon request?
• With regard to current investors, the proposed rule would require advisers to disclose
preferential treatment provided by the adviser or its related persons. Instead or in
addition, should we require advisers to disclose preferential treatment that it has offered
to other investors in the same fund?
• Should we require advisers to provide advance written notice to prospective investors, as
proposed? Should we define “prospective investor” in the proposed rule? If so, how
should we define this term and why? For example, should we define “prospective
investor” as any person or entity that has expressed an interest in a private fund advised
175
by the adviser?202 If not, should we provide guidance regarding how advisers can
identify prospective investors? Should we clarify how advisers that use intermediaries,
investment consultants, or other third parties to introduce prospective investors would
comply with the proposed rule? For example, should we state that advisers must treat the
intermediaries, investment consultants, or other third parties as the prospective investor in
these circumstances? Should the definition include prospective transferees? Why or why
not?
• The proposed rule would require the adviser to provide the written notice “prior to the
investor’s investment in the private fund.” Should we prescribe how far in advance of the
investment an adviser must provide such notice? For example, should we require an
adviser to provide the written notice at least two business days prior to the date of
investment? Should such period be longer or shorter? If so, why? Should the proposed
rule require advisers to provide notice to prospective investors within a certain number of
days before the investor submits its complete subscription agreement (or equivalent)?
Alternatively, should the proposed rule require the adviser to provide the notice at the
time an investor receives the private fund’s offering and organizational documents (e.g.,
limited partnership agreement, private placement memorandum)? Should we instead
require that notice be sent prior to some other action or event? If so, what action or event
and why? Should the proposed rule require advisers to update disclosure they previously
provided, for example, to include preferential treatment that an adviser granted after some
investors decided to invest, but before closing?

202 See CFA Institute Global Investment Performance Standards for Firms: Glossary, CFA Institute (2020)
(defining “prospective investor”).
176
• What impact would the advance written notice requirement have on “most favored
nation” clauses (“MFN clauses”) granted to other fund investors?203
• Should the rule require disclosure of all preferential treatment, as proposed, or should the
rule have a narrower or broader scope?
• Should the proposed rule require the adviser to disclose how it memorialized the
preferential treatment (e.g., formal written side letter, email)?
• The proposed rule would require the adviser to provide written notice. Should the
proposed rule instead allow advisers to disclose this information orally and keep a record
evidencing such oral disclosure? Why or why not?
• The proposed rule would require the adviser to provide notice on an annual basis to
current investors, if the adviser or its related persons provided any preferential treatment
to other investors in the same private fund since the last written notice. The proposed
rule does not specify whether the adviser must provide this on a calendar year basis, the
adviser’s fiscal year, or on a rolling annual basis. Should the rule specify precisely when
the annual period begins and ends? Why or why not? If so, what should the beginning
and ending dates be? Instead of an annual notice, should we require an adviser to provide
the notice within 30 days of providing any new preferential treatment to an investor in the
fund?
• Should we require an adviser to document the years during which it has not provided any
preferential treatment and therefore need not distribute or provide a written notice to
current investors or prospects, respectively? Why or why not? If an adviser has not

203 In an MFN clause, an adviser or its related person generally agrees to provide an investor with contractual rights
or benefits that are equal to or better than the rights or benefits provided to certain other investors.
177
provided preferential treatment to any investors, or has not done so during the applicable
time period, should we require an adviser to send current investors and prospects a
written notice confirming that it does not have any preferential treatment to disclose?
Why or why not?
• The proposed rule would require advisers to provide or distribute a written notice that
provides “specific” information about preferential treatment. Should the proposed rule
define “specific” or use another term to describe the required level of detail?
1. Recordkeeping for Preferential Treatment
We propose amending rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act to require advisers registered
with the Commission to retain books and records to support their compliance with the proposed
preferential treatment rule.204 In connection with the written notices required by proposed rule
211(h)(2)-3, advisers would be required to retain copies of all written notices sent to current and
prospective investors in a private fund pursuant to that rule.205 In addition, advisers would be
required to retain copies of a record of each addressee and the corresponding dates sent,
addresses, and delivery method for each addressee. These proposed requirements would
facilitate our staff’s ability to assess an adviser’s compliance with the proposed rule and would
similarly enhance an adviser’s compliance efforts.
We request comment on this aspect of the proposed rule:
• Would the proposed recordkeeping requirement be overly burdensome for advisers?
Why or why not?

204 Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b).
205 See supra footnote 106 (describing the record retention requirements under the books and records rule). See
also proposed amendments to rule 204-2(a)(7)(v).
178
• Would advisers face more difficulty retaining records regarding prospective investors as
compared to retaining records for current investors? Would it be more difficult for
advisers to keep track of prospective investors? For example, prospective investors may
express interest in a private fund, but may not actually invest. Should we only require
advisers to retain records regarding prospective investors that invest in the private fund?
• The books and records rule under the Advisers Act applies to SEC-registered advisers.
Should we adopt a recordkeeping obligation that would require other advisers (such as
exempt reporting advisers) to retain the written notices that proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3
would require? Why or why not?
III. DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION OF ALL
ADVISERS’ ANNUAL REVIEWS OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
We are proposing to amend the Advisers Act compliance rule to require all SECregistered advisers to document the annual review of their compliance policies and procedures in
writing.206 We believe that such a requirement would focus renewed attention on the importance
of the annual compliance review process. In addition, we believe that the proposed amendment
would result in records of annual compliance reviews that would allow our staff to determine
whether an adviser has complied with the review requirement of the compliance rule.207
The compliance rule currently requires advisers to review, no less frequently than
annually, the adequacy of their compliance policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their

206 Proposed rule 206(4)-7(b).
207 See Compliance Programs of Investment Companies and Investment Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release
No. 2204 (Dec. 17, 2003) [38 FR 74714 (Dec. 24, 2003)] (“Compliance Rule Adopting Release”). When
adopting the compliance rule, the Commission adopted amendments to the books and records rule requiring
advisers to make and keep true a copy of the adviser’s compliance policies and procedures and any records
documenting an adviser’s annual review of its compliance policies and procedures. The Commission noted that
this recordkeeping requirement was designed to allow our examination staff to determine whether the adviser
has complied with the compliance rule. See also rule 204-2(a)(17)(i)-(ii).
179
implementation. The annual review requirement was intended to require advisers to evaluate
periodically whether their compliance policies and procedures continue to work as designed and
whether changes are needed to assure their continued effectiveness.208 As we stated in the
Compliance Rule Adopting Release, “the annual review should consider any compliance matters
that arose during the previous year, any changes in the business activities of the adviser or its
affiliates, and any changes in the Advisers Act or applicable regulations that might suggest a
need to revise the policies and procedures.”
Based on staff experience, some investment advisers do not make and preserve written
documentation of the annual review of their compliance policies and procedures. The
compliance rule does not expressly require written documentation.209 Our examination staff
relies on documentation of the annual review to help the staff understand an adviser’s
compliance program, determine whether the adviser is complying with the rule, and identify
potential weaknesses in the compliance program. Without documentation that the adviser
conducted the review, including information about the substance of the review, our staff has

208 See Compliance Programs of Investment Companies and Investment Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release
No. 2107 (Feb. 5, 2003) [68 FR 7038 (Feb. 11, 2003)] (“Compliance Rule Proposing Release”).
209 The Commission has identified instances where it alleged no annual review of the compliance program was
conducted. See, e.g., In re du Pasquier & Co., Inc., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4004 (Jan. 21, 2015)
(settled action) (alleging that the adviser failed to annually review the adequacy of its compliance policies and
procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation); In re Pekin Singer Strauss Asset Management Inc., et
al., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4126 (June 23, 2015) (settled action) (alleging that the adviser failed
to complete timely annual compliance program reviews); In the Matter of Hudson Hous. Capital, LLC,
Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5047 (Sept. 25, 2018) (settled action) (alleging that the adviser failed to
review its policies and procedures at least annually); In the Matter of ED Capital Management, LLC,
Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5344 (Sept. 13, 2019) (settled action) (alleging that the adviser failed to
conduct the required annual reviews of its written policies and procedures).
180
limited visibility into the adviser’s compliance practices. The proposed amendment to rule
206(4)-7 would establish a written documentation requirement applicable to all advisers.210
Proposed rule 206(4)-7(b) does not enumerate specific elements that advisers must
include in the written documentation of their annual review. The written documentation
requirement is intended to be flexible to allow advisers to continue to use the review procedures
they have developed and found most effective. For example, some advisers may review the
adequacy of their compliance policies and procedures (or a subset of those compliance policies
and procedures) and the effectiveness of their implementation on a quarterly basis. In such a
case, we believe that the written documentation of the annual review could comprise written
quarterly reports.
The regulations in 17 CFR 270.38a-1 (rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act),
the compliance rule applicable to registered investment companies and business development
companies (collectively “registered funds”), do not require written documentation of a registered
fund’s annual review of its compliance policies and procedures.211 However, rule 38a-1 requires
a registered fund’s CCO to provide a written report to the registered fund’s board of directors, at
least annually, that addresses: (i) the operation of the compliance policies and procedures of the
registered fund and each investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, and transfer

210 The adviser would be required to maintain the written documentation of its annual review in an easily
accessible place for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year in which the review was conducted, the
first two years in an appropriate office of the investment adviser. See rule 204-2(a)(17)(ii) and (e)(1).
211 While business development companies (as defined in the Investment Company Act) are exempt from the
registration provisions of that Act, we include them within the term “registered funds” for ease of reference.
See 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48); 15 U.S.C. 80a-6(f). Rule 38a-1(a)(3) under the Investment Company Act requires
a registered fund to review, no less frequently than annually, the adequacy of the policies and procedures of the
registered fund and of each investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, and transfer agent and the
effectiveness of their implementation. Rule 38a-1(d) under the Investment Company Act requires a registered
fund to maintain any records documenting the fund’s annual review.
181
agent of the registered fund; (ii) any material changes made to those policies and procedures
since the date of the last report; (iii) any material changes to the policies and procedures
recommended as a result of the registered fund’s annual review of its policies and procedures;
and (iv) each material compliance matter that occurred since the date of the last report.212 With
registered funds, written accountability has been helpful to ensure compliance with the Federal
securities laws, and the proposed requirements for investment advisers are intended to provide
similar benefits.
213 The proposed required written documentation of the annual review under the
compliance rule is meant to be made available to the Commission and the Commission staff and,
therefore, should promptly be produced upon request.
214 Commission staff has observed claims
of the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or other similar protections over
required records, including any records documenting the annual review under the compliance
rule, based on reliance on attorneys working for the adviser in-house or the engagement of law
firms and other service providers (e.g., compliance consultants) through law firms.215 Attempts
to shield from, or unnecessarily delay production of any non-privileged record is inconsistent
with prompt production obligations and undermines Commission staff’s ability to conduct

212 Rule 38a-1(a)(4)(iii) under the Investment Company Act. For purposes of rule 38a-1, a “material compliance
matter” is defined as any compliance matter about which the registered fund’s board of directors would
reasonably need to know to oversee fund compliance, including violations of the Federal securities laws by the
registered fund. See rule 38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment Company Act.
213 Our staff has observed that registered funds also generally retain these reports with their board meeting minutes,
which aids our staff’s ability to assess compliance with rule 38a-1. See rule 31a-1(b)(4) under the Investment
Company Act (requiring registered investment companies to maintain and keep current certain books, accounts,
and other documents, including minute books of directors’ or trustees’ meetings; and minute books of directors’
or trustees’ committee and advisory board or advisory committee meetings).
214 In connection with the written report required under rule 38a-1, the Compliance Rule Adopting Release stated
that “[a]ll reports required by our rules are meant to be made available to the Commission and the Commission
staff and, thus, they are not subject to the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or other similar
protections.” See Compliance Rule Adopting Release, supra footnote 207, at n.94.
215 Staff also has observed delays in production of other non-privileged records. Delays undermine the staff’s
ability to conduct examinations, and may be inconsistent with production obligations.
182
examinations. Prompt access to all records is critical for protecting investors and to an effective
and efficient examination program.
We request comment on the proposed amendments to the compliance rule:
• Should we expressly require advisers to document the annual review of their compliance
policies and procedures in writing, as proposed? If not, why?
• Should we specify certain elements that must be included in the written documentation of
the annual review? For example, should we require the written documentation to address
matters similar to those that are required in the chief compliance officer’s written report
to a registered fund’s board of directors pursuant to rule 38a-1 under the Investment
Company Act? Despite the limitations of private fund governance mechanisms, as
discussed above, should we require the new documentation to be provided to LPACs,
directors, or other governing bodies of private funds? Why or why not?
• Are there alternate means to document an adviser’s annual review of its compliance
program?
• Are there exceptions to the written documentation requirement that we should adopt?
IV. TRANSITION PERIOD AND COMPLIANCE DATE
We are proposing a one-year transition period to provide time for advisers to come into
compliance with these new and amended rules if they are adopted. Accordingly, we propose that
the compliance date of any adoption of this proposal would be one year following the rules’
effective dates, which would be sixty days after the date of publication of the rules in the Federal
Register.
Staff in the Division of Investment Management is reviewing staff statements, including
staff no-action letters and staff interpretative letters, to determine whether any statements, or
183
portions thereof, should be withdrawn or modified in connection with any adoption of this
proposal. Upon the adoption of any rule, some letters and other staff statements, or portions
thereof, may be moot, superseded, or otherwise inconsistent with the rule and, therefore, would
be withdrawn or modified. If interested parties believe that certain letters or other staff
statements, or portions thereof, should be withdrawn or modified, they should identify the letter
or statement, state why it is relevant to the proposed rule, how it or any specific portion thereof
should be treated, and the reason therefor. Interested parties also should explain any concerns
with the withdrawal or modification of any staff statements and letters on this topic.
We request comments on the proposed transition period:
• Do commenters agree that a one-year transition period following each rule’s effective
date if adopted is appropriate? Should the period be shorter or longer? For example,
would six months be an appropriate amount of time? Alternatively, would eighteen
months be necessary?
• Should the transition period be the same for all of the proposed new and amended rules if
adopted? Should we have different compliances dates for each proposed rule? Why or
why not, and for which rules?
• Should the transition period be the same for all advisers subject to the proposed rules, if
adopted? Alternatively, should we adopt a tiered transition period for smaller or larger
entities? For example, should we provide an additional six months in the transition
period for smaller entities (or some other shorter or longer period)? How should we
define smaller entities for this purpose?
• Should advisers to certain fund types have a longer (or shorter) transition period? Would
compliance with some or all of the proposed rules be more complex for advisers to
184
certain fund types, such as private equity, venture capital, real estate or other similar
closed-end private funds, than for advisers to other fund types, such as hedge funds or
other similar open-end private funds?
• The proposed quarterly statement rule would require advisers to report performance since
the fund’s inception. Should we allow funds that existed before the compliance date of
the proposed rule to include performance information only for periods beginning on or
after the proposed rule’s compliance date? Should the proposed rule include a maximum
period of time that funds that are in existence as of the compliance date must look back in
order to report performance, fees, and expenses? Is it common practice for older funds
(e.g., hedge fund incepted 30 years ago) to retain records to support that performance?
Would it be burdensome for advisers to provide since-inception performance
information?
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
We are mindful of the costs imposed by, and the benefits obtained from, our rules.
Whenever we engage in rulemaking and are required to consider or determine whether an action
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, section 202(c) of the Advisers Act requires the
Commission to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action would
promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The following analysis considers, in
detail, the potential economic effects that may result from this rulemaking, including the benefits
and costs to market participants as well as the broader implications of the proposed rules for
efficiency, competition, and capital formation.
185
Where possible, the Commission quantifies the likely economic effects of its proposed
amendments and rules. However, the Commission is unable to quantify certain economic effects
because it lacks the information necessary to provide estimates or ranges of costs. Further, in
some cases, quantification would require numerous assumptions to forecast how investment
advisers and other affected parties would respond to the proposed amendments and rules, and
how those responses would in turn affect the broader markets in which they operate. In addition,
many factors determining the economic effects of the proposed amendments and rules would be
firm-specific and thus inherently difficult to quantify, such that, even if it were possible to
calculate a range of potential quantitative estimates, that range would be so wide as to not be
informative about the magnitude of the benefits or costs associated with the proposed rules.
Many parts of the discussion below are, therefore, qualitative in nature. As described more fully
below, the Commission is providing a qualitative assessment and, where feasible, a quantified
estimate of the economic effects.
B. Economic Baseline
The economic baseline against which we evaluate and measure the economic effects of
the proposed rules, including its potential effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation, is the state of the world in the absence of the proposed rules. We consider the current
business practices and disclosure practices of private fund advisers, as well as the current
regulation and the forms of external monitoring and investor protections that are currently in
place. In addition, in considering the current business and disclosure practices, we consider the
usefulness of the information that investment advisers provide to investors about the private
funds in which those investors invest, including information that may be helpful for deciding
whether to invest (or remain invested) in the fund, monitoring an investment in the fund (in
relation to fund documents and in relation to other funds), and other purposes. We further
186
consider the effectiveness of the disclosures in providing useful information to the investor. For
example, fund disclosures can have direct effects on investors by affecting their ability to assess
costs and returns and to identify the funds that align with their investment preferences and
objectives. Disclosures can also help investors monitor their private fund advisers’ conduct,
depending in part on the extent to which private funds lack governance mechanisms that would
otherwise help check adviser conduct. Disclosures can therefore influence the matches between
investor choices of private funds and preferences over private fund terms, investment strategies,
and investment outcomes, with more effective disclosures resulting in improved matches.
1. Industry Statistics and Affected Parties
The proposed quarterly statement, audit, and adviser-led secondary rules would apply to
all SEC registered investment advisers (“RIAs”) with private fund clients.
216 Proposed
amendments to the books and records rule would also impose corresponding recordkeeping
obligations on these advisers.217 The proposed performance requirements of the quarterly
statement rule would vary according to whether the RIA determines the fund is a liquid fund,
such as a hedge fund, or an illiquid fund, such as a private equity fund.218 According to Form
ADV data, there are 5,139 such RIAs with private fund clients.
The proposed prohibited activity and preferential treatment rules would apply to all
advisers to private funds, regardless of whether the advisers are registered with or reporting as
exempt reporting advisers (“ERAs”) to the Commission or one or more state securities

216 See proposed rules 206(4)-10, 211(h)(1)-2, 211(h)(2)-2. As discussed above, the proposed rules that pertain to
registered investment advisers apply to all investment advisers registered, or required to be registered, with the
Commission. See supra section II.
217 See proposed rules 204-2(a)(20), (21), (22), and (23).
218 See proposed rules 211(h)(1)-2(d).
187
commissioners or are otherwise not required to register. Proposed amendments to the books and
records rule would also impose corresponding recordkeeping obligations on private fund
advisers if they are registered with the Commission.219 Based on Form ADV data, this would
include approximately 12,500 advisers to private funds, across RIAs and ERAs.220
The proposed amendments to the compliance rule would affect all RIAs, regardless of
whether they have private fund clients. According to Form ADV data, there are 15,283 RIAs,
across both those who do and do not have private fund clients.
The parties affected by these various proposed rules would include the private fund
advisers, advisers to other client types (with respect to the proposed amendments to the
compliance rule), private funds, private fund investors, certain other pooled investment vehicles
and clients advised by private fund advisers and their related persons, and others to whom those
affected parties would turn for assistance in responding to the proposed rules. Private fund
investors are generally institutional investors (including, for example, retirement plans, trusts,
endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies), as well as high net worth
individuals. In addition, the parties affected by these various proposed rules could include
private fund portfolio investments, such as portfolio companies. For example, certain types of
fees, such as accelerated payment fees, would no longer be able to be charged to those portfolio
companies.
The relationships between the affected parties are governed in part by current rules under
the Advisers Act, as discussed in Section V.B.3. In addition, relationships between funds and

219 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(7)(v) (imposing recordkeeping requirements for notices required under the proposed
preferential treatment rule).
220 See infra footnote 416 (with accompanying text).
188
investors generally depend on fund governance.221 Private funds typically lack fully independent
governance mechanisms, such as an independent board of directors or LPAC with direct access
to fund information, that would help monitor and govern private fund adviser conduct and check
possible overreaching. Although some private funds may have LPACs or boards of directors,
these types of bodies may not have the necessary independence, authority, or accountability to
oversee and consent to these conflicts or other harmful practices as they may not have sufficient
access, information, or authority to perform a broad oversight role. Moreover, the interests of
one or more private fund investors may not represent the interests of, or may otherwise conflict
with the interests of, other investors in the private fund due to business or personal relationships
or other private fund investments, among other factors. To the extent investors are afforded
governance or similar rights, such as LPAC representation, certain fund agreements permit such
investors to exercise their rights in a manner that places their interests ahead of the private fund
or the investors as a whole. For example, certain fund agreements state that, subject to
applicable law, LPAC members owe no duties to the private fund or to any of the other investors
in the private fund and are not obligated to act in the interests of the private fund or the other
investors as a whole.222
Based on Form ADV filing data between October 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021,
5,139 RIAs and 4,900 ERAs reported that they are advisers to private funds.
223 Based on Form

221 See e.g., Lucian Bebchuk, Alma Cohen, and Scott Hirst, The Agency Problems of Institutional Investors,
Journal of Economic Perspectives (2017). See also John Morley, The Separation of Funds and Managers: A
Theory of Investment Fund Structure and Regulation, 123 Yale Law Journal 1231-1287 (2014); Paul G.
Mahoney, Manager-Investor Conflicts in Mutual Funds, 18 Journal of Economic Perspectives 161-182 (2004).
222 We observe that LPACs tend to be limited in their ability to receive disclosures about, oversee, or provide
approval or consent for addition, private funds also do not have comprehensive mechanisms for such
governance by fund investors.
223 Form ADV Item 5.F.2 and Item 12.A.
189
ADV data, hedge funds and private equity funds are the most frequently reported private funds

RIAs, ERAs have fewer assets under management and are more frequently venture capital (VC)
funds, followed by private equity funds and hedge funds, with real estate funds more uncommon.

equity funds reported by RIAs on Form ADV during this period grew from $2.6 trillion to $5.1
trillion, or by 96 percent. The assets under management of hedge funds reported by RIAs grew
from $6.1 trillion to $8.4 trillion, or by 38 percent.

2. Sales Practices, Compensation Arrangements, and Other Business
Practices of Private Fund Advisers
Advisers have a fiduciary duty to clients, including private fund clients, that is comprised
of a duty of care and a duty of loyalty enforceable under the antifraud provision of Section
206.
227 The duty of care includes, among other things: (i) the duty to provide advice that is in
the best interest of the client, (ii) the duty to seek best execution of a client’s transactions where
the adviser has the responsibility to select broker-dealers to execute client trades, and (iii) the

226 See Form ADV data.
227 See 2019 IA Fiduciary Duty Interpretation, see also supra footnote 140. Investment advisers also have antifraud
liability with respect to prospective clients under section 206 of the Advisers Act, which, among other aspects,
applies to transactions, practices, or courses of business which operate as a fraud or deceit upon prospective
clients.

duty to provide advice and monitoring over the course of the relationship.228 The duty of loyalty
requires that an adviser not subordinate its client’s interests to its own.229 Private fund advisers
are also prohibited from engaging in fraud under the general antifraud and anti-manipulation
provisions of the Federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act (and rule
10b-5 thereunder) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.
Private fund advisers are also subject to rule 206(4)-8 under the Advisers Act, which
prohibits investment advisers to pooled investment vehicles, which include private funds, from
(1) making any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, to any investor or prospective investor in the pooled investment vehicle; or (2)
otherwise engaging in any act, practice, or course of business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative with respect to any investor or prospective investor in the pooled investment
vehicle. There are no particularized requirements, however, that deal with many of the revised
requirements in this proposal. For example, there is no regulation requiring an adviser to
disclose multiple different measures of performance to its investors, to refrain from borrowing
from a private fund client, to obtain a fairness opinion from an independent opinion provider
when leading secondary transactions, or to disclose preferential treatment of certain investors to
other investors.
In the absence of more particularized requirements, we have observed business practices
of private fund advisers that enrich advisers without providing any benefit of services to the
private fund and its underlying investors or create incentives for an adviser to place its own

228 Id.
229 Id.
192
interests ahead of the private fund’s interests. For example, as discussed above, some private
fund advisers have entered into arrangements with a fund’s portfolio investments to provide
services which permit the adviser to accelerate the unpaid portion of fees upon the occurrence of
certain triggering events, even though the adviser will never provide the contracted-for
services.230 These fees enrich advisers without providing the benefit of any services to the
private fund and its underlying investors.
We have also seen a trend in the industry where certain advisers charge a private fund for
fees and expenses incurred by the adviser in connection with the establishment and ongoing
operations of its advisory business.
231 We recognize, for example, that certain private fund
advisers, most notably for hedge funds that utilize a “pass-through” expense model, employ an
arrangement where the private fund pays for most, if not all, of the adviser’s expenses, and that
in exchange, the adviser does not charge a management, advisory, or similar fee (but does charge
an incentive or performance fee on net returns of the private fund).
232 Under these or other
similar circumstances in which advisers charge private funds fees associated with the adviser’s
cost of being an investment adviser, investor returns are reduced by the amount of the adviser’s
overhead and operating costs.
Some investors may not anticipate the performance implications of these disclosed costs,
or may avoid investments out of concern that such costs may be present. For those investors,
this could lead to a mismatch between investor choices of private funds and their preferences

230 See supra section II.D.1.
231 See supra section II.D.2.
232 See, e.g., Eli Hoffmann, Welcome To Hedge Funds’ Stunning Pass-Through Fees, Seeking Alpha (Jan. 24,
2017), available at https://seekingalpha.com/article/4038915-welcome-to-hedge-funds-stunning-pass-throughfees.
193
over private fund terms, investment strategies, and investment outcomes, relative to what would
occur in the absence of such unexpected or uncertain costs.
In addition, our staff has observed instances in which advisers have entered into
agreements that reduce the amount of clawbacks by taxes paid, or deemed to be paid, by the
adviser or its owners,233 and instances in which limited partnership agreements limit or eliminate
liability for adviser misconduct.234 While these agreements are negotiated between fund advisers
and investors, as discussed above advisers often have discretion over the timing of fund
payments, and so may have greater control over risks of clawbacks than anticipated by
investors.
235 As such, reducing the amount of clawbacks by actual, potential, or hypothetical
taxes therefore passes an unnecessary and avoidable cost to investors. This cost denies investors
the restoration of distributions or allocations to the fund that they would have been entitled to
receive in the absence of an excess of performance-based compensation paid to the adviser or a
related person. These clawback terms can therefore reduce the alignment between the fund
adviser’s and investors’ interests. Lastly, the elimination of liability for adviser misconduct
could reduce or eliminate investor recoveries of losses in connection with misconduct, which
could make such misconduct more likely to occur.
We have also observed some cases where private fund advisers have directly or indirectly
(including through a related person) borrowed from private fund clients.
236 This practice carries
a risk of investor harm because the fund client may be prevented from using borrowed assets to

233 See supra section II.D.3.
234 See supra section II.D.4.
235 See supra section II.D.3.
236 See supra section II.D.6.
194
further the fund’s investment strategy, and so the fund may fail to maximize the investor’s
returns. This risk is relatively higher for those investors that are not able to negotiate or directly
discuss the terms of the borrowing with the adviser, and for those funds that do not have an
independent board of directors or LPAC to review and consider such transactions.237
The staff also has observed harm to investors from disparate treatment of investors in a
fund. For example, our staff has observed scenarios where an adviser grants certain private fund
investors and/or investments in substantially similar pools of assets with better liquidity terms
than other investors.238 These preferential liquidity terms can disadvantage other fund investors
or investors in a substantially similar pool of assets if, for instance, the preferred investor is able
to exit the private fund or pool of assets at a more favorable time.239 Similarly, private fund
advisers, in some cases, disclose information about a private fund’s investments to certain, but
not all, investors in a private fund, which can result in profits or avoidance of losses among those
who were privy to the information beforehand at the expense of those kept in the dark.
240
Currently, many investors need to engage in their own research regarding what terms may be
obtained from advisers, as well as whether other investors are likely to be obtaining better terms
than those they are initially offered.
The staff also has observed harm to investors when advisers lead multiple private funds
and other clients advised by the adviser or its related persons to invest in a portfolio
investment.
241 In those instances, the staff observed advisers allocating fees and expenses

237 Id.
238 See supra section II.E.
239 Id.
240 Id.
241 See supra section II.D.5.
195
among those clients on a non pro rata basis, resulting in some fund clients (and investors in those
funds) being charged relatively higher fees and expenses than other clients.242 Advisers may
make these decisions in order to avoid charging some portion of fees and expenses to funds with
insufficient resources to bear its pro rata share of expenses related to a portfolio investment
(whether due to insufficient reserves, the inability to call capital to cover such expenses, or
otherwise) or funds in which the adviser has greater interests.
We understand that it can be difficult for investors to have full transparency into the
scenarios described above relating to conflicts of interest. For example, the Commission has
pursued enforcement actions against private fund advisers where the adviser failed to inform
investors about benefits that the advisers obtained from accelerated monitoring fees.243 Further,
the Commission also has pursued enforcement actions against private fund advisers in other
circumstances in which investors were not informed of relevant conflicts of interest.244
While our staff has observed that some advisers have begun to more fully disclose sales
practices, conflicts of interests, and compensation schemes to investors and the practices that are
associated with them, we believe that it may be hard even for sophisticated investors with full
and fair disclosure, to understand the future implications of terms and practices related to these
practices at the time of investment and during the investment. Further, some investors may find
it relatively difficult to negotiate agreements that would fully protect them from bearing
unexpected portions of fees and expenses or from other decreases in the value of investments
associated with the above-described practices. For example, some forms of negotiation may

242 Id.
243 See supra footnote 10 (with accompanying text).
244 Id.
196
occur through repeat-dealing that may not be available to some smaller private fund investors.245
For any investors affected by these issues, including potentially sophisticated investors, there
may be mismatches between investor choices of private funds and preferences over private fund
terms, investment strategies, and investment outcomes, relative to what would occur in the
absence of such unexpected or uncertain costs.
Our staff has also observed that investors are generally not provided with detailed
information about these preferential terms.246 This lack of transparency prevents investors from
understanding the scope or magnitude of preferential terms granted, and as a result, may prevent
such investors from requesting additional information on these terms or other benefits that
certain investors, including the adviser’s related persons or large investors, receive. In this case,
these investors may simply be unaware of the types of contractual terms that could be negotiated.
To the extent this lack of transparency affects investor choices of where to allocate their capital,
it can result in mismatches between investor choices of private funds and their preferences over
private fund terms, investment strategies, and investment outcomes.
3. Private Fund Adviser Fee, Expense, and Performance Disclosure
Practices
Current rules under the Advisers Act do not require advisers to provide quarterly
statements detailing fees and expenses (including fees and expenses paid to the adviser and its
related persons by portfolio investments) to private fund clients or to fund investors. The
custody rule does, however, generally require advisers whose private fund clients are not

245 A study of leveraged buyout transactions from 1990-2012 found that accelerated monitoring fees had been
charged in 28 percent of leveraged buyout transactions, representing 15 percent of total fees charged in those
transactions. See Ludovic Phalippou, Christian Rauch, and Marc Umber, Private Equity Portfolio Company
Fees, 129 Journal of Financial Economics, 559-585 (2018).
246 See supra section II.E.
197
undergoing a financial statement audit to have a reasonable basis for believing that the qualified
custodians that maintain private fund client assets provide quarterly account statements to the
fund’s limited partners. Those account statements may contain some of this information, though
in our experience adviser fees and expenses typically are not presented with the level of
specificity the proposed quarterly statement rule would require. In addition, Form ADV Part 2A
(the “brochure”) requires certain information about an adviser’s fees and compensation. For
example, Part 2A, Item 6 of Form ADV requires an adviser to disclose in its brochure whether
the adviser accepts performance-based fees, whether the adviser manages both accounts that are
charged a performance-based fee and accounts that are charged another type of fee, and any
potential conflicts. Although the brochure is not required to be delivered to investors in a private
fund, the information on Form ADV is available to the public, including private fund investors,
through the Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (“IAPD”) website.247 We
understand that many prospective fund investors obtain the brochure and other Form ADV data
through the IAPD public website.
Similarly, there currently are no requirements under current Advisers Act rules for
advisers to provide investors with a quarterly statement detailing private fund performance.
Although our recently adopted marketing rule contains requirements that pertain to displaying
performance information and providing information about specific investments in adviser
advertisements, these requirements do not compel the adviser to provide performance
information to all private fund clients or investors. Rather, the requirements apply when an

247 Advisers generally are required to update disclosures on Form ADV on both an annual basis, or when
information in the brochure becomes materially inaccurate. Additionally, although advisers are not required to
deliver the Form ADV Part 2A brochure to private fund investors, many private fund advisers choose to provide
the brochure to investors as a best practice.
198
adviser chooses to include performance or address specific investments within an
advertisement.248
Within this framework, advisers have exercised discretion in responding to the needs of
private fund investors for periodic statements regarding fees, expenses, and performance or
similar information on their current investments.
249 Broadly, current investors in a fund rely on
this information in determining whether to invest in subsequent funds and investment
opportunities with the same adviser, or to pursue alternative investment opportunities. When
fund advisers raise multiple funds sequentially, they often consider current investors to also be
prospective investors in their subsequent funds, and so may make disclosures to motivate future
capital commitments. This has led to the development of diverse approaches to the disclosure of
fees, expenses, and performance.250 A private fund adviser may agree, contractually or
otherwise, to provide disclosures to a fund investor, and on the details of these disclosures, at the
time of the investment or subsequently. A private fund adviser also may provide such
information in the absence of an agreement. The format, scope and reporting intervals of these
disclosures vary across advisers and private funds.251 Some disclosures provide limited
information while others are more detailed and complex. Investors may, as a result, find it

248 While the marketing rule became effective as of May 4, 2021, the Commission has set a compliance date of
November 4, 2022 (eighteen months following the effective date) to give advisers sufficient time to comply
with the provisions of the amended rules. As a result, while some advisers may have begun to comply with the
marketing rule, some advisers may not currently be in compliance with the marketing rule. As discussed above,
the marketing rule and its specific protections would generally not apply in the context of a quarterly statement.
See supra footnote 62.
249 See supra section II.B.1 (regarding the role of governance mechanisms in the relationship between the fund and
the investors).
250 See, e.g., William W Clayton, Public Investors, Private Funds, and State Law, 72 Baylor Law Review 294 (BYU
Law Research Paper No. 20-13) (July 2020), available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3573773.
251 One observer of the variation in reporting practices across funds has suggested the use of a standardized
template for this purpose. See, e.g., Reporting Template, The Institutional Limited Partners Association,
available at https://ilpa.org/reporting-template/. ILPA is a trade group for investors in private funds.
199
difficult to assess and compare alternative fund investments, which can make it harder to allocate
capital among competing fund investments or among private funds and other potential
investments. Limitations in required disclosures by advisers may therefore result in mismatches
between investor choices of private funds and their preferences over private fund terms,
investment strategies, and investment outcomes.
While a variety of practices are used, as the market for private fund investing has grown,
some patterns have emerged. We understand that most private fund advisers currently provide
current investors with quarterly reporting, and many private fund advisers contractually agree to
provide fee, expense, and performance reporting to current investors.
252 Further, advisers
typically provide information to existing investors about private fund fees and expenses in
periodic financial statements, schedules, and other reports under the terms of the fund
documents.253
However, reports that are provided to investors may report only aggregated expenses, or
may not provide detailed information about the calculation and implementation of any negotiated
rebates, credits, or offsets.254 Investors may use the information that they receive about their
fund investments to monitor the expenses and performance from those investments. Their ability
to measure and assess the impact of fees and expenses on their investment returns depends on
whether, and to what extent, they are able to receive detailed disclosures regarding those fees and
expense and regarding fund performance. Some investors currently do not receive such detailed

252 See supra section II.A.1, II.A.2.
253 Id.
254 See supra section II.A.
200
disclosures, and this reduces their ability to monitor the performance of their existing fund
investment or to compare it with other prospective investments.
In other cases, adviser reliance on exemptions from specific regulatory burdens for other
regulators can lead advisers to make certain quarterly disclosures. For example, while we
believe that many advisers to hedge funds subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) rely on an exemption provided in CFTC Regulation §
4.13 from the requirement to register with CFTC as a “commodity pool operator,” some may
rely on other CFTC exemptions, exclusions or relief. Specifically, we believe that some advisers
registered with the CFTC may operate with respect to a fund in reliance on CFTC Regulation §
4.7, which provides certain disclosure, recordkeeping and reporting relief and to the extent that
the adviser does so, the adviser would be required to, no less frequently than quarterly, prepare
and distribute to pool participants statements that present, among other things, the net asset value
of the exempt pool and the change in net asset value from the end of the previous reporting
period.
In addition, information about advisers’ fees and about expenses is often included in
advisers’ marketing documents, or included in the fund documents. Many advisers to private
equity funds and other funds that would be determined to be illiquid funds under the proposed
rule provide prospective investors with access to a virtual data room for the fund, containing the
fund’s offering documents (including categories of fees and expenses that may be charged), as
well as the adviser’s brochure and other ancillary items, such as case studies.255 These advisers

255 To the extent that a private fund’s securities are offered pursuant to 17 CFR 230.500 through 230.508
(Regulation D of the Securities Act) and such offering is made to an investor who is not an “accredited
investor” as defined therein, that investor must be provided with disclosure documents that generally contain the
same type of information required to be provided in offerings under Regulation A of the Securities Act, as well
as certain financial statement information. See 17 CFR 230.502(b). However, private funds generally do not
offer interests in funds to non-accredited investors.
201
meet the contractual and other needs of investors for updated information by updating the
documents in the data room. Many advisers to funds that would be considered liquid funds
under the proposed rule, such as hedge funds, tend not to use data rooms. They instead take the
approach of sending email or using other methods to convey updated information to investors.
For instance, prior to closing on a prospective investor’s investment, some advisers send out preclosing email messages containing updated versions of these and other documents. While these
data rooms and email communications are therefore limited in their use for disclosing ongoing
fees and expenses over the life of the fund, prospective investors at the start of the life of a fund,
or at or before the time of their investment, may use this information in conducting due
diligence, in deciding whether to seek to negotiate the terms of investment, and ultimately in
deciding whether to invest in the adviser’s fund.
The adviser’s and related persons’ rights to compensation, which are set forth in fund
documents, vary across fund types and advisers and can be difficult to quantify at the time of the
initial investment. For example, advisers of private equity funds generally receive a
management fee (compensating the adviser for bearing the costs relating to the operation of the
fund and its portfolio investment) and performance-based compensation (further incentivizing
advisers to maximize investor value).
256 Performance-based compensation arrangements in
private equity funds typically require that investors recoup capital contributions plus a minimum
annual return (called the “hurdle rate” or “preferred return”), but these arrangements can vary
according to the waterfall arrangement used, meaning that distribution entitlements between the
adviser (or its related persons) and the private fund investors can depend on whether the

256 See supra section II.A.1.
202
proceeds are distributed on a whole-fund (known as European-style) basis or a deal-by-deal
(known as American-style) basis.
257 In the whole-fund (European) case, the fund typically
allocates all investment proceeds to the investors until they recoup 100% of their capital
contributions attributable to both realized and unrealized investments plus their preferred return,
at which point fund advisers typically begin to receive performance-based compensation.258 In
the deal-by-deal (American) case (or modified versions thereof), it is common for investment
proceeds from each portfolio investment to be allocated 100% to investors until investors recoup
their capital contributions attributable to that specific investment, any losses from other realized
investments, and their applicable preferred return, and then fund advisers can begin to receive
performance-based compensation from that investment.259 Under the deal-by-deal waterfall,
advisers can potentially receive performance-based compensation earlier in the life of the fund,
as successful investments can deliver advisers performance-based compensation before investors
have recouped their entire capital contributions to the fund.260

257 See, e.g., David Snow, Private Equity: A Brief Overview, PEI Media (2007), available at
https://www.law.du.edu/documents/registrar/advassign/Yoost_PrivateEquity%20Seminar_PEI%20Media's%20Private%20Equity%20-
%20A%20Brief%20Overview_318.pdf. See also supra footnote 166.
258 Id.
259 Id.
260 Waterfalls (especially deal-by-deal waterfalls) typically have clawback arrangements to ensure that advisers do
not retain carried interest unless investors recoup their entire capital contributions on the whole fund, plus a
preferred return. The result is that total distributions to investors and advisers under the two waterfalls can be
equal (but may not always be), conditional on correct implementation of clawback provisions. In that case, the
key difference in the two arrangements is that deal-by-deal waterfalls result in fund advisers potentially
receiving their performance-based compensation faster. However, some deal-by-deal waterfalls may also
require fund advisers to escrow their performance-based compensation until investors receive their total capital
contributions to the fund plus their preferred return on the total capital contributions. These escrow policies can
help secure funds that may need to be available in the event of a clawback. Id.
203
Management fee compensation figures and performance-based compensation figures are
not widely disclosed or reported,261 but the sizes of certain of these fees have been estimated in
industry and academic literature. For example, one study estimated that from 2006-2015,
performance-based compensation alone for private equity funds averaged $23 billion per year.
262
Private fund fees increase as assets under management increase, and the private fund industry
has grown since 2015, and as a result private equity management fees and performance-based
compensation fees may together currently total over $100 billion dollars in fees per year.263
Private equity represents $4.2 trillion of the $11.5 trillion dollars in net assets under management
by private funds,264 and so total fees across the private fund industry may be over $200 billion
dollars in fees per year.265

estimate of private equity annual returns, which may conservatively be assumed to be approximately 10 percent.

265 For example, hedge fund management fees are currently estimated to typically be 1.4 percent per year and
performance-based compensation is currently estimated to typically be 16.4 percent of hedge fund profits,
approximately consistent with private equity fees. See, e.g. Leslie Picker, Two and Twenty is Long Dead:

In addition, advisers or their related persons may receive a monitoring fee for consulting
services targeted to a specific asset or company in the fund portfolio.
266 Whether they ultimately
retain the monitoring fee depends, in part, on whether the fund’s governing documents require
the adviser to offset portfolio investment compensation against other revenue streams or
otherwise provide a rebate to the fund (and so indirectly to the fund investors).
267 There can be
substantial variation in the fees private fund advisers charge for similar services and
performances.268 Ultimately, the fund (and indirectly the investors) bears the costs relating to the
operation of the fund and its portfolio investments.

Regarding performance disclosure, advisers typically provide information about fund
performance to investors through the account statements, transaction reports, and other reports.

performance of their funds in the private placement memoranda that they provide to prospective
investors.
Many standardized industry methods have emerged that private funds rely on to report
returns and performance.270 However, each of these standardized industry methods has a variety
of benefits and drawbacks, including differences in the information they are able to capture and
their susceptibility to manipulation by fund advisers.
For private equity and other funds that would be determined to be illiquid under the
proposed rules, standardized industry methods for measuring performance must contend with the
complexity of the timing of illiquid investments. One approach that has emerged for computing
returns for private equity and other fund that would be determined to be illiquid funds is the
internal rate of return (“IRR”).
271 As discussed above, an important benefit of IRR that drives its
use is that IRR can reflect the timing of cash flows more accurately than other performance
measures.
272 All else equal, a fund that delivers returns to its investors faster will have a higher
IRR.
However, current use of IRR to measure returns has a number of drawbacks, including an
upward bias in the IRR that comes from a fund’s use of leverage, assumptions about the
reinvestment of proceeds, and a large effect on measured IRR from cash flows that occur early in
the life of the pool. For example, as discussed above, some private equity funds borrow
extensively at the fund level.
273 This can cause IRRs to be biased upwards. Since IRRs are

270 As discussed above, certain factors are currently used for determining how certain types of private funds should
report performance under U.S. GAAP. See supra footnote 71 (with accompanying text).

based in part on the length of time between the fund calling up investor capital and the fund
distributing profits, private equity funds can delay capital call-ups by first borrowing from fundlevel subscription facilities to finance investments.274 This practice has been used by private
equity funds to artificially boost reported IRRs, but investors must pay the interest on the debt
used and so can potentially suffer lower total returns.275
As for reinvestment assumptions, the IRR as a performance measure assumes that cash
proceeds have been reinvested at the IRR over the entire investment period. For example, if a
private equity or other fund determined to be illiquid reports a 50% IRR but has exited an
investment and made a distribution to investors early in its life, the IRR assumes that the
investors were able to reinvest their distribution again at a 50% annual return for the remainder
of the life of the fund.276
Although IRR remains one of the leading standardized methods of reporting returns at
present, these and other drawbacks make IRR difficult as a singular return measure, especially
for investors who likely may not understand the limitations of the IRR metric, and the
differences between IRR and total return metrics used for public equity or registered investment
funds.
Several other measures have emerged for measuring the performance of private equity
and other funds that would be determined to be illiquid under the proposal. These measures
compensate for some of the shortcomings of IRR at the cost of their own drawbacks. Multiple of

invested capital (MOIC), used by private equity funds, is the sum of the net asset value of the
investment plus all the distributions received divided by the total amount paid in. MOIC is
simple to understand in that it is the ratio of value received divided by money invested, but has a
key drawback that, unlike IRR, MOIC does not take into account the time value of money.
Another measure, Public Market Equivalent (“PME”), also used by private equity and other
funds determined to be illiquid, is sometimes used to compare the performance of a fund with the
performance of an index.277 The measure is an estimate of the value of fund cash flows relative
to the value of a public market index. Relative to a given benchmark, differences in PME can
indicate differences in the performance of different private fund investments. However, the
computation of the PME for a fund requires the availability of information about fund cash flows
including their timing and magnitude.
Regardless of the performance measure applied, another fundamental difficulty in
reporting the performance of funds determined to be illiquid is accounting for differences in
realized and unrealized gains. Funds determined to be illiquid funds generally pursue longerterm investments, and reporting of performance before the fund’s exit requires estimating the
unrealized value of ongoing investments.278 There are often multiple methods that may be used
for valuing an unrealized illiquid investment. As discussed above, the valuations of these
unrealized illiquid investments are typically determined by the adviser and, given the lack of
readily available market values, can be challenging. Such methods may rely on unobservable

277 See e.g., Robert Harris, Tim Jenkinson and Steven Kaplan, Private Equity Performance: What Do We Know?,

208
models and other inputs.279 Because advisers are typically evaluated (and, in certain cases,
compensated) based on the value of these illiquid investments, unrealized valuations are at risk
of being inflated, such that fund performance may be overstated.280 Some academic studies have
found broadly that private equity performance is overstated, driven in part by inflated accounting
of ongoing investments.281
Other approaches tend to be used for evaluating the performance of hedge funds and
other liquid funds. In particular, a fund’s alpha is its excess return over a benchmark index of
comparable risk. A fund’s Sharpe ratio is its excess return above the risk-free market rate
divided by the investment’s standard deviation of returns. Many, but not all, hedge funds
disclose these and other performance measures, including net returns of the fund. Many hedge
fund-level performance metrics can be calculated by investors directly using data on the fund’s
historical returns, by either combining with publicly available benchmark index data (in the case
of alpha) or by combining with an estimate of the standard deviation of the fund’s returns (in the
case of the Sharpe ratio). Despite these detailed methods, public data on hedge fund
performance reporting may also be biased, because hedge funds choose whether and when to
make their performance results publicly available.282
While the Commission believes that many advisers currently select from these varying
standardized industry methods in order to prepare and present performance information, the

difficulty in measuring and reporting returns on a basis comparable with respect to risk, coupled
with the potentially high fees and expenses associated with these funds, can present investors
with difficulty in monitoring and selecting their investments. Specifically, without disclosure of
detailed performance measures and accounting for the impact of risk, debt, the varying impact of
realized and unrealized gains, performances across funds can be highly overstated or otherwise
manipulated, and so impossible to compare.283
4. Fund Audits and Fairness Opinions
Currently under the custody rule, some private fund advisers may obtain financial
statement audits as an alternative to the requirement of the rule that an RIA with custody of
client assets obtain an annual surprise examination from an independent public accountant.284
This incentivizes registered private fund advisers to have the financial statements of their private
fund clients audited. Advisers of funds that obtain these audits, regardless of the type of fund,
are thus able to provide fund investors with reasonable assurances of the accuracy and
completeness of the fund’s financial statements and, specifically, that the financial statements are
free from material misstatements.285

283 See, e.g., Ludovic Phalippou and Oliver Gottschalg, The Performance of Private Equity Funds, 22 (4) The
Review of Financial Studies, 1747-1776 (Apr. 2009); Michael Cembalest, Food Fight: An Update on Private
Equity Performance vs. Public Equity Markets, J.P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management (June 28, 2021),

284 See supra section II.B; rule 206(4)-2(b)(4). The staff has stated that, in order to meet the requirements of rule
206(4)-2(b)(4), these financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or, for certain nonU.S. funds and non-U.S. advisers, prepared in accordance with other standards, so long as they contain
information substantially similar to statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, with material
differences reconciled. See Staff Responses to Questions About the Custody Rule, available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/custody_faq_030510.htm
285 See, e.g., AS 2301: The Auditor's Responses to the Risks of Material Misstatement, PCAOB, available at

Also under the custody rule, an adviser’s choice for a fund to obtain an external financial
statement audit (in lieu of a surprise examination) may depend on the benefit of the audit from
the adviser’s perspective, including the benefit of any assurances that an audit might provide
investors about the reliability of the financial statement. The adviser’s choice also may depend
on the cost of the audit, including fees and expenses.
Based on Form ADV data and as shown below, more than 90 percent of the total number
of hedge funds and private equity funds that are advised by RIAs currently undergo a financial
statement audit, though such audits are not necessarily always by a PCAOB-registered
independent public accountant that is subject to regular inspection.
286 Other types of funds
advised by RIAs undergo financial statement audits with similarly high frequency, with the
exception of securitized asset funds, of which fewer than 20 percent are audited according to the
recent ADV data.

286 Rule 206(4)-2(a)(4) requires that an adviser that is registered or required to be registered under Section 203 of
the Act with custody of client assets to obtain an annual surprise examination from an independent public
accountant. An adviser to a pooled investment vehicle that is subject to an annual financial statement audit by a
PCAOB-registered independent public accountant that is subject to regular inspection is not, however, required
to obtain an annual surprise examination if the vehicle distributes the audited financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to the pool’s investors within 120 days of the end of
its fiscal year. See rule 206(4)-2(b)(4).
211
These audits, while currently valuable to investors, do not obviate the issues with fee,
expense, and performance reporting discussed above.287 First, as shown in the table above, not
all funds advised by RIAs currently undergo annual financial statement audits. Second,
statements regarding fees, expenses, and performance tend to be more frequent, and thus more
timely, than audited annual financial statements. Lastly, more frequent fee, expense, and
performance disclosures can include incremental and more granular information that would be
useful to investors and that would not typically be included in an annual financial statement.
288
Regarding fairness opinions, our staff has observed a recent rise in adviser-led secondary
transactions where an adviser offers fund investors the option to sell their interests in the private
fund or to exchange them for new interests in another vehicle advised by the adviser.
289 We
understand that some, but not all, advisers obtain fairness opinions in connection with these
transactions that typically address whether the price offered is fair. These fairness opinions
provide investors with some third-party assurance as a means to help protect participating
investors.
5. Books and Records
The books and records rule includes requirements for recordkeeping to promote, and
facilitate internal and external monitoring of, compliance. For example, the books and records
rule requires advisers registered or required to be registered under Section 203 of the Act to

287 See supra section V.B.3.
288 For example, annual financial statements may not include both gross and net IRRs and MOICs, separately for
realized and unrealized investments, and without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities. Annual
financial statements may also vary in the level of detail provided for portfolio investment-level compensation.

make and keep true, accurate and current certain books and records relating to their investment
advisory businesses, including advisory business financial and accounting records, and
advertising and performance records.290 Advisers are required to maintain and preserve these
records in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than five years from the end of the
fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in an
appropriate office of the investment adviser.
291
6. Documentation of Annual Review Under the Compliance Rule
Under the Advisers Act compliance rule, advisers registered or required to be registered
under Section 203 of the Act must review no less frequently than annually the adequacy of their
compliance policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation. Currently,
there is no requirement to document that review in writing.
292 This rule applies to all investment
advisers, not just advisers to private funds.293 We understand that many investment advisers
routinely make and preserve written documentation of the annual review of their compliance
policies and procedures, even while the compliance rule does not require such written
documentation. Many advisers retain such documentation for use in demonstrating compliance
with the rule during an examination by our Division of Examinations. However, based on staff
experience, we understand that not all advisers make and retain such documentation of the
annual review.

C. Benefits and Costs
1. Overview and Broad Economic Considerations
Private fund investments can be opaque, and we have observed that investors lack
sufficiently detailed information about fund fees and expenses and the preferred terms granted to
certain investors and often lack sufficient transparency into how private fund performance is
calculated. In addition, we have observed that certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and
compensation schemes are either not transparent to investors or can be harmful and have
significant negative effects on private fund returns.
The proposed rules would (a) require registered investment advisers to provide certain
disclosures in quarterly statements to private fund investors, (b) require all investment advisers,
including those that are not registered with the Commission, to make certain disclosures of
preferential terms offered to prospective and current investors, (c) prohibit all private fund
advisers, including those that are not registered with the Commission, from engaging in certain
activities with respect to the private fund or any investor in that private fund, (d) require a
registered private fund adviser to obtain an annual financial statement audit of a private fund and,
in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction, a fairness opinion from an independent
opinion provider, and (e) impose further requirements, including certain requirements that apply
to all fund advisers, to enhance the level of regulatory and other external monitoring of private
funds and other clients.
Without Commission action, private funds and private fund advisers would have limited
abilities and incentives to implement effective reform. First, it may be difficult for private funds
to adopt a common, standardized set of detailed disclosures and practices. This is because
investors and advisers compete and negotiate independently of each other, and also because of
the substantial complexity of information that fund advisers maintain on their funds and may
214
potentially disclose. For example, and as discussed above, developing an industry standard on
fee and expense disclosures would require independent and competing investors and advisers to
determine which of management fees, fund expenses, performance-based compensation,
monitoring fees, and more should be disclosed and at what frequency.294 Investors and advisers
would face substantial costs in developing a single industry standard that encompasses all of the
dimensions considered in this proposal.
Second, fund adviser incentives to develop and implement reforms, such as developing
more detailed disclosures, are limited by principal-agent problems that are inherent to the
relationship between fund advisers and clients.295 Advisers to private funds can potentially
engage in opportunistic behavior (“hold up”) toward the client in which they exploit their
informational advantage or bargaining power over the client, after the client has entered into the
relationship.
296 Advisers may also face scenarios in which they have conflicts of interest
between certain investors and their own interests (or “conflicting arrangements”), reducing their
incentives to act in the investors’ best interests. Advisers may not have sufficient incentives and
abilities to commit to a solution to these problems with existing governance mechanisms. These
problems of information asymmetry and post-contractual hold-up are amplified by the inherent

294 See supra section V.B.3.
295 The relationship between an adviser and its client or a fund and its investor is generally one where the principal
(the client, here a fund) relies on an agent (the investment adviser) to perform services on the principal’s behalf.
See Michael C. Jensen & William H. Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and
Ownership Structure, 3 Journal of Financial Economics 305-360 (1976). To the extent that principals and their
agents do not have perfectly aligned preferences and goals, agents may take actions that increase their wellbeing at the expense of principals, thereby imposing “agency costs” on the principals. Principals may seek
contractual solutions to the principal-agent problem, although these solutions may be limited in the presence of
information asymmetry.
296 The potential for exploitation can be reduced to the extent that investors have strong rights of exit. See, e.g.,
John Morley, The Separation of Funds and Managers: A Theory of Investment Fund Structure and Regulation,
123 (5) Yale Law Journal 1228-1287 (2014), available at
https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/4449/123YaleLJ.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y.
215
discretion that private fund advisers have over what information to disclose to prospective
investors and the complexity of the disclosures that they provide. In addition, the incentives of
advisers to provide investors with transparency are limited and may depend on the investor’s
scale of operations or relationship with the adviser. For example, the adviser of a private fund
may choose not to disclose to smaller investors information regarding the preferred terms that are
granted to larger investors, even when those terms are material to smaller investor’s choices
regarding the fund investment.
297
These issues carry costs and risks of investor harm in financial markets. The relationship
between fund adviser and investor can provide valuable opportunities for diversification of
investments and an efficient avenue for the raising of capital, enabling economic growth that
would not otherwise occur. However, the current opacity of the market can prevent even
sophisticated investors from optimally obtaining certain terms of agreement from fund advisers,
and this can result in investors paying excess costs, bearing excess risk, receiving limited and
less reliable information about investments, and receiving contractual terms that may reduce
their returns relative to what they would obtain otherwise. The proposed rules provide a
regulatory solution that addresses these problems and enhances the protection of investors.
Moreover, the proposed rules do so in a way that does not deprive fund advisers of compensation
for their services: Insofar as the proposed rules shift costs and risks back onto fund advisers, the
rules strengthen the incentives of advisers to manage risk in the interest of fund investors and, in

297 Results from studies of other markets suggest that mandatory disclosures can cause managers to focus more
narrowly on maximizing investor value. See, e.g., Michael Greenstone, Paul Oyer, and Annette VissingJorgensen, Mandated Disclosure, Stock Returns, and the 1964 Security Acts Amendments, 121 (2) The
Quarterly Journal of Economics 399-460 (May 2006).
216
doing so, does not preclude fund advisers from responding by raising prices of services that are
not prohibited and are appropriately, transparently disclosed.
Effects. In analyzing the effects of the proposed rules, we recognize that investors may
benefit from access to more useful information about the fees, expenses, and performance of
private funds. They also may benefit from more intensive monitoring of funds and fund advisers
by third parties, including auditors and persons who prepare assessments of secondary
transactions. Finally, investors may benefit from the prohibition of certain sales practices,
conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes that result in investor harm. We recognize that
the specific provisions of the proposed rules would benefit investors through each of these basic
effects.
More useful information for investors. Investors rely on information from fund advisers
in deciding whether to continue an investment, how strictly to monitor an ongoing investment or
their adviser’s conduct, whether to consider switching to an alternative, whether to continue
investing in subsequent funds raised by the same adviser, and how to potentially negotiate terms
with their adviser on future investments.
298 By requiring detailed and standardized disclosures
across certain funds, the proposal would improve the usefulness of the information that current
investors receive about private fund fees, expenses, and performance, and that both current and
prospective investors receive about preferential terms granted to certain investors. This would
enable them to evaluate more easily the performance of their private fund investments, net of
fees and expenses, and to make comparisons among investments. Finally, enhanced disclosures
would help investors shape the terms of their relationship with the adviser of the private fund.

298 For example, private equity fund agreements often allow the adviser to raise capital for new funds before the
end of the fund’s life, as long as all, or substantially all, of the money in prior fund has been invested. See, e.g.,
Gompers and Lerner (2004) and Morley (2014, at 1254).
217
The rules may also improve the quality and accuracy of information received by investors
through the proposed audit requirement, both by providing independent checks of financial
statements, and by potentially improving advisers’ regular performance reporting, to the extent
that regular audits improve the completeness and accuracy of fund adviser valuation of ongoing
investments.
Enhanced external monitoring of fund investments. Many investors currently rely on
third-party monitoring of funds for prevention and timely detection of specific harms from
misappropriation, theft, or other losses to investors. This monitoring occurs through audits and
surprise exams or audits under the custody rule, as well as through other audits of fund financial
statements. The proposal would expand the scope of circumstances requiring third-party
monitoring, and investors would benefit to the extent that such expanded monitoring increases
the speed of detection of misappropriation, theft, or other losses and so results in more timely
remediation. Audits may also broadly improve the completeness and accuracy of fund
performance reporting, to the extent these audits improve fund valuations of their ongoing
investments. Even investors who rely on the recommendations of consultants, advisers, private
banks, and other intermediaries would benefit from the proposal, to the extent the
recommendations by these intermediaries are also improved by the protections of expanded
third-party monitoring by independent public accountants.
Prohibitions of certain activities that are contrary to public interest and to the protection
of investors. Certain practices, even if appropriately disclosed or permitted by private fund
offering documents, represent potential conflicts of interest and sources of harm to funds and
investors. Because many of these conflicts of interest and sources of harm may be difficult for
investors to detect or negotiate terms over, full disclosure of the activities considered in the
218
proposal would not likely resolve the potential investor harm. Further, as discussed above,
private funds typically lack fully independent governance mechanisms more common to other
markets that would help protect investors from harm in the context of the activities
considered.299 The proposal would benefit investors and serve the public interest by prohibiting
such practices.
The costs of the proposed rules would include the costs of meeting the minimum
regulatory requirements of the rules, including the costs of providing standardized disclosures
and, for some funds, refraining from prohibited activities, and obtaining the required external
financial statement audit and fairness opinions. Additional costs would arise from the new
compliance requirements of the proposed rules. For example, some advisers would update their
compliance programs in response to the requirement to make and keep a record of their annual
review of the program’s implementation and effectiveness. Certain fund advisers may also face
costs in the form of declining revenue, declining in compensation to fund personnel and a
potential resulting loss of employees, or losses of investor capital. However, some of these
costs, such as declining compensation to fund personnel, would be a transfer to investors
depending on the fund’s economic arrangement with the adviser.
Below we discuss these benefits and costs in more detail and in the context of the specific
elements of the proposal.
2. Quarterly Statements
We are proposing to require a registered investment adviser to prepare a quarterly
statement for any private fund that it advises, directly or indirectly, that has at least two full

299 See supra section V.B.1.
219
calendar quarters of operating results, and distribute the quarterly statement to the private fund's
investors within 45 days after each calendar quarter end, unless such a quarterly statement is
prepared and distributed by another person.
300 The rule provides that, to the extent doing so
would provide more meaningful information to the private fund’s investors and would not be
misleading, the adviser must consolidate the quarterly statement reporting to cover, as defined
above, substantially similar pools of assets.
301
We discuss the costs and benefits of this proposal to require a quarterly account statement
below. The Commission notes, however, that it is generally difficult to quantify these economic
effects with meaningful precision, for a number of reasons. For example, there is a lack of
quantitative data on the extent to which advisers currently provide information that would be
required to be provided under the proposed rule to investors. Even if these data existed, it would
be difficult to quantify how receiving such information from advisers may change investor
behavior. In addition, the benefit from the requirement to provide the mandated performance
disclosures would depend on the extent to which investors already receive the mandated
information in a clear, concise, and comparable manner. As discussed above, however, we
believe that the format and scope of these disclosures vary across advisers and private funds,

300 See supra section II.A.
301 See supra section II.A.4.
220
with some disclosures providing limited information while others are more detailed and
complex.
302 As a result, parts of the discussion below are qualitative in nature.
Quarterly Statement – Fee and Expense Disclosure
The proposed rule would require an investment adviser that is registered or required to be
registered and that provides investment advice to a private fund to provide to each of the private
fund investors with a quarterly statement containing certain information regarding fees and
expenses, including fees and expenses paid by underlying portfolio investments to the adviser or
its related persons, is distributed to the fund’s investors. The quarterly statement would include a
table detailing all adviser compensation to advisers and related persons, fund expenses, and the
amount of offsets or rebates carried forward to reduce future payments or allocations to the
adviser or its related persons.
303 Further, the quarterly statement would include a table detailing
portfolio investment compensation and, for portfolio investments in which portfolio investment
compensation was received, certain ownership percentage information.
304 The proposed
quarterly statement rule would require each quarterly statement to be distributed within 45 days,
include clear and prominent, plain English disclosures regarding the manner in which all
expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, waivers, and offsets are calculated, and include crossreferences to the sections of the private fund’s organizational and offering documents that set
forth the applicable calculation methodology.
305
Benefits

302 See supra section V.B.3.
303 See supra section II.A.1.a.
304 See supra section II.A.1.b.
305 See supra section II.A.1.c.
221
The effect of this requirement to provide a standardized minimum amount of information
in an easily understandable format would be to lower the cost to investors of monitoring fund
fees and expenses, lower the cost to investors of monitoring any conflicting arrangements,
improve the ability of investors to negotiate terms related to the governance of the fund, and
improve the ability of investors to evaluate the value of services provided by the adviser and
other service providers to the fund.
For example, investors could more easily compare actual investment returns to the
projections they received prior to investing. As discussed above, any waterfall arrangements
governing fund adviser compensation may be complex and opaque.306 As a result, investor
returns from a fund may be affected by whether investors are able to follow, and verify,
payments that the fund is making to investors and to the adviser in the form of performancebased compensation, as these payments are often only made after investors have recouped the
applicable amount of capital contributions and received any applicable preferred returns from the
fund. This information may also help investors evaluate whether they are entitled to the benefit
of a clawback. This may particularly be the case for deal-by-deal waterfalls, where advisers may
be more likely to be subject to a clawback.307 As discussed above, even sophisticated investors
have reported difficulty in measuring and evaluating compensation made to fund advisers and
determining if adviser fees comply with the fund’s governing agreements.
308 Any such investors
would benefit to the extent that the required disclosures under the proposal address these
difficulties.

306 See supra section V.B.3.
307 Id.
308 See supra footnote 24 (with accompanying text).
222
Investors may also find it easier to compare alternative funds or other investments. As a
result, some investors may reallocate their capital among competing fund investments and, in
doing so, achieve a better match between their choice of private fund and their preferences over
private fund terms, investment strategies, and investment outcomes. For example, investors may
discover differences in the cost of compensating advisers across funds that lead them to move
their assets into funds (if able to do so) with less costly advisers or other service providers.
Investors may also have an improved ability to negotiate expenses and other arrangements in any
subsequent private funds raised by the same adviser. Investors may therefore face lower overall
costs of investing in private funds as a benefit of the standardization. In addition, an investor
may more easily detect errors by reading the adviser’s disclosure of any offsets or rebates carried
forward to subsequent periods that would reduce future adviser compensation. This information
would make it easier for investors to understand whether they are entitled to additional
reductions in future periods.
Because the rule requires disclosures at both the private-fund level and the portfolio level,
investors can more easily evaluate the aggregate fees and expenses of the fund, including the
impact of individual portfolio investments. The private fund level information would allow
investors to more easily evaluate their fund fees and expenses relative to the fund governing
documents, evaluate the performance of the fund investment net of fees and expenses, and
evaluate whether they want to pursue further investments with the same adviser or explore other
potential investments. The portfolio investment level information would allow investors to
evaluate the fees and costs of the fund more easily in relation to the adviser’s compensation and
ownership of the portfolio investments of the fund. For example, investors would be able to
evaluate more easily whether any portfolio investments are providing compensation that could
223
entitle investors to a rebate or offset of the fees they owe to the fund adviser. This information
would also allow investors to compare the adviser’s compensation from the fund’s portfolio
investments relative to the performance of the fund and relative to the performance of other
investments available to the investor. To the extent that this heightened transparency encourages
advisers to make more substantial disclosures to prospective investors, investors may also be
able to obtain more detailed fee and expense and performance data for other prospective fund
investments. As a result of these required disclosures, investor choices over private funds may
more closely match investor preferences over private fund terms, investment strategies, and
investment outcomes.
The magnitude of the effect depends on the extent to which investors do not currently
have access to the information that would be reported in the quarterly statement in an easily
understandable format. While many advisers not required to send quarterly statements choose to
do so anyway, existing quarterly statements are not standardized across advisers and may vary in
their level of detail. For example, we understand that many private equity fund governing
agreements are broad in their characterization of the types of expenses that may be charged to
portfolio investments and that investors receive reports of fund expenses that are aggregated to a
level that makes it difficult for investors to verify that the individual charges to the fund are
justified.
309 Further, as discussed above, we believe that some investors in hedge funds
operating in reliance on the exemption set forth in CFTC Regulation 4.7 may currently receive
quarterly statements that present, among other things, the net asset value of the exempt pool and

309 See, e.g., StepStone, Uncovering the Costs and Benefits of Private Equity (Apr. 2016), available at
https://www.stepstonegroup.com/wpcontent/uploads/2021/07/StepStone_Uncovering_the_Costs_and_Benefits_of_PE.pdf.
224
the change in net asset value from the end of the previous reporting period.310 While this could
have the effect of mitigating some of the benefits of the proposed rule, we do not believe that
reports provided to investors pursuant to CFTC Regulation § 4.7 require all of the information,
nor their standardized presentation, as required under the proposed rule. The magnitude of the
effect also depends on how investors would use the fee and expense information in the quarterly
statement. In addition, reports of fund expenses often do not include data about payments at the
level of portfolio investments, information about the extent to which fees and expenses are
allocated to a given fund versus other similar funds and co-investment accounts, or about how
offsets are calculated, allocated and applied. Lack of disclosure has been at issue in enforcement
actions against fund managers.
311
Costs
The cost of the proposed changes in fee and expense disclosure would include the cost of
compliance by the adviser. For advisers that currently maintain the records needed to generate
the required information, the cost of complying with this new disclosure requirement would be
limited to the costs of compiling, preparing, and distributing the information for use by investors
and the cost of distributing the information to investors. We expect these costs would generally
be ongoing costs. Advisers would also incur costs associated with determining and verifying
that the required disclosures comply with the format requirements under the proposed rule,
including demands on personnel time required to verify that disclosures are made in plain
English regarding the manner in which calculations are made and to verify that disclosures
include cross-references to the sections of the private fund’s organizational and offering

310 See supra section V.B.3.
311 See supra footnotes 25-27 (with accompanying text).
225
documents. This also includes demands on personnel time to verify that the information required
to be provided in tabular format is distributed with the correct presentation. Advisers may also
choose to undertake additional costs of ensuring that all information in the quarterly statements is
drafted consistently with the information in fund offering documents, to avoid inconsistent
interpretations across fund documents and resulting confusion for investors. Many of these costs
we would expect would be borne more heavily in the initial compliance phases of the rule and
would wane on an ongoing basis.
Some of these costs of compliance could be reduced by the rule provision providing that
advisers must consolidate the quarterly statement reporting to cover substantially similar pools of
assets, avoiding duplicative costs across multiple statements. However, in other cases the rule
provision requiring consolidation may further increase the costs of compliance with the proposed
rules, not decrease the costs of compliance. For example, in the case where a private fund
adviser is preparing quarterly statements for investors in a feeder fund, and therefore
consolidating statements between a master fund and its feeder funds, the consolidation may
require the adviser to calculate the feeder fund’s proportionate interest in the master fund on a
consolidated basis. The additional costs of these calculations of proportionate interest in the
master fund, to the extent the adviser does not already undertake this practice, may offset any
reduced costs the adviser receives from not being required to undertake duplicative costs across
multiple statements.
There are other aspects of the rule that would impose costs. The proposed rule would
require each portfolio investment table to list the fund’s ownership percentage of covered
portfolio investments as of the end of the reporting period and impose record-keeping and timing
requirements. The costs associated with implementing this requirement are likely to vary among
226
advisers depending on the current record keeping and disclosure practices of the adviser. These
costs are likely to be initially higher, but could also vary over time. In addition, some advisers
may choose to update their systems and internal processes and procedures for tracking fee and
expense information in order to better respond to this disclosure requirement. The costs of those
improvements would be an indirect cost of the rule, to the extent they would not occur otherwise,
and they are likely to be higher initially than they would be on an ongoing basis.
Preparation and distribution of Quarterly Statements. As discussed below, for purposes
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”), we anticipate that the compliance costs
associated with preparation and distribution of quarterly statements (including the preparation
and distribution of fee and expense disclosure, as well as the performance disclosure discussed
below) would include an aggregate annual internal cost of $200,643,858 and an aggregate annual
external cost of $112,403,250, or a total cost of $313,047,108 annually.
312 For costs associated
with potential upgrades to fee tracking and expense information systems, funds are likely to vary
in the intensity of their upgrades, because for example some advisers may not pursue any system
upgrades at all, and moreover the costs may be pursued or amortized over different periods of
time. Advisers are similarly likely to vary in their choices of whether to invest in increasing the
quality of their services. For both of these categories of costs, the data do not exist to estimate
how funds or investors may respond to the reporting requirements, and so the costs may not be
practically quantified.
Under the proposed rule, these compliance costs may be borne by advisers and, where
permissible, could be imposed on funds and therefore indirectly passed on to investors. For

312 See infra section VI.B. As explained in that section, this estimated annual cost is the sum of the estimated
recurring cost of the proposed rule in addition to the estimated initial cost annualized over the first three years.
227
example, under current practice, advisers to private funds generally charge disclosure and
reporting costs to the funds, so that those costs are ultimately paid by the fund investors. Also,
currently, to the extent advisers use service providers to assist with preparing statements (e.g.,
fund administrators), those costs often are borne by the fund (and thus indirectly investors). To
the extent not prohibited, we expect similar arrangements may be made going forward to comply
with the proposed rule. Advisers could alternatively attempt to introduce substitute charges (for
example, increased management fees) in order to cover the costs of compliance with the rule,
and their ability to do so may depend on the willingness of investors to incur those substitute
charges.
Further, to the extent that the additional standardization and comparability of the
information in the required disclosures makes it more difficult to charge fees higher than those
charged for similar adviser services or otherwise to continue current levels and structures of fees
and expenses, the proposal may reduce revenues for some advisers and their related persons.
These advisers may respond by reducing their fees or by differentiating their services from those
provided by other advisers, including by, for example, increasing the quality of their services in a
manner that could attract additional capital to funds they advise. To the extent these reduced
revenues result in reduced compensation for some advisers and their related persons, those
entities may become less competitive as employers. However, this cost is likely to be mitigated
because some advisers may attract new capital under the proposal, and so those advisers and
their related persons may become more competitive as employers.
Quarterly statement – Performance Disclosure
Advisers would also be required to include standardized fund performance information in
each quarterly statement provided to fund investors. Specifically, the proposed rule would
228
require an adviser to a fund considered a liquid fund under the proposed rule to disclose the
fund’s annual total returns for each calendar year since inception and the fund’s cumulative total
return for the current calendar year as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter covered by
the quarterly statement.
313 For funds determined to be illiquid funds under the proposed rule, the
proposed rule would require an adviser to show the internal rate of return (IRR) and multiple of
invested capital (MOIC) (each, on a gross and net basis), the gross IRR and the gross MOIC for
the unrealized and realized portions of the portfolio (each shown separately), and a statement of
contributions and distributions.
314 Each would be computed without the effect of any fund level
subscription facilities.
315 The statement of contributions and distributions would provide certain
cash flow information for each fund.316 Further, advisers would be required to include clear and
prominent plain English disclosure of the criteria used and assumptions made in calculating the
performance.317
Benefits
As a result of these performance disclosures, some investors would find it easier to obtain
and use information about the performance of their private fund investments. They may, for
example, find it easier to monitor the performance of their investments and compare the
performance of the private funds in their portfolios to each other and to other investments. In
addition, they may use the information as a basis for updating their choices between different
private funds or between private fund and other investments. In doing so, they may achieve a

313 See supra section II.A.2.a.
314 See supra section II.A.2.b.
315 Id.
316 Id.
317 See supra section II.A.2.c.
229
better alignment between their investment choices and preferences. Cash flow information
would be provided in a form that allows investors to compare the performance of the fund (or a
fund investment) with the performance of other investments, such as by computing PME or other
metrics.
We understand that some investors receive the required performance information under
the baseline, independently of the proposed rule. For example, some investors receive
performance disclosures from advisers on a tailored basis. Those investors may not experience
easier access to performance information from the proposal. They may, however, benefit from
standardization of the information in quarterly statements across investors in a fund and across
advisers. For example, the standardization of the data that a fund provides to all of its investors
could benefit some investors by facilitating the development and sharing of tools and methods
for analyzing the data among the various investors of the fund. In addition, to the extent that
investors share the complete, comparable data with consultants or other intermediaries they work
with (as is often current practice to the extent permitted under confidentiality provisions), this
may allow such intermediaries to provide broader views across the private funds market or
segments of the market. This may facilitate better decision making and capital allocation more
broadly.
The required presentation of performance information and the resulting economic
benefits would vary based on whether the fund is determined to be a liquid fund or an illiquid
fund. For example, for private equity and other funds determined to be illiquid funds, investors
would benefit from receiving multiple pieces of performance information, because the
shortcomings discussed above that are associated with each method of measuring performance
make it difficult for investors to evaluate fund performance from any singular piece of
230
performance information alone, such as IRR or MOIC.
318 For hedge funds, the primary benefit
is the mandating of regular reporting of returns by advisers, avoiding any potential biases
associated with hedge funds choosing whether and when to report returns.319 The benefits from
the proposed requirements are therefore potentially more substantial for the funds determined to
be illiquid funds, as the breadth of the performance information that would be required under the
proposal for the private equity and other funds determined to be illiquid funds is designed to
address the shortcomings of individual performance metrics. For both types of funds, because
the factors we propose to use to distinguish between liquid and illiquid funds align with the
current factors for determining how certain types of private funds should report performance
under U.S. GAAP, market participants may be more likely to understand the presentation of
performance.
Costs
The cost of the required performance disclosure by fund advisers would vary according
to the existing practices of the adviser and the complexity of the required disclosure. For
advisers who already (under their current practice) incur the costs of generating the necessary
performance data, presenting and distributing it in a format suitable for disclosure to investors,
and checking the disclosure for accuracy and completeness, the cost would likely be small. In
particular, for those advisers, the cost of the performance disclosure may be limited to the cost of
reformatting the performance information for inclusion in the mandated quarterly report.
However, we understand that some advisers may face costs of changing their performance
tracking or reporting practices under the current rule. Some of these costs would be direct costs

318 See supra section V.B.3.
319 Id.
231
of the rule requirements. Costs of updating an adviser’s internal controls or internal compliance
system to verify the accuracy and completeness of the reported performance information would
be indirect costs of the rule. We expect the bulk of the costs associated with complying with this
aspect of the proposed rules would likely be most substantial initially rather than on an ongoing
basis.320
Some of these costs of compliance could again be affected by the rule provision
providing that advisers must consolidate the quarterly statement reporting to cover substantially
similar pools of assets. These costs of compliance would be reduced to the extent that advisers
are able to avoid duplicative costs across multiple statements, but would be increased to the
extent that advisers must undertake costs associated with calculating feeder fund proportionate
interests in a master fund, to the extent advisers do not already do so.
The required presentation of performance, and the resulting costs, would vary based on
whether the fund is categorized as liquid or illiquid. In particular, for funds determined to be
liquid funds, the cost is mitigated by the limited nature of the required disclosure, as the proposal
requires only annual total returns and cumulative total returns for the current calendar year as of
the end of the most recent calendar quarter covered, while the more detailed required disclosures
for funds determined to be illiquid funds may require greater cost (yielding, as just discussed,
greater benefit).321 For both categories of funds, because the factors we proposed to use to
distinguish between liquid and illiquid funds align with the current factors for determining how
certain types of private funds should report performance under U.S. GAAP, and as a result,

320 The quantification of the direct costs associated with completing performance disclosures is included in the
analysis of costs associated with fee and expense disclosures above.
321 See supra section II.A.2.a and II.A.2.b.
232
market participants may be more familiar with these methods of presenting information, which
may mitigate costs.
Under the proposed rule, these compliance costs may be borne by advisers and, where
permissible, could be imposed on funds and therefore indirectly passed on to investors. For
example, under current practice, advisers to private funds generally charge disclosure and
reporting costs to the funds, so that those costs are ultimately paid by the fund investors.
Similarly, to the extent advisers currently use service providers to assist with performance
reporting (e.g., administrators), those costs are often borne by the fund (and thus investors). To
the extent not prohibited, we expect similar arrangements may be made going forward to comply
with the proposed rule. Advisers could alternatively attempt to introduce substitute charges (for
example, increased management fees) in order to cover the costs of compliance with the rule, but
their ability to do so may depend on the willingness of investors to incur those substitute charges.
Further, to the extent that the additional standardization and comparability of the
information in the required disclosures make it easier for investors to compare and evaluate
performance, the rule may prompt some investors to search for and seek higher performing
investment opportunities. This could reduce the ability for advisers of low-performing funds to
attract additional capital. By the same rationale, the rule may prompt some investors to search
for and seek higher performing investment opportunities, further reducing the ability for advisers
of low-performing funds to attract additional capital.
3. Prohibited Activities and Disclosure of Preferential Treatment
The proposed rules would prohibit a private fund adviser from engaging in certain
activities with respect to the private fund or any investor in that private fund, including (i)
charging certain regulatory and compliance fees and expenses or fees or expenses associated
233
with certain examinations or investigations,
322 (ii) charging fees for certain unperformed
services,323 (iii) certain non-pro rata fee and expense allocations,324 (iv) borrowing money,
securities, or other fund assets, or receiving a loan or an extension of credit, from a private fund
client,325 (v) reducing the amount of any adviser clawback by the amount of certain taxes,
326 (vi)
limiting or eliminating liability for certain adviser misconduct,
327 and (vii) granting an investor
in the private fund or a substantially similar pool of assets preferential terms regarding liquidity
or transparency that the adviser reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect on other
investors in the fund or a substantially similar pool of assets.
328 In addition, we also propose to
prohibit all private fund advisers from providing any other preferential treatment to any investor
in the private fund unless the adviser provides written disclosures to prospective and current
investors.329 These prohibitions would apply to activities of the private fund advisers even if
they are performed indirectly, for example, by an adviser’s related persons, recognizing that the
potential for harm to the fund and its investors arises independently of whether the adviser
engages in the activity directly or indirectly.330
We discuss the costs and benefits of each of these prohibitions and requirements below.
The Commission notes, however, that several factors make the quantification of many of these
economic effects of the proposed amendments and rules difficult. For example, there is a lack of

322 See supra section II.D.2.
323 See supra section II.D.1.
324 See supra section II.D.5.
325 See supra section II.D.6.
326 See supra section II.D.3.
327 See supra section II.D.4.
328 See supra section II.E.
329 Id.
330 See supra section II.D, II.E.
234
data on the extent to which advisers engage in certain of the activities that would be prohibited
under the proposed rules, as well as their significance to the businesses of such advisers. It is,
therefore, difficult to quantify how costly it would be to comply with the prohibitions. Similarly,
it is difficult to quantify the benefits of these prohibitions, because there is a lack of data
regarding how and to what extent the changed business practices of advisers would affect
investors, and how advisers may change their behavior in response to these prohibitions.
Further, there is a lack of data on the frequency with which advisers grant certain investors the
preferential treatment that would be prohibited under the proposed rules, as well as the frequency
with which preferential terms are currently disclosed to other investors, as well as how and to
what extent these disclosures affect investor behavior. As a result, parts of the discussion below
are qualitative in nature.
Certain Fees and Expenses
The proposal would prohibit a private fund adviser from charging the fund for fees or
expenses associated with an examination or investigation of the adviser or its related persons by
any governmental or regulatory authority or for the regulatory and compliance fees and expenses
of the adviser or its related persons.
331 The benefit to investors would be to lower charges on the
funds they have invested in, which could increase returns, and potentially lower the cost of effort
to avoid and evaluate such charges, or a combination of these benefits. To the extent that these
charges, even when disclosed, create adverse incentives for advisers to allocate expenses to the
fund at a cost to the investor, they represent a possible source of investor harm. For example,
when these charges are in connection with an investigation of an adviser, it may not be in the

331 See supra section II.D.2.
235
fund’s best interest to bear the cost of the investigation.
332 These fees may also, even when
disclosed, incentivize advisers to engage in excessive risk-taking, as the adviser will no longer
bear the cost of any ensuing government or regulatory examinations or investigations.333 By
prohibiting this activity, investors would benefit from the reduced risk of having to incur costs
associated with the adviser’s adverse incentives, such as allocating inappropriate expenses to the
fund. Investors would also be able to search across fund advisers knowing that these charges
would not be assessed on any fund, which may lead to a better match between investor choices
of private funds and their preferences over private fund terms, investment strategies, and
investment outcomes. The magnitude of the benefit would to some extent depend on whether
advisers could introduce substitute charges (for example, increased management fees), and the
willingness of investors to incur those substitute charges, for the purpose of making up any
revenue that would be lost to the adviser from the prohibition. However, any such substitute
charges would be more transparent to the investor and would not create the same adverse
incentives as the prohibited charges, and so investors would likely ultimately still benefit.
This prohibition would impose direct costs on advisers from the need to update their
charging and contracting practices to bring them into compliance with the new requirements.
Advisers would also incur costs related to this prohibition, in connection with not being able to
charge private fund clients for the prohibited expenses. In addition, advisers may incur indirect
costs related to adapting their business models in order to identify and substitute non-prohibited

332 Id.
333 Fund adviser fees can allow the adviser to obtain leverage, and thereby gain disproportionately from successes,
encouraging advisers to take on additional risk. See, e.g., Alon Brav, Wei Jiang, and Rongchen Li, Governance
by Persuasion: Hedge Fund Activism and Market-Based Shareholder Influence, European Corporate
Governance Institute – Finance (Working Paper No. 797/2021) (December 10, 2021), available at
https://ssrn.com/abstract=3955116 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3955116.
236
sources of revenue. For example, advisers may identify and implement methods of replacing the
lost charges from the prohibited practice with the other sources of fund revenue. These costs
would likely be transitory.
Further, as discussed above, we understand that certain private fund advisers, most
notably hedge funds and other funds determined to be liquid funds,
334 that utilize a pass-through
expense model where the private fund pays for most, if not all, of the adviser’s expenses in lieu
of being charged a management fee. The proposed rules would likely prohibit certain aspects of
pass-through expense models or other similar models in which advisers charge investors fees
associated with certain of the adviser’s cost of being an investment adviser. These expenses that
would no longer be passed through to the fund could represent additional costs to the fund
adviser, unless the adviser negotiates a new fixed management fee to compensate for the new
costs. In addition, any such fund restructurings that are undertaken would likely impose costs
that would be borne by advisers. The costs may also be borne partially or entirely by the private
funds, to the extent permissible or to the extent advisers are able to compensate for their costs
with substitute charges (for example, increased management fees). These costs would likely be
transitory. In addition, investors may incur costs from this prohibition that take the form of
lower returns from some fund investments, depending on the extent to which the prohibition
limits the adviser’s efficiency or effectiveness in providing the services that generate returns
from those investments. For example, in the case of pass-through expense models, fund advisers
who would have to bear new costs of providing certain services under the prohibition may

334 See, e.g., Welcome To Hedge Funds’ Stunning Pass-Through Fees, Seeking Alpha (January 24, 2017), available
at https://seekingalpha.com/article/4038915-welcome-to-hedge-funds-stunning-pass-through-fees.
237
reduce or eliminate those services from the fund in order to reduce costs, which may be to the
detriment of the fund’s performance or lead to an increase of compliance risk.
Moreover, to the extent that re-structuring a pass-through expense model of a hedge fund
under the proposal diverts the hedge fund’s resources away from the hedge fund’s investment
strategy, this could lead to a lower return to investors in hedge funds. The cost of lower returns
would be mitigated to the extent that investors can distinguish and identify those funds that
require restructuring as to how they collect revenue from investors and use this information to
search for and identify substitute funds that have expense models that do not need to be
restructured under the rule and that do not present the investor with reduced returns as a result of
the rule. Investors would also need to be able to evaluate whether these substitute funds would
be likely to present them with better performance than their current funds. Any such search costs
would be a cost of the rule. As a result, the cost to investors may include a combination of the
cost of lower returns and the cost of avoiding such reductions in returns.
Fees for Unperformed Services
In addition, the proposal would prohibit a private fund adviser from charging a portfolio
investment for monitoring, servicing, consulting or other fees in respect of services that the
adviser does not, or does not reasonably expect, to provide to the portfolio investment, such as
through an accelerated payment. As discussed above, these fees are likely to reflect conflicts of
interest between the fund and the adviser that are difficult for the investor to detect and
mitigate.
335 For example, in receiving the accelerated payment, discussed above, the adviser
imposes a charge for services that it may not provide.336 An adviser also may have an incentive

335 See supra section II.D.1.
336 Id.
238
to cause the fund to exit a portfolio investment earlier than anticipated, which may result in the
fund receiving a lesser return on its investment.
337 Because adviser misconduct in response to
these incentives may be difficult for investors to detect, full disclosure of this practice does not
resolve the conflict of interest. Under the proposed prohibition, investors would be able to
choose among fund advisers and invest knowing that they would not face the costs of such
conflicts of interests, which also may lead to a better match between investor choices of private
funds and their preferences over private fund terms, investment strategies, and investment
outcomes.
Investors would also benefit directly via lower costs from the prohibition through the
elimination of the fees charged to the fund’s portfolio investment.
338 These cost savings could
be partially mitigated, however, to the extent that advisers are using portions of the proceeds
from the accelerated payment to cover costs of services that benefit the fund client.
339
This prohibition would impose direct costs on advisers from the need to update their
charging and contracting practices to bring them into compliance with the new requirements.
Advisers would also incur costs related to this prohibition in connection with not being able to
receive these charges for unperformed services. For example, advisers would incur costs in
connection with not being able to receive the accelerated payments, and as a result, advisers
could attempt to replace the accelerated payments with some new fee or charge. Advisers could,
therefore, incur transitory costs related to adapting their business models in order to identify and
substitute non-prohibited sources of revenue. These costs may be particularly high in the short

337 See supra section II.D.1
338 The portfolio investments themselves may also benefit directly from no longer paying these fees.
339 As discussed above, the proposal would not prohibit an arrangement where the adviser shifts 100% of the
economic benefit of a portfolio investment fee to the private fund investors, whether through an offset, rebate,
or otherwise. See supra section II.D.1.
239
term to the extent that advisers re-negotiate, re-structure and/or revise certain existing deals or
existing economic arrangements in response to this prohibition.
In addition, investors may incur some costs from this prohibition that take the form of
lower returns from certain fund investments, depending on the extent to which the fund adviser’s
loss of revenue from the prohibited activity diverts resources away from the fund’s investment
strategy. For example, the loss of revenue under this prohibition could cause some advisers to
update their portfolio investment strategies, so that they are less reliant on the prohibited fees for
revenue. The advisers could limit their portfolio investments that are reliant on accelerated
payments for revenue, for example. This could lead to a cost to investors in the form of reduced
returns from those investments. Investors could mitigate this cost to the extent that they can
distinguish and identify those funds that require restructuring as to how they collect revenue
from investors and use this information to search for and identify substitute funds that do not
present the investor with reduced returns as a result of the rule. Investors would also need to be
able to evaluate whether these substitute funds would be likely to present them with better
performance than their current funds. These alternative search costs would be a cost of the rule.
As a result, the cost of the prohibition to investors could thus include a combination of the cost
of lower returns and the cost of avoiding such reductions in returns.
Certain Non-Pro Rata Fee and Expense Allocations
The proposal would prohibit a private fund adviser from charging certain fees and
expenses related to a portfolio investment (or potential portfolio investment) on a non-pro rata
basis when multiple private funds and other clients advised by the adviser or its related persons
have invested (or propose to invest) in the same portfolio investment.
340

340 See supra section II.D.5.
240
These non-pro rata fee and expense allocations tend to adversely affect some investors
who are placed at a disadvantage to other investors. We associate these practices and
disadvantages with a tendency towards opportunistic hold-up of investors by advisers, involving
exploitation of an informational or bargaining advantage.341 The disadvantaged investors
currently pay greater than their pro rata shares of fees and expenses. The disparity may arise
from differences in the bargaining power of different investors. For example, a fund adviser may
have an incentive to assign lower than pro rata shares of fees and expenses to larger investors
that bring repeat business to the adviser and correspondingly lower pro rata shares to the smaller
investors paying greater than pro rata shares.
Investors could either benefit or face costs from the resulting revised apportionment of
expenses to the fund they are invested in, based on whether their share of expenses is decreased
or increased under the rule. Investing clients in these portfolio investments paying greater than
pro rata shares of such fees and expenses would benefit as a result of lowered fees. However, to
the extent that a client was previously able to obtain fee and expense allocations at rates less than
a pro rata apportionment, the client could incur higher fee and expense costs in the future.
Investors may not be aware of the extent to which fees are charged on a non pro-rata basis. Even
if disclosed, the complexity of fee arrangements may mean that these arrangements are hard to
follow. More sophisticated investors may be aware that they risk non pro-rata fees, but
nonetheless be harmed by the uncertainty from complex fee arrangements. Fund advisers may

341 See infra (discussing opportunism in the context of certain preferential treatment).
241
face a commitment problem in that they and their clients might be better off if they could commit
to pro-rata arrangements; thus a prohibition could serve as a net benefit to clients and advisers.342
This prohibition would impose direct costs on advisers to updating their charging and
contracting practices to bring them into compliance with the new requirements. These
compliance costs may be particularly high in the short term to the extent that advisers renegotiate, re-structure, and/or revise certain existing deals or existing economic arrangements in
response to this prohibition. Advisers may face additional costs in the form of lower expenses
and fees, to the extent that less flexible pro-rata fee and expense allocations result in lower
average fees and expenses to the adviser or are more costly to administer and monitor.
Borrowing
The proposal prohibits an adviser, directly or indirectly, from borrowing money,
securities, or other fund assets, or receiving a loan or an extension of credit, from a private fund
client.
343 In cases where, as the Commission has observed, fund assets were used to address
personal financial issues of one of the adviser’s principals, used to pay for the advisory firm’s
expenses, or used in association with any other harmful conflict of interest, 344 then this
prohibition would increase the amount of fund resources available to further the fund’s
investment strategy. Investors would benefit from any resulting increased payout. In addition,
investors would benefit from the elimination or reduction of any need to engage in costly
research or negotiations with the adviser to prevent the uses of fund resources by the adviser that
would be prohibited. The prohibition also has the potential to benefit investors by reducing

342 In a related setting, ex ante commitment to a financing policy has been argued to raise value and lower the cost
of capital. See Peter DeMarzo, Presidential Address, Collateral and Commitment, Journal of Finance, (July 15
2019).
343 See supra section II.D.6.
344 Id.
242
moral hazard: if an adviser borrows from a private fund client and does not pay back the loan, it
is the investors who bear the cost, providing the adviser with incentives to engage in potentially
excessive borrowing.
Advisers may experience costs as a result of this prohibition related to any marginal
increases in the cost of capital incurred from new sources of borrowing, as compared to what
was being charged by the fund.
Reducing Adviser Clawbacks for Taxes
The proposed rule would prohibit certain uses of fund resources by the private fund
adviser by prohibiting advisers from reducing the amount of their clawback obligation by actual,
potential, or hypothetical taxes applicable to the adviser, its related persons, or their respective
owners or interest holders.
345 Some investors would benefit from this rule from effectively
increasing clawbacks (and thus investor returns) by actual, potential, or hypothetical tax rates.
Investors would also benefit from the elimination or reduction of any need to engage in costly
research or negotiations with the adviser to prevent these uses of fund resources by the adviser.
These benefits would likely be more widespread, as such research or negotiations may have been
necessary at the start of fund lives even in cases where investor returns were not ultimately
impacted by tax treatments of clawbacks. Advisers, however, may be unable to recoup the cost
of the tax payments made in connection with the excess distributions and allocations affected by
the rule, and therefore would face greater costs when clawbacks do occur under the prohibition.
This prohibition would impose direct costs on advisers of updating their charging and
contracting practices to bring them into compliance with the new requirements. Advisers may
also attempt to mitigate the greater costs of clawbacks under the prohibition by introducing some

345 See supra section II.D.3.
243
new fee, charge, or other contractual provision that would make up for the lost tax reduction on
the clawback, and they would then incur costs of updating their contracting practices to introduce
these new provisions.
Advisers may attempt to mitigate their increased costs associated with clawbacks by
reducing the risk of a clawback occurring. For example, certain advisers may adopt new
waterfall arrangements designed to delay carried interest payments until later in the life of a
fund, in order to limit the possibility of a clawback or reduce the possible sizes of clawbacks. In
this case, investors would benefit from earlier distributions of proceeds from the fund and
reduced costs associated with monitoring their potential need for a clawback. However, some
fund advisers are able to attract investors even though their fund terms do not provide for full or
partial clawbacks. To the extent such advisers were able to update their business practices, for
example by providing for an advance on tax payments with no option for a clawback, this would
reduce the benefit of the proposal, as investors would continue to receive the reduced clawback
amounts and bear portions of the adviser’s tax burden. In either case, advisers would also bear
additional costs from the proposal of updating their business practices.
Advisers could, therefore, incur transitory costs related to adapting their business models
in order to identify and substitute non-prohibited sources of revenue. These direct costs may be
particularly high in the short term to the extent that advisers re-negotiate, re-structure, and/or
revise certain existing deals or existing economic arrangements in response to this prohibition.
Limiting or Eliminating Liability for Adviser Misconduct
In addition, the proposal would prohibit an adviser to a private fund, directly or
indirectly, from seeking reimbursement, indemnification, exculpation, or limitation of its liability
by the private fund or its investors for a breach of fiduciary duty, willful misfeasance, bad faith,
244
negligence, or recklessness in providing services to the private fund.
346 These practices, even
when disclosed and permissible under state law, may involve breaches of fiduciary duty to the
fund or investors, and possible harms to investors, and so investors will likely benefit from their
prohibition. For example, because investors may be unable to anticipate willful malfeasance by
their fund advisers, they may be unable to anticipate the costs associated with an adviser seeking
reimbursement for its malfeasance, even if the adviser discloses that possibility.
347 Investors
would therefore benefit from the elimination of fund expenses, which would otherwise reduce
investor returns, associated with reimbursing or indemnifying the adviser for losses associated
with its malfeasance. These benefits may be diminished to the extent that advisers are able to
obtain alternative permissible sources of compensation for these expenses from investors (for
example, from increased management fees), although this ability would likely be limited.
Further, these contractual clauses may lead investors to believe that they do not have any
recourse in the event of such a breach. To the extent that any such investors do not seek
damages under this belief, the contractual clauses eliminating liability for breach of fiduciary
duty would represent a harm to the investors. By prohibiting these scenarios, this proposal could
make such breaches of fiduciary duty incrementally less likely to occur. Investors would
therefore benefit from a reduced need to engage in costly research or negotiations with the
adviser to prevent such breaches.
Certain Preferential Terms
The proposal would prohibit a private fund adviser from providing certain preferential
terms to some investors that have a material negative effect on other investors in the private fund

346 See supra section II.D.4.
347 Id.
245
or in a substantially similar pool of assets. We associate these practices with a tendency towards
opportunistic hold-up of investors by advisers, involving the exploitation of an informational or
bargaining advantage by the adviser or advantaged investor.
348 The proposal would prohibit a
private fund adviser and its related persons from granting an investor in the private fund or in a
substantially similar pool of assets the ability to redeem its interest on terms that the adviser
reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect on other investors in that private fund or in
a substantially similar pool of assets.
349 In addition, the proposal would prohibit an adviser and
its related persons from providing information regarding the private fund’s or a substantially
similar pool of asset’s portfolio holdings or exposures to an investor that the adviser reasonably
expects that providing the information would have a material, negative effect on other investors
in that private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets.350
Benefits may accrue from these prohibitions in two situations. First, the prohibitions may
benefit the non-preferred investors in situations where advisers lack the ability to commit to
avoid the opportunistic behavior after entering into the agreement (or relationship) with the
investor. For example, similar to the case regarding non-pro rata fee and expense allocations, an
adviser with repeat business from a large investor with early redemption rights and smaller
investors with no early redemption rights may have adverse incentives to take on extra risk, as
the adviser’s preferred investor could exercise its early redemption rights to avoid the bulk of
losses in the event an investment begins to fail. The adviser would then continue to receive

348 See supra section II.E.
349 Id.
350 Id.
246
repeat business with the investors with preferential terms, to the detriment of the investors with
no preferential terms.
Investors who do receive preferential terms may also receive information over the course
of a fund’s life that the investors can use to their own gain but to the detriment of the fund and,
by extension, the other investors. For instance, if a fund was heavily invested in a particular
sector and an investor with early redemption rights learned the sector was expected to suffer
deterioration, that investor could submit a redemption request, securing their funds early but
forcing the fund to sell assets in a declining market, harming the other investors. In this
situation, the prohibitions would provide a solution to the hold-up problem that is not currently
available. The rule would benefit the disadvantaged investors by prohibiting such a situation,
and so the disadvantaged investors would be less susceptible to hold-up and experience better
performance on their fund investments as a benefit of the proposed rule.
Second, in situations where investors face uncertainty as to whether the adviser engages
in the prohibited practice, the benefit from the prohibition would be to eliminate the costs to
investors of avoiding entering into agreements with advisers that engage in the practice and the
costs to investors from inadvertently entering into such agreements.
Specifically, in this second case, the prohibited preferential terms would harm investors
in private funds and cause investors to incur extra costs of researching fund investments to avoid
fund investments in which the prospective fund adviser engages in these practices (or costs of
otherwise avoiding or mitigating the harm to those disadvantaged investors from the practice).
The benefit of the prohibition to investors would be to eliminate such costs. It would prohibit
disparities in treatment of different investors in substantially similar pools of assets in the case
where the disparity is due to the adviser placing their own interests ahead of the client’s interests
247
or due to behavior that may be deceptive. Investors would benefit from the costs savings of no
longer needing to evaluate whether the adviser engages in such practices. Investors and advisers
also may benefit from reduced cost of negotiating the terms of a fund investment. Investors who
would have been harmed by the prohibited practices would benefit from the elimination of such
harms through their prohibition.
The cost of the prohibitions would depend on the extent to which investors would
otherwise obtain such preferential terms in their agreements with advisers and the conditions
under which they make use of the preferential treatment. Investors who would obtain and make
use of the preferential terms would incur a cost of losing the prohibited redemption and
information rights. This would include any investors who might benefit from the ability to
redeem based on negotiated exceptions to the private fund’s stated redemption terms, in addition
to the investors who might benefit from the hold-up problems discussed above. In addition,
advisers would incur direct costs of updating their processes for entering into agreements with
investors, to accommodate what terms could be effectively offered to all investors once the
option of preferential terms to certain investors has been removed. These direct costs may be
particularly high in the short term to the extent that advisers re-negotiate, re-structure and/or
revise certain existing deals or existing economic arrangements in response to this prohibition.
To the extent advisers respond to the prohibition by developing new preferential terms
and disclosing them to all investors, there may be new costs to investors who do not receive
these new preferential terms. As discussed below, such costs would be mitigated by the
prohibition of such preferential terms unless appropriately disclosed.
Prohibition of Other Preferential Treatment Without Disclosure
248
The proposed rule also would prohibit other preferential terms unless the adviser provides
certain written disclosures to prospective and current investors, and these disclosures must
contain information regarding all preferential treatment the adviser provides to other investors in
the same fund.
351 This would reduce the risk of harm that some investors face from expected
favoritism toward other investors, and help investors understand the scope of preferential terms
granted to other investors, which could help investors shape the terms of their relationship with
the adviser of the private fund. Because these disclosures would need to be provided to
prospective investors prior to their investments and to current investors annually, these
disclosures would help investors shape the terms of their relationship with the adviser of the
private fund. This may lead the investor to request additional information on other benefits to be
obtained, such as co-investment rights, and would allow an investor to understand better certain
potential conflicts of interest and the risk of potential harms or other disadvantages.
Disclosures of such preferential treatment would impose direct costs on advisers to
update their contracting and disclosure practices to bring them into compliance with the new
requirements, including by incurring costs for legal services. These direct costs may be
particularly high in the short term to the extent that advisers re-negotiate, re-structure and/or
revise certain existing deals or existing economic arrangements in response to this prohibition.
However, these costs may also be reduced by an adviser’s choice between not providing the
preferential terms and continuing to provide the preferential terms with the required disclosures,
as the costs to some advisers from not providing the preferential terms to investors may be lower
than the costs from the disclosure.

351 See supra section II.E.
249
As discussed below, for purposes of the PRA, we anticipate that the disclosure of
preferential treatment would impose an aggregate annual internal cost of $128,902,375 and an
aggregate annual external cost of $32,550,000, or a total cost of $161,452,375 annually.
352 To
the extent that advisers are not prohibited from categorizing all or a portion of these costs as
expenses to be borne by the fund, then these costs may be borne indirectly by investors to the
fund instead of advisers.
To the extent that these disclosures could discourage advisers from providing certain
preferential terms in the interest of avoiding future negotiations with other investors on similar
terms, this prohibition could ultimately decrease the likelihood that some investors are granted
preferential terms. As a result, some investors may find it harder to secure such terms.
4. Audits, Fairness Opinions, and Documentation of Annual
Review of Compliance Programs
The proposed audit rule would require an investment adviser that is registered or required
to be registered to cause each private fund that it advises, directly or indirectly, to undergo a
financial statement audit that meets certain elements at least annually and upon liquidation, if the
private fund does not otherwise undergo such an audit. These audits would need to be performed
by an independent public accountant that meets certain standards of independence and is
registered with and subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB, and the statements would need
to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or, for foreign private funds, must contain
information substantially similar to statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, with

352 See infra section VI.E. As explained in that section, this estimated annual cost is the sum of the estimated
recurring cost of the proposed rule in addition to the estimated initial cost annualized over the first three years.
250
material differences with U.S. GAAP reconciled.
353 The rule would also require that auditors
notify the Commission in certain circumstances.
In addition, the rule would require advisers to obtain fairness opinions from an
independent opinion provider in connection with certain adviser-led secondary transactions with
respect to a private fund. This requirement would not apply to advisers that are not required to
register as investment advisers with the Commission, such as state-registered advisers and
exempt reporting advisers. In connection with this fairness opinion, the proposal would also
require a summary of any material business relationships the adviser or any of its related persons
has, or has had within the past two years, with the independent opinion provider. The proposal
would lastly require all advisers, not just those to private funds, to document the annual review
of their compliance policies and procedures in writing.
We discuss the costs and benefits of these rule provisions below. The Commission notes,
however, several factors make the quantification of many of the economic effects of the
proposed amendments and rules difficult. For example, there is a lack of quantitative data on the
extent to which adviser-led secondaries without fairness opinions differ in fairness of price from
adviser-led secondaries with fairness opinions attached. It would also be difficult to quantify
how investors and advisers may change their preferences over secondary transactions once
fairness opinions are required to be provided. As a result, parts of the discussion below are
qualitative in nature.
Benefits
We recognize that many advisers already provide audited fund financial statements to
fund investors in connection with the adviser’s alternative compliance with the custody rule.

353 Id.
251
However, to the extent that an adviser does not currently have its private fund client undergo a
financial statement audit, investors would receive more reliable information from private fund
advisers as a result of the proposed audit rule. The benefit to investors in securitized asset funds
may be relatively greater from the proposal, given the relatively lower frequency with which
securitized asset funds currently undergo financial statement audits.354
The audit requirement would provide an important check on the adviser’s valuation of
private fund assets, which often serve as the basis for the calculation of the adviser’s fees. These
audits would likely detect valuation irregularities or errors, as well as an investment adviser’s
loss, misappropriation, or misuse of client investments. It may thereby limit some opportunities
for advisers to materially over-value investments. Audits provide substantial benefits to private
funds and their investors because audits also test other assertions associated with the investment
portfolio (e.g., completeness, existence, rights and obligations, presentation). Audits may also
provide a check against adviser misrepresentations of performance, fees, and other information
about the fund. Enhanced and standardized regular auditing may therefore broadly improve the
completeness and accuracy of fund performance reporting, to the extent these audits improve
fund valuations of their ongoing investments.
Investors who are not currently provided with audited fund financial statements, and who
would be under the proposal, may, as a result, have additional confidence in information
regarding their investments and, in turn, the fees being paid to advisers. Further, this additional
confidence may facilitate investors’ capital allocation decisions. Anticipating a lower risk of
harm from a private fund investment, investors may be more likely to invest in private funds and
participate in the resulting returns.

354 See supra section V.B.4.
252
As discussed above, currently not all financial statement audits are necessarily conducted
by a PCAOB-registered independent public accountant that is subject to regular inspection.
355
The proposed audit rule’s requirement that the independent public accountant performing the
audit be registered with, and subject to regular inspection by, the PCAOB, is likely to improve
the audit and financial reporting quality of private funds.
356 Higher quality audits generally have
a greater likelihood of detecting material misstatements due to fraud or error, and we further
believe that investors would likely have relatively greater confidence in the quality of audits
conducted by an independent public accountant registered with, and subject to regular inspection
by, the PCAOB.357 Lastly, we believe that the proposed audit rule’s requirement to promptly
distribute the audited financial statements to current investors would allow investors to evaluate
the audited financial information in the audit in a timely manner.
In addition, investors would benefit from enhanced regulatory oversight as a result of the
requirement for the adviser to engage the auditor to notify the Commission under some
conditions.358 The proposed requirement for the auditor to report terminations and modified
opinions privately to the SEC would enable the SEC to receive more timely, complete, and
independent information in these circumstances and to evaluate the need for an examination of

355 See supra section V.B.4.
356 See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement Inspection Process—Preliminary
Evidence, 93 (4) The Accounting Review 53-80 (2018) (concluding that “engagement-specific PCAOB
inspections influence non-inspected engagements, with spillover effects detected at both partner and office
levels” and that “the information communicated by the PCAOB to audit firms is applicable to non-inspected
engagements”); Daniel Aobdia, The Economic Consequences of Audit Firms’ Quality Control System
Deficiencies, 66 (7) Management Science (July 2020) (concluding that “common issues identified in PCAOB
inspections of individual engagements can be generalized to the entire firm, despite the PCAOB claiming that
its engagement selection process targets higher-risk clients” and that “[PCAOB quality control] remediation
also appears to positively influence audit quality”).
357 Id.
358 This requirement does not exist under the custody rule, and as a result, the benefits and costs associated with
this requirement would extend to even those investors and funds for which advisers are already distributing
audits under the custody rule.
253
the adviser. As a result, the SEC would be able to allocate its resources more efficiently. This
could lead to a higher rate of detection of fund adviser activities that lead to harms from
misstatements and a greater potential for mitigation of such harms. Anticipating this, fund
advisers would have stronger incentives to avoid such harmful activities.
The proposal’s requirement that an adviser distribute a fairness opinion and summary of
material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with certain adviser-led
secondary transactions may provide similar increases in investor confidence in the specific
context of adviser-led secondary transactions. This requirement would provide an important
check against an adviser’s conflicts of interest in structuring and leading these transactions.
Investors would have decreased risk of experiencing harm from mis-valuation of secondary-led
transactions. Further, anticipating a lower risk of harm from mis-valuation when participating in
such transactions, investors may be more likely to participate. The result may be a closer
alignment between investor choices and investor preferences over private fund terms, investment
strategies, and investment outcomes. These benefits would, however, be reduced to the extent
that advisers are already obtaining fairness opinions as a matter of best practice.
Finally, this proposed rule amendment would require all SEC-registered advisers to
document the annual review of their compliance policies and procedures in writing. This would
allow our staff to better determine whether an adviser has complied with the review requirement
of the compliance rule, and would facilitate remediation of non-compliance. Because our staff’s
determination of whether the adviser has complied with the compliance rule will become more
effective, the rule may reduce the risk of non-compliance, as well as any risk to investors
associated with non-compliance.
254
These benefits from mandatory audits and fairness opinions are particularly relevant for
illiquid investments. Illiquid assets currently are where we believe it is most feasible for
financial information to have material misstatements of investment values, for adviser-led
secondary transactions to occur at unfair prices, and where there is broadly a higher risk of
investor harm from potential conflicts of interest or fraud. This is because currently, as
discussed above, advisers may use a high level of discretion and subjectivity in valuing a private
fund’s illiquid investments, and the adviser further may have incentives to bias the fair value
estimates of the investment upwards in order to generate larger fees.359 Because both funds
determined to be liquid funds and illiquid funds may have illiquid investments, investors in both
types of funds will benefit, though the benefits may be larger for investors in illiquid funds (as
such funds may have more illiquid investments than liquid funds and are more likely to have
adviser-led secondary transactions). The benefits from documentation of compliance programs
will be relevant for all investors, as the rule applies to all fund advisers, not just private fund
advisers.
Costs
As discussed above, we recognize that many advisers already provide audited financial
statements to fund investors in connection with the adviser’s alternative compliance with the
custody rule.
360 To the extent that an adviser does not currently have its private fund client
undergo the required financial statement audit, there would be direct costs of obtaining the
auditor, providing the auditor with resources needed to conduct the audit, the audit fees, and
promptly distributing the audit results to current investors. We recognize that the proposed audit

359 See supra section II.B.
360 See supra section V.B.4.
255
rule’s requirement to promptly distribute the audited financial statements to current investors
after the audit’s completion may also impose compliance costs, which would be mitigated by the
flexibility of the proposal’s requirement for prompt distribution, relative to a requirement for
distribution to occur by a a specific deadline. Under current practice, the costs of undergoing a
financial statement audit are often paid by the fund, and therefore, ultimately, by the fund
investors, though in some cases the costs may be partially or fully paid by the adviser. To the
extent not prohibited, we expect similar arrangements may be made going forward to comply
with the proposed rule: in some instances, the fund will bear the audit expense, in others the
adviser will bear it, and there also may be arrangements in which both the adviser and fund will
share the expense.361 Advisers could alternatively attempt to introduce substitute charges (for
example, increased management fees) in order to cover the costs of compliance with the rule, but
their ability to do so may depend on the willingness of investors to incur those substitute charges.
As discussed below, based on Form ADV filings, as of November 30, 2021, there were
5,037 registered advisers providing advice to private funds, and we estimate that these advisers
would, on average, each provide advice to 9 private funds.
362 We further estimate that the audit
fee for the required private fund audit would be $60,000 per fund on average.
363 For purposes of
the PRA, the estimated total auditing fees for all funds would therefore be approximately $2,720
million annually.
364 We further anticipate that the audit requirement would impose for all funds

361 See infra section VI.C.
362 See infra section VI.C.
363 See infra footnote 420. The audit fee for an individual fund may be higher or lower than this estimate, with
individual fund audit fees varying according to fund characteristics, such as the jurisdiction of the assets,
complexity of the holdings, the firm providing the services, and economies of scales.
364 See infra section VI.C.
256
approximately 92,479.32 hours of internal annual burden hours and a cost of approximately
$27.6 million for internal time.365 However, some funds would obtain the required financial
statement audits in the absence of the proposal. The cost of the proposed audit requirement
would therefore depend on the extent to which funds currently receive audits and, if so, whether
their auditors are registered with the PCAOB.
For example, all or a portion of the costs described in this section may be
disproportionately borne by advisers or investors (or both) to securitized asset funds,366 given
that fewer securitized asset funds currently undergo financial statement audits than other
categories of funds.367 We believe that the costs incurred may approximate 10% of these
amounts, because across all types of funds, approximately 90% of funds are currently audited in
connection with the fund adviser’s alternative compliance under the custody rule.368 However,
because a large portion of funds who do not currently undergo financial statement audits are
securitized asset funds, to the extent that audits for securitized asset funds are more costly than
for other fund types (for example, if it is more burdensome to audit financial statements that
primarily contain securitized assets), then the costs of the proposal may be greater than 10% of
the amounts described above.
For advisers that had been complying with the surprise examination requirement of the
custody rule and do not have other clients (e.g., separately managed accounts) for which a
surprise exam must be obtained, the costs of the audit performed in accordance with the

365 Id.
366 As noted above, to the extent not prohibited, we expect that in some instances, the fund will bear the audit
expense, in others the adviser will bear it, and there also may be arrangements in which both the adviser and
fund will share the expense.
367 See supra section V.B.4.
368 Id.
257
proposed audit rule would be offset by the reduction in costs from no longer obtaining a surprise
examination. To the extent that audits cost more than surprise examinations, the offset may be
only partial, and to the extent that an adviser must continue to undergo a surprise examination
because it has custody of non-private fund client funds and securities, there likely would be no
offset. For funds that had received an audit by an auditor that is not registered with the PCAOB,
the costs of the audit performed in accordance with the proposed audit rule would also be offset
by the reduction in costs from no longer obtaining their previous audit, although we anticipate
that the cost of the required audit would likely be greater because a PCAOB-registered and -
inspected auditor may cost more than an auditor that is not subject to the same level of PCAOB
oversight.
We also understand that the PCAOB registration and inspection requirement may limit
the pool of auditors that are eligible to perform these services which could, in turn, increase
costs, as a result of the potential for these auditors to charge higher prices for their services. The
increase in demand for these services, however, may be limited in light of the high percentage of
funds already being audited.369 The Commission notification requirement of the proposed audit
rule would represent a new cost, regardless of whether their private fund clients are already
undergoing a financial statement audit. We anticipate that accounting firms would increase their
fees as a result of this new obligation and perceived liability. For advisers who had been
undergoing a surprise examination for purposes of the custody rule, there may not be as great of
an increase in costs in light of similar requirements in connection with those examinations under
that rule.

369 Id.
258
The indirect costs of the independent audit requirement would depend on the quality of
the financial statements of the funds newly subject to audits. These costs may be relatively
higher for the funds with lower quality financial statements (i.e., the funds with the greatest
benefit from the audit requirement). The indirect costs from the independent audit requirement
may include costs of changing the fund’s internal financial reporting practices, such as
improvements to internal controls over financial reporting, to avoid potential harm to investors
from a misstatement. Further, we understand that the requirement to have the auditor registered
with, and subject to the regular inspection by, the PCAOB may limit the pool of accountants that
are eligible to perform these services because only those accountants that conduct public
company issuer audits are subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB.370 The resulting
competition for these services might generally lead to an increase in their costs, as an effect of
the proposal.
Costs would also be incurred related to obtaining the required fairness opinion and
material business relationship summary in the case of an adviser-led secondary transaction. For
purposes of the PRA, we estimate that 10% of advisers providing advice to private funds conduct
an adviser-led secondary transaction each year and that the funds would pay external costs of
$40,849 for each fairness opinion and material business relationship summary.
371 Because only
approximately 10 percent of advisers conduct an adviser-led secondary transaction each year, the

370 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorizes the PCAOB to inspect registered firms for the purpose of assessing
compliance with certain laws, rules, and professional standards in connection with a firm's audit work for public
company and broker-dealer clients. However, the PCAOB currently has only a temporary inspection program
for broker-dealer clients.
371 See infra section VI.D; footnote 430. The fairness opinion fee for an individual fund may be higher or lower
than this estimate, with individual fund audit fees varying according to the complexity, terms, and size of the
adviser-led secondary transaction, as well as the nature of the assets of the fund.
259
estimated total fees for all funds per year would therefore be approximately $20.6 million.
372
Further, as discussed in section VI.D below, we anticipate that the fairness opinion and material
business relationship summary requirements would impose approximately 3,528 hours of
internal annual burden hours and a cost of approximately $1,219,499 for internal time
annually.
373 These costs will be borne primarily, though not exclusively, by closed-end funds
determined to be illiquid funds,374 as these are the funds that most frequently have the adviserled secondaries considered by the rule. To the extent that certain hedge fund transactions are
captured by the rule, these funds and their investors would also face comparable fees and costs.
The costs associated with obtaining fairness opinions could dissuade some private fund
advisers from leading these transactions, which could decrease liquidity opportunities for some
private fund advisers. Under current practice, some investors bear the expense associated with
obtaining a fairness opinion if there is one. To the extent not prohibited, we expect similar
arrangements may be made going forward to comply with the proposed rule. Advisers could
alternatively attempt to introduce substitute charges (for example, increased management fees) in
order to cover the costs of compliance with the rule, but their ability to do so may depend on the
willingness of investors to incur those substitute charges.
In addition, the required documentation of the annual review of the fund compliance
program has direct costs that include the cost of legal services associated with the preparation of
such documentation. As discussed below, for purposes of the PRA, we anticipate that the
requirement for all SEC-registered advisers to document the annual review of their compliance

372 See supra section II.C; see also infra section VI.D.
373 See infra section VI.D.
374 See supra section II.C.
260
policies and procedures in writing would, for all advisers, impose 44,496 hours of internal annual
burden hours at a cost of approximately $18.9 million for internal time, and approximately $4.1
million for external costs.
375
5. Recordkeeping
Finally, the proposed amendment to the recordkeeping rule would require advisers who
are registered or required to be registered to retain books and records related to the proposed
quarterly statement rule,
376 to retain books and records related to the mandatory adviser audit
rule,377 to support their compliance with the proposed adviser-led secondaries rule,
378 and to
support their compliance with the proposed preferential treatment disclosure rule.379 The benefit
to investors would be to enable an examiner to verify more easily that a fund is in compliance
with these proposed rules and to facilitate the more timely detection and remediation of noncompliance. These requirements would also help facilitate the Commission’s enforcement and
examination capabilities. Also beneficial to investors, advisers may react to the enhanced ability
of third parties to detect and impose sanctions against non-compliance due to the recordkeeping
requirements by taking more care to comply with the substance of the rule.
These requirements would impose costs on advisers related to maintaining these records.
As discussed below, for purposes of the PRA, we anticipate that the additional recordkeeping
obligations would impose, for all advisers, 40,800 hours of internal annual burden hours and that
the annual cost would be approximately $2.8 million.
380

375 See infra section VI.F.
376 See supra section II.A.5.

378 See supra section II.C.1.
379 See supra section II.E.1.
380 See infra section VI.G.
261
D. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
1. Efficiency
The proposed rules would likely enhance economic efficiency by enabling investors more
easily to identify funds that align with their preferences over private fund terms, investment
strategies, and investment outcomes, and also by causing fund advisers to align their actions
more closely with the interests of investors through the elimination of prohibited practices.
First, the proposed rules could increase the usefulness of the information that investors
receive from private fund advisers regarding the fees, expenses, and performance of the fund,
and regarding the preferential treatment of certain investors of the fund through the more detailed
and standardized disclosures discussed above.
381 These enhanced disclosures would provide
more information to investors regarding the ability and potential fit of investment advisers,
which may improve the quality of the matches that investors make with private funds and
investment advisers in terms of fit with investor preferences over private fund terms, investment
strategies, and investment outcomes. The enhanced disclosures may also reduce search costs, as
investors may be better able to evaluate the funds of an investment adviser based on the
information to be disclosed at the time of the investment and in the quarterly statement.
Regarding preferential treatment, the proposed rules further align fund adviser actions
and investor interests by prohibiting certain preferential treatment practices altogether (instead of
only requiring disclosure), specifically prohibiting preferential terms regarding liquidity or
transparency that have a material, negative impact on investors in the fund or a substantially
similar pool of assets.
382 Prohibiting these activities, and prohibiting remaining preferential

381 See supra section V.C.2, V.C.3.
382 See supra section II.E.
262
treatment activities unless disclosure is provided, may eliminate some of the complexity and
uncertainty that investors face about the outcomes of their investment choices, further reducing
costs investors must undertake to find appropriate matches between their choice of private fund
and their preferences over private fund terms, investment strategies, and investment outcomes.
In addition, the proposed rules’ requirements for advisers to obtain audits of fund
financial statements would enhance investor protection and thereby improve the efficiency of the
investment adviser search process. While many proposed disclosure requirements involve
disclosures only to current investors, and not prospective investors, the proposed rule’s
disclosure requirements may enhance efficiency through the tendency of some fund advisers to
rely on investors in current funds to be prospective investors in their future funds. For example,
when fund advisers raise multiple funds sequentially, current investors can base their decisions
on whether to invest in subsequent funds based on the disclosures of the prior funds.383 As such,
improved disclosures can improve the efficiency of investments without directly requiring
disclosures to all prospective investors. Investors may therefore face a lower overall cost of
searching for, and choosing among, alternative private fund investments.
Lastly, the proposed rules prohibit various activities that represent possible conflicting
arrangements between investors and fund advisers. To the extent that investors currently bear
costs of searching for fund advisers who do not engage in these arrangements, or bear costs
associated with monitoring fund adviser conduct to avoid harm, then prohibiting these activities
may lower investors’ overall costs of searching for, monitoring, and choosing among alternative
private fund investments. This may particularly be the case for smaller investors who are
currently more frequently harmed by the activities being considered.

383 See supra section V.B.3.
263
There may be losses of efficiency from the proposed rules to prohibit various activities,
and from any changes in fund practices in response to the proposed rules, to the extent that
investors currently benefit from those activities or incur costs from those changes. For example,
investors who currently receive preferential terms that would be prohibited under the proposal
may have only invested with their current adviser because they were able to secure preferential
terms. With those preferential terms removed, those investors may choose to re-evaluate the
match between their choice of adviser and their overall preferences over private fund terms,
investment strategy, and investment outcomes. Depending on the results of this re-evaluation,
those investors may choose to incur costs of searching for new fund advisers or alternative
investments.
2. Competition
The proposed rules may also affect competition in the market for private fund investing.
As discussed above, private fund adviser fees may currently total in the hundreds of billions of
dollars per year.
384 Enhanced competition from additional transparency may lead to lower fees
or may direct investor assets to different funds, fund advisers, or other investments.
First, to the extent that the enhanced transparency of certain fees, expenses, and
performance of private funds under the proposal may reduce the cost to some investors of
comparing private fund investments, then current investors evaluating whether to continue
investing in subsequent funds may be more likely to reject future funds raised by their current
adviser in favor of the terms of competing funds, including new funds that advisers may offer as
alternatives that they would not have offered absent the increased transparency.

384 Id.
264
To the extent that this heightened transparency encourages advisers to make more
substantial disclosures to prospective investors, investors may also be able to obtain more
detailed fee and expense and performance data for other prospective fund investments,
strengthening the effect of the proposal on competition.385 Advisers may therefore update the
terms that they offer to investors, or investors may shift their assets to different funds.
Second, because enhanced transparency of preferential treatment will be provided to both
current and prospective investors, there may be reduced search costs to all investors seeking to
compare funds on the basis of which investors receive preferential treatment. For example, some
funds may lose investors who only participated in the fund because of the preferential terms they
received. We anticipate that investors withdrawing from a fund because of a loss of preferential
treatment would redeploy their capital elsewhere, and so new advisers would have a new pool of
investment capital to pursue.
3. Capital Formation
We believe the proposed rules would facilitate capital formation by causing advisers to
more efficiently manage private fund clients, by prohibiting activities that may currently deter
investors from private fund investing because they represent possible conflicting arrangements,
and by enabling investors to choose more efficiently among funds and fund advisers. This may
reduce the cost of intermediation between investors and portfolio investments. To the extent this
occurs, this would lead to enhanced capital formation in the real economy, as portfolio
companies would have greater access to the supply of financing from private fund investors.

385 See supra section V.C.2.
265
This would contribute to greater capital formation through greater investment into those portfolio
companies.
The proposed rules may also enhance capital formation through their competitive effects
by inducing new fund advisers to enter private fund markets.
386 To the extent that existing fund
advisers reduce their fees in order to compete more effectively, or to the extent that existing
pools of capital are redirected to fund advisers who generate enhanced returns for their investors
(for example, advisers who generate larger returns, less correlated returns across different
investment strategies, or returns with more favorable risk profiles), the competitive effects of the
proposal may provide new opportunities for capital allocation and potentially spur new
investments.
Similarly, and in addition to lower costs of intermediation between investors and
portfolio investments, the proposed rules may directly lower the costs charged by fund advisers
to investors by improving transparency over fees and expenses. The proposed rules may also
enhance overall investor returns (for example, as above, larger returns, less correlated returns
across different investment strategies, or returns with more favorable risk profiles) by improving
transparency over performance information, prohibiting conflicting arrangements, and requiring
external financial statement audits and fairness opinions. To the extent these increased investor
funds from lower expenses and enhanced returns are redeployed to new investments, there would
be further benefits to capital formation.
There may be reduced capital formation associated with the proposed rules to prohibit
various activities, to the extent that investors currently benefit from those activities. For
example, investors who currently receive preferential terms that would be prohibited under the

386 See supra section V.D.2.
266
proposal may withdraw their capital from their existing fund advisers. Those investors may have
less total capital to deploy after bearing costs of searching for new investment opportunities, or
they may redeploy their capital away from private funds more broadly and into investments with
less effective capital formation.
E. Alternatives Considered
1. Alternatives to the Requirement for Private Fund Advisers to
Obtain an Annual Audit
First, the Commission could consider broadening the application of this rule to, for
example, apply to all advisers to private funds, rather than to only advisers to private funds that
are registered or required to be registered. Extending the application of the proposed audit rule
to all advisers and in the context of these pooled investment vehicles would increase the benefits
of helping investors receive more reliable information from private fund advisers associated with
the rule. Investors would, as a result, have greater assurance in both the valuation of fund assets
and, because these valuations often serve as the basis for the calculation of the adviser’s fees, the
fees charged by advisers. However, the extension of the proposed rule to apply to all advisers
would likely impose the costs of obtaining audits on smaller funds advised by unregistered
advisers. For these types of funds, the cost of obtaining such an audit may be large compared to
the value of fund assets and fees and the related value to investors of the required audit, and so
this alternative could inhibit entry of new funds, potentially constraining the growth of the
private fund market.
Second, instead of broadening the proposed audit rule, we could consider narrowing the
rule by providing full or partial exemptions. For example, we could exempt smaller funds or we
could exempt an adviser from compliance with the rule where an adviser plays no role in valuing
the fund’s assets, receives little or no compensation for its services, or receives no compensation
267
based on the value of the fund’s assets. We could also exempt advisers of hedge funds and other
funds determined to be liquid funds. Further, we could provide an exemption for private funds
below a certain asset threshold, for funds that have only related person investors, or for funds
that are below a minimum asset value or have a limited number of investors.
These exemptions could also be applied in tandem, for example by exempting only
advisers to hedge funds and other funds determined to be liquid funds below a certain asset
threshold. For each of these categories, we could consider partial instead of full exemptions, for
example by requiring an audit only every two (or more) years instead of not requiring any annual
audits at all. Further, the benefits of the rule may not be substantial for funds below a minimum
asset value, where the cost of obtaining such an audit would be relatively large compared to the
value of fund assets and fees that the rule is intended to provide a check on.
We believe, however, that this narrower alternative with the above exemptions to the
proposed audit rule would likely not provide the same investor protection benefits. Many of the
investor protection benefits discussed above are specifically associated with the general
applicability of the proposed audit rule.387
Finally, instead of requiring an audit as described in the proposed audit rule, we could
consider requiring that advisers provide other means of checking the adviser’s valuation of
private fund assets. For example, we could consider requiring that an adviser subject to the
proposed audit rule provide information to substantiate the adviser’s evaluation to its LPAC or, if
the fund has no LPAC, then to all, or only significant investors in the fund. We believe that such
methods for checking an adviser’s methods of valuation would be substantially less expensive to
obtain, which could reduce the cost burdens associated with an audit.

387 See supra section V.C.4.
268
However, we believe that these alternatives would likely not accomplish the same
investor protection benefits as the proposal to require an audit. As an immediate matter, limiting
the requirement like so would undermine the broader goal of the proposal to standardize
information made available to different investors. We believe, more generally, that these checks
would not provide the same level of assurance over valuation and, by extension, fees, to fund
investors as an audit. As discussed above, we have historically relied on financial statement
audits to verify the existence of pooled investment vehicle investments.
2. Alternatives to the Requirement to Distribute a Quarterly
Statement to Investors Disclosing Certain Information Regarding
Costs and Performance
The Commission could also consider requiring that additional and more granular
information be provided in the quarterly statements that we are proposing be sent by registered
investment advisers to investors in private funds. For example, we could require that these
statements include investor-level capital account information, which would provide each investor
with means of monitoring capital account levels at regular intervals throughout the year.
Because this more specific information would show exactly how fees, expenses, and
performance have affected the investor, it could, effectively, further reduce the cost to an
investor of monitoring the value of the services the adviser provides to the investor. We believe,
however, that requiring capital account information for each investor would substantially
increase costs for funds associated with the preparation of these quarterly statements.
We could also, for example, require disclosure of performance information for each
portfolio investment. For funds determined to be illiquid funds in particular, we could require
advisers to report the IRR for portfolio investments, assuming no leverage, as well as the cash
269
flows for each portfolio investment.388 Given the cash flows, end investors could compute other
performance metrics, such as PME, for themselves. In addition, this information would give
investors means of checking the more general performance information provided in a quarterly
statement, and would, further, allow investors to track and evaluate the portfolio investments
chosen by an adviser over time. Cash flow disclosures for each portfolio investment would
enable an investor to construct measures of performance that address the MOIC’s inability to
capture the timing of cash flows, avoid the IRR’s assumptions on reinvestment rates of early
cash flow distributions, and avoid the IRR’s sensitivity to cash flows early in the life of the
pool.
389 Investors would also be able to compare performance of individual portfolio
investments against the compensation and ownership percentage and other data that advisers
would be required to disclose for each portfolio investment under the proposal.390
While we believe that advisers would have cash flow data for each portfolio investment
available in connection with the preparation of the standardized fund performance information
required to be reported pursuant to the proposed rule, calculating performance information for
each portfolio investment in accordance with the rule could add significant operational burdens
and costs, which would vary depending on factors that include the number of portfolio

388 For funds determined to be liquid funds, disclosure of performance information for each portfolio investment
may be of comparatively lower incremental benefit to investors, because such funds typically have a much
larger number of investments. To the extent that investors’ preferences over different liquid funds depend on
more fund outcomes than their total return on their aggregate capital contributions, for example a preference for
fund advisers with uncorrelated returns across different portfolio investments, then this alternative could
provide similar additional benefits.
389 See supra section V.B.3. See, e.g., Robert Harris, Tim Jenkinson and Steven Kaplan, Private Equity
Performance: What Do We Know?, 69 (5) Journal of Finance 1851 (Mar. 27, 2014), available at
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12154; Steven Kaplan and Antoinette Schoar, Private
Equity Performance: Returns, Persistence, and Capital Flows, 60 (5) Journal of Finance (Aug. 2005), available
at http://web.mit.edu/aschoar/www/KaplanSchoar2005.pdf.
390 See supra section II.A.1.b.
270
investments held by a private fund. The operational burden and cost would also depend on
whether the alternative proposal required both gross and net performance information for each
portfolio investment, which would determine whether the information reflected the impact of
fund-level fees and expenses on the performance of each portfolio investment. Requiring both
gross and net performance information for each portfolio investment would be of greater use to
investors, but would come at a higher operational burden and cost, as providing net performance
information would require more complex calculations to allocate fund fees and expenses across
portfolio investments. Lastly, to the extent that advisers were required to disclose cash flows for
each portfolio investment without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities, this calculation
may be more burdensome than the single calculation required to make the required fund-level
performance information disclosures without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities.
As a final granular addition to performance disclosures, the Commission could require
the reporting of a wider variety of performance metrics for hedge funds and other funds
determined to be liquid funds, similar to the detailed disclosure requirements for funds
determined to be illiquid funds. These could include requirements for funds determined to be
liquid funds to report estimates of fund-level alphas, betas, Sharpe ratios, or other performance
metrics. We believe that for investors of funds determined to be liquid funds, absolute returns
are of highest priority, and furthermore investors may calculate many of these additional
performance metrics themselves by combining fund annual total returns with publicly available
data. Therefore, we believe these additional reporting requirements would impose additional
costs with comparatively little benefit.
Further, the Commission could also consider requiring less information be provided to
investors in these quarterly statements. For example, instead of requiring the disclosure of
271
comprehensive fee and expense information, we could require that advisers disclose only a
subset of these, including investments fees and expenses paid by a portfolio company to the
adviser. These fees in particular may currently present the biggest burden on investors to track,
and requiring the disclosure of only these fees could reduce some costs associated with the effort
of compiling, on a quarterly basis, information regarding management fees more generally. We
believe, however, that if we did not require comprehensive information, investors would not
derive the same utility in monitoring fund performance.
We could also consider requiring that comprehensive information regarding fees and
performance be reported on Form ADV, instead of being disclosed to investors individually.
Reporting publicly on Form ADV would continue to allow investors to monitor performance,
while also allowing public review of important information about an adviser. However, because
the information we propose to require under the rule is tailored to what we believe would serve
existing investors in a fund, we believe that direct delivery to investors would better reduce
monitoring costs for investors. Further, as discussed above, prospective investors have separate
protections, including against misleading, deceptive, and confusing information in
advertisements as set forth in the recently adopted marketing rule.
391
Instead of requiring disclosure of comprehensive fee and expense information to
investors, we could consider prohibiting certain fee and expense practices. For example, we
could prohibit charging fees at the fund level in excess of a certain maximum amount that we
could determine to be what investors could reasonably anticipate being charged by an adviser.
This could, effectively, protect investors from unanticipated charges, and reduce monitoring
costs to investors. Further, we could prohibit certain compensation arrangements, such as the “2

391 See supra section II.A.2.
272
and 20” model or compensation from portfolio investments, to the extent the adviser also
receives management fees from the fund. Prohibition of the “2 and 20” model would cause
investors to reallocate their capital way from funds that employ this model and toward other
types of funds. It may cause advisers to consider and adopt more efficient models for private
fund investing in which the adviser gets a smaller fee and the investor gets a larger share of the
gross fund returns, and in which investors are generally better off.392 We could also consider
restricting management fee practices, for example by imposing limitations on sizes of
management fees, or requirement management fees to be based on invested capital or net asset
value rather than on committed capital. However, the benefits of prohibiting certain fee and
expense practices outright would need to be balanced against the costs associated with limiting
an adviser and investor’s flexibility in designing fee and expense arrangements tailored to their
preferences. We believe that any such prohibitions would, accordingly, need to be carefully
tailored.
Similarly, instead of requiring disclosure of comprehensive performance information to
investors, we could consider prohibiting certain performance disclosure practices. For example,
instead of requiring disclosure of performance without the effect of fund-level subscription
facilities, we could consider prohibiting advisers from presenting performance with the effect of
such facilities. Similarly, we could consider prohibiting advisers from presenting combined
performance information for multiple funds, such as a main fund and a co-investment fund that
pays lower or no fees. We believe that the required disclosures present the correct standardized,

392 For example, the compensation model for hedge funds can provide fund advisers with embedded leverage,
encouraging greater risk-taking. See, e.g., Alon Brav, Wei Jiang, and Rongchen Li, Governance by Persuasion:
Hedge Fund Activism and Market-Based Shareholder Influence, European Corporate Governance Institute –
Finance (Working Paper No. 797/2021), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=3955116 or
http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3955116.
273
detailed information for investors to be able to evaluate performance, but we do not believe there
are harms from advisers electing to disclose additional information. As such, we think the
benefits of prohibiting any performance disclosure practices would likely be negligible, while
there could be substantial costs to investors who value the information that would be prohibited
under this alternative.
Finally, the Commission could consider broadening the application of this rule to, for
example, apply to all advisers to private funds, rather than to only advisers to private funds that
are registered or required to be registered. Extending the application of the proposed rule to all
advisers would increase the benefits of helping investors receive more detailed and standardized
information regarding fees, expenses, and performance. Investors would, as a result, have better
information with which to evaluate the services of these advisers. It is, however, not clear to us
that these benefits would also be realized in contexts where fund performance is not as heavily
relied upon when obtaining new investors, as is the case for private funds. Further, the extension
of the proposed rule to apply to all advisers would likely impose the costs of compiling,
preparing, and distributing quarterly statements on smaller funds advised by unregistered
advisers. For these types of funds, these quarterly statement costs may be large compared to the
value of fund assets and fees and the related value to investors of the required audit.
3. Alternative to the Required Manner of Preparing and Distributing
Quarterly Statements and Audited Financial Statements
The proposed rules would require private fund advisers to “distribute” quarterly
statements and audited annual financial statements to investors in the private fund, and this
requirement could be satisfied through either paper or electronic means.393 The Commission

393 See supra footnote 99.
274
could consider requiring private fund advisers to prepare and distribute the required disclosures
electronically using a structured data language, such as the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting
Language (“Inline XBRL”).
An Inline XBRL requirement for the disclosures could benefit private fund investors with
access to XBRL analysis software by enabling them to more efficiently access, compile, and
analyze the disclosures in quarterly statements and audited annual financial statements,
facilitating calculations and comparisons of the disclosed information across different time
periods or across different portfolio investments within the same time period. For any such
private fund investors who receive disclosures from multiple private funds, an Inline XBRL
requirement could also facilitate comparisons of the disclosed information across those funds.
An Inline XBRL requirement for the proposed disclosures would diverge from the
Commission’s other Inline XBRL requirements, which apply to disclosures that are made
available to the public and the Commission, thus allowing for the realization of informational
benefits (such as increased market efficiency and decreased information asymmetry) through the
processing of Inline XBRL disclosures by information intermediaries such as analysts and
researchers.394 Under the current proposal, the required disclosures would not be provided to the
public or the Commission for processing and analysis. Thus, the magnitude of benefit resulting
from an Inline XBRL alternative for the disclosure requirements in this proposal may be lower
than for other rules with Inline XBRL requirements.395

394 See, e.g., Y. Cong, J. Hao, and L. Zou, The Impact of XBRL Reporting on Market Efficiency, 28 J. INFO. SYS.
181 (2014) (finding support for the hypothesis that “XBRL reporting facilitates the generation and infusion of
idiosyncratic information into the market and thus improves market efficiency”); Y. Huang, J.T. Parwada, Y.G.
Shan, and J. Yang, Insider Profitability and Public Information: Evidence From the XBRL Mandate (Working
Paper, 2019) (finding XBRL adoption levels the informational playing field between insiders and non-insiders).
395 See, e.g., Updated Disclosure Requirements and Summary Prospectus for Variable Annuity and Variable Life
Insurance Contracts, Release No. IC-33814 (Mar. 11, 2020) [85 FR 25964 at 26041 (Jun. 10, 2020)] (Noting
275
Compared to the proposal, an Inline XBRL requirement would result in additional
compliance costs for private funds and advisers, as a result of the requirement to select, apply,
and review the appropriate XBRL U.S. GAAP taxonomy element tags for the required
disclosures (or pay a third-party service provider to do so on their behalf). In addition, private
fund advisers may not have prior experience with preparing Inline XBRL documents, as neither
Form PF nor Form ADV is filed using Inline XBRL. Thus, under this alternative, private funds
may incur the initial Inline XBRL implementation costs that are often associated with being
subject to an Inline XBRL requirement for the first time (including, as applicable, the cost of
training in-house staff to prepare filings in Inline XBRL and the cost to license Inline XBRL
filing preparation software from vendors). Accordingly, the magnitude of compliance cost
resulting from an Inline XBRL requirement under this proposal may be higher than for other
rules with Inline XBRL requirements.
4. Alternatives to the Prohibitions from Engaging in Certain
Sales Practices, Conflicts of Interest, and Compensation Schemes
The Commission could also consider prohibiting other activities, in addition to those
currently prohibited in the proposed rule. For example, we could prohibit advisers from charging
private funds for expenses generally understood to be adviser expenses, such as those incurred in
connection with the maintenance and operation of the adviser’s business. To the extent that the
performance of these activities is outsourced to a consultant, for example, and the fund is
charged for that service, advisers may be effectively shifting expenses that would be generally
recognized as adviser expenses to instead be fund expenses. The prohibition of such charges

that an Inline XBRL requirement for certain variable contract prospectus disclosures, which are publicly
available, would include informational benefits stemming from use of the Inline XBRL data by parties other
than investors, including financial analysts, data aggregators, and Commission staff. While the required
disclosures in this proposal would not be provided to the public or the Commission, such benefits would not
accrue from an Inline XBRL requirement for the required disclosures).
276
could reduce investor monitoring costs. We believe, however, that identifying the types of
charges associated with activities that should never be charged to the fund would likely be
difficult. As a result, any such prohibition could risk effectively limiting an adviser’s ability to
outsource certain activities that could be better performed by a consultant, because under the
prohibition the adviser would not be able to pass those costs on to the fund.
Further, the Commission could consider providing an exemption for funds utilizing a
pass-through expense model from the prohibition on charging fees or expenses associated with
certain examinations, investigations, and regulatory and compliance fees and expenses. This
would allow advisers to avoid the costs associated with re-structuring any arrangements not
compliant with the prohibition, given the proposed rules would likely prohibit certain aspects of
these expense models.396 We believe, however, that any exemption would need to be carefully
balanced against the risk that it would continue to subject the fund to an adviser’s incentive to
shift its fees and expenses to the fund to reduce its overhead and operating costs.
We could also consider requiring detailed and standardized disclosures of the activities
under consideration, instead of prohibiting the activities outright. This alternative may be
desirable to the extent that certain investors would be willing to bear the costs of these activities
in exchange for certain other beneficial terms, and would be willing to give informed consent to
fund advisers engaging in the practices under consideration. However, we do not believe that
disclosure requirements would achieve the same benefit of protecting investors from harm,
because many of the practices are deceptive and result in obscured payments, and so may be
used to defraud investors even if detailed disclosures are made. Moreover, as discussed above,

396 See supra section V.C.3.
277
private funds typically lack fully independent governance mechanisms more common to other
markets that could help protect investors from harm in the context of the activities considered.397
We could, therefore, consider exceptions that allow certain prohibited activities if
disclosed and if appropriate governance or other protections are in place. For example, we could
consider requiring a fund’s LPAC (or other similar body) or directors to give approval to any of
the activities under consideration before the adviser may pursue them. Similarly, we could
require advisers to obtain approval for any of the activities under consideration by a majority
(either by number or by interest) of investors. However, we believe that allowing such activities,
even under such governance, would not achieve all of the same benefits of protecting investors,
by the same logic that many of the practices are deceptive and result in obscured payments, and
so may be used to defraud investors even if disclosed and governed.
5. Alternatives to the Requirement that an Adviser to Obtain a
Fairness Opinion in Connection with Certain Adviser-Led Secondary
Transactions
The Commission could consider requiring advisers to obtain a third party valuation in
connection with certain adviser-led secondary transactions, instead of a fairness opinion. We
believe that these third party valuations would likely involve more diligence of the proposed
transaction than the reviews conducted in connection with obtaining a fairness opinion, and
therefore, requiring these valuations could provide even greater assurances to investors that the
terms of the transaction are fair to their interests. However, we believe that obtaining a thirdparty valuation would likely be significantly more costly to obtain. If these costs could be
passed on to participants in these transactions, it could make them less attractive to investors as a
means to obtain liquidity.

397 See supra section V.B.1.
278
We could also consider changing the scope of this rule. For example, we could consider
broadening the application of this rule to, for example, apply to all advisers, including advisers
that are not required to register as investment advisers with the Commission, such as stateregistered advisers and exempt reporting advisers. Investors would, as a result, receive the
assurance of the fairness of more adviser-led secondary transactions. The extension of the
proposed rule to apply to all advisers would, however, likely impose the costs of obtaining
fairness opinions on smaller funds advised by unregistered advisers, and for these types of funds,
the cost of obtaining such opinions would likely be relatively large compared to the value of fund
assets and fees that the rule is intended to provide a check on, which could discourage them from
undertaking these transactions. This could ultimately reduce liquidity opportunities for fund
investors. Alternatively, we could provide exemptions from the rule. For example, an
exemption could be provided where the adviser undertakes a competitive sale process for the
assets being sold or for certain advisers to hedge funds or other funds determined to be liquid
funds for whom the concerns regarding pricing of illiquid assets may be less relevant. These
exemptions would reduce the costs on advisers associated with obtaining the fairness opinion,
which could ultimately reduce costs for investors. However, we believe that any such
exemptions could reduce the benefits of the proposed rule associated with providing greater
assurance to investors of the fairness of the transaction. We believe that, even under
circumstances where the adviser has conducted a competitive sales process, the effective check
on this process provided by the fairness opinion would benefit investors. Further, even for
advisers to hedge funds or other funds determined to be liquid funds who are advising funds with
predominantly highly liquid securities, we believe that a fairness opinion would be beneficial to
279
investors because the conflicts of interest inherent in structuring and leading a transaction may,
despite the nature of the assets in the fund, harm investors.
398
6. Alternatives to the Prohibition from Providing Certain
Preferential Terms and Requirement to Disclose All Preferential
Treatment
Instead of requiring that private fund advisers provide investors and prospective investors
with written disclosures regarding all preferential treatment the adviser or its related persons
provided to other investors in the same fund, the Commission could consider prohibiting all such
terms. This could provide investors in private funds with increased confidence that the adviser’s
negotiations with other investors would not affect their investment in the private fund. We
preliminarily believe, however, that an outright prohibition of all preferential terms may not
provide significant additional benefits beyond prohibitions on providing certain preferential
terms regarding redemption or information about portfolio holdings or exposures. As discussed
above, we believe that certain types of preferential terms raise relatively few concerns, if
disclosed.399 Further, an outright prohibition of all preferential terms may limit the adviser’s
ability to respond to an individual investor’s concerns during the course of attracting capital
investments to private funds.
Further, we could consider prohibiting all preferential terms regarding redemption or
information about portfolio holdings or exposures, rather than just those that the adviser
reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect on other investors in that fund or in a
substantially similar pool of assets. This could increase the investor protections associated with
the rule, by eliminating the risk that a term not reasonably expected to have a material negative

398 Moreover, the costs to liquid fund advisers are more likely to be limited, as many secondary transactions by
liquid fund advisers are not adviser-led and so would not necessitate a fairness opinion.
399 See supra section II.E.
280
effect on investors could, ultimately, harm investors. We believe, however, that this alternative
would likely provide more limited benefits and would increase costs associated with the rule
similar to the above alternatives, for example by limiting the adviser’s ability to respond to an
individual investor’s concerns during the course of attracting capital investments to private
funds.
In addition, for preferential terms not regarding redemption or information about
portfolio holdings or exposures, we could consider requiring advisers to private funds to provide
disclosure only when the term has a material negative effect on other fund investors. This could
reduce the compliance burden on advisers associated with the costs of disclosure. We believe,
however, that limiting disclosure to only those terms that an adviser determines to have a
material negative effect could reduce an investor’s ability to recognize the potential for harm
from unforeseen favoritism toward other investors, relative to a requirement to disclose all
preferential treatment.
F. Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the economic analysis of the proposed
rule. To the extent possible, the Commission requests that commenters provide supporting data
and analysis with respect to the benefits, costs, and effects on competition, efficiency, and capital
formation of adopting the proposed amendments or any reasonable alternatives. In particular,
the Commission asks commenters to consider the following questions:
o What additional qualitative or quantitative information should the Commission consider
as part of the baseline for its economic analysis of these amendments?
o Has the Commission accurately characterized the costs and benefits of proposed rule? If
not, why not? Should any of the costs or benefits be modified? What, if any, other costs
or benefits should the Commission take into account? If possible, please offer ways of
281
estimating these costs and benefits. What additional considerations can the Commission
use to estimate the costs and benefits of the proposed amendments?
o Has the Commission accurately characterized the effects on competition, efficiency, and
capital formation arising from the proposed rules? If not, why not?
o Has the Commission accurately characterized the economic effects of the above
alternatives? If not, why not? Should any of the costs or benefits be modified? What, if
any, other costs or benefits should the Commission take into account? Are there other
reasonable alternatives to the proposed amendments? What are the economic effects of
any other alternatives?
o Are there data sources or data sets that can help the Commission refine its estimates of
the costs and benefits associated with the proposed amendments? If so, please identify
them.
o How would the proposed delivery of the quarterly statement affect the reporting practices
of advisers, including the costs and benefits of these statements? Would advisers add the
required report to the report that they currently provide to investors? Would advisers
substitute the required report for an existing report? Explain.
o What are the benefits to investors of obtaining the information that would be required
under the proposal in a standardized format that would enable them to make comparisons
across alternative fund investments? Explain. Would the benefits to investors vary based
on the investor’s scale of operations, relationship with the adviser, or other factors?
282
Explain. Please provide data, if available, to support your answer along with details
regarding data sources and interpretation of statistics, where appropriate.
o Would the proposed rules strengthen the bargaining power of investors in negotiating
with private fund advisers? If so, under what circumstances, and for what types of funds
and investors would this effect occur? How would it affect other investors who do not
gain bargaining power as a result of the proposed rules? Please explain your answer and
provide supporting data, if possible.
o What would the aggregate total cost (including but not limited to the audit fee) be of
complying with the new audit requirement, separately, for (a) funds that currently receive
audits and (b) funds that would newly receive an audit under the proposed rule? For
each, what is the current per-fund cost of an audit? Is the per-fund cost different between
the funds that currently receive audits and would newly receive audits? If yes, explain
Please include an explanation of any differences between the funds that currently receive
an audit and the funds that would newly receive an audit that would explain the
differences in their per-fund audit costs. Provide quantitative evidence to support your
explanation, if available.
o Would the proposed rules introduce new fixed costs of compliance? Would they cause
private funds or fund advisers to consolidate their operations to economize on those
costs? Please explain. Provide quantitative evidence to support your explanation, if
available.
o To what extent do funds currently provide quarterly statements to investors, and what is
the cost of providing these statements? How are they delivered? How do investors use
them? What are the contents of these statements currently? How do the current contents
283
compare with the contents that would be required under the proposed rule? Explain.
o We believe that the information in the new quarterly statements would supplement the
information that investors currently receive about their fund investments and that advisers
would not respond to the proposal by discontinuing any reports to investors. Is this
correct? Why or why not? Please explain.
o What fee and expense information is currently available to investors for use in comparing
investment opportunities among similar funds (sponsored by the same adviser or different
advisers)? How does this information differ from the information that advisers would be
required to provide under the proposed rule? In what way does the lack of this
information affect investor choice or the ability of investors to monitor fund performance
net of fees and expenses?
o What performance information is currently available for investors for use in comparing
investment opportunities among similar funds (sponsored by the same adviser or different
advisers)? How does this information differ from the information that advisers would be
required to provide under the proposed rule?
o How frequently do advisers currently engage in each of the activities that would be
prohibited under the proposed rule? Does this frequency vary depending on the type of
adviser or investor? For each practice, what is the current business purpose of the
activity and how else might that purpose be achieved (if the activity were prohibited)?
Please provide quantitative evidence on the magnitude of the activity, e.g., how much
money do advisers and related persons receive from the fee and expense arrangements
that would be prohibited?
o What is the economic effect on investors, currently, of the activities we propose to
284
prohibit under the proposed rule? What empirical evidence is there that those activities
make investors worse off?
o What data exists regarding the costs to investors of conflicts of interest in connection
with adviser-led secondary transactions where an adviser offers fund investors the option
to sell their interests in the private fund, or to exchange them for new interests in another
vehicle advised by the adviser? How do costs vary according to the presence or absence
of the disclosure that would be required under the proposed rule?
o From what sources do investors receive information about fund performance: (a) when
comparing alternative prospective fund investments and (b) for evaluating the
performance of an ongoing und investment? For example, do investors obtain this
information directly from the advisers or from a third party? If from a third party, from
what source does the third party obtain the fund performance information, and what is the
cost of this information? How does the source vary with the fund type or third party, if at
all?
o How frequently and under what conditions are private fund investors (current and
prospective) unable to obtain information from fund advisers or third parties on the fund
performance?
o Do investors rely on IRR and MOIC for evaluating the performance of funds determined
to be illiquid funds? What additional information do investors use to evaluate illiquid
fund performance? How frequently do they rely on this information? From what sources
do they currently obtain this information?
o How do investors who do not have access to this information evaluate illiquid fund
performance? What alternative sources of information do they rely upon?
285
o Do investors rely on annual total returns for evaluating the performance of funds
determined to be liquid funds? When evaluating performance partway through a current
year, do investors rely on cumulative total return for the current calendar year? What
additional information do investors use to evaluate liquid fund performance? How
frequently do they rely on this information? From what sources do they currently obtain
this information?
o How do investors who do not have access to this information evaluate liquid fund
performance? What alternative sources of information do they rely upon?
286
VI. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A. Introduction
Certain provisions of our proposal would result in new “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).400 The
proposed amendments would also have an impact on the current collection of information
burdens of rules 206(4)-7 and 204-2 under the Advisers Act. The title of the new collection of
information requirements we are proposing are “Rule 211(h)(1)-2 under the Advisers Act,”
“Rule 206(4)-10 under the Advisers Act,” “Rule 211(h)(2)-2 under the Advisers Act,” and “Rule
211(h)(2)-3 under the Advisers Act.” The Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) has not
yet assigned control numbers for these new collections of information. The titles for the existing
collections of information that we are proposing to amend are: (i) “Rule 206(4)-7 under the
Advisers Act (17 CFR 275.206(4)-7)” (OMB control number 3235-0585) and (ii) “Rule 204-2
under the Advisers Act (17 CFR 275.204-2)” (OMB control number 3235-0278). The
Commission is submitting these collections of information to OMB for review and approval in
accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct or sponsor,
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a
currently valid OMB control number.
We discuss below the new collection of information burdens associated with new rules
211(h)(1)-2, 206(4)-10, 211(h)(2)-2, and 211(h)(2)-3 as well as the revised existing collection of
information burdens associated with the proposed amendments to rules 206(4)-7 and 204-2.

400 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
287
Responses provided to the Commission in the context of amendments to rules 206(4)-7 and 204-
2 would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. Because the
information collected pursuant to new rules 211(h)(1)-2, 211(h)(2)-2, and 211(h)(2)-3 requires
disclosures to existing investors and in some cases potential investors, these disclosures would
not be kept confidential. Proposed new rule 206(4)-10 requires the collection of two types of
information: one type (the audited financial statements) would be distributed only to investors in
the private fund, and the other (notifications to the Commission) would be kept confidential
subject to the provisions of applicable law.
B. Quarterly Statements
Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2 would require an investment adviser registered or required to
be registered with the Commission to prepare a quarterly statement that includes certain
standardized disclosures regarding the cost of investing in the private fund and the private fund’s
performance for any private fund that it advises, directly or indirectly, that has at least two full
calendar quarters of operating results, and distribute the quarterly statement to the private fund's
investors within 45 days after each calendar quarter end, unless such a quarterly statement is
prepared and distributed by another person.
401 The quarterly statement would provide investors
with fee and expense disclosure for the prior quarterly period or, in the case of a newly formed
private fund initial account statement, its first two full calendar quarters of operating results. It
would also provide investors with certain performance information depending on whether the
fund is categorized as a liquid fund or an illiquid fund.402

401 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2.
402 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2(d).
288
The collection of information is necessary to provide private fund investors with
information about their private fund investments. The quarterly statement would allow a private
fund investor to compare standardized cost and performance information across its private fund
investments. We believe this information would help inform investment decisions, including
whether to remain invested in certain private funds or to invest in other private funds managed
by the adviser or its related persons. More broadly, this disclosure would help inform investors
about the cost and performance dynamics of this marketplace and potentially improve efficiency
for future investments.
Each requirement to disclose information, offer to provide information, or adopt policies
and procedures constitutes a “collection of information” requirement under the PRA. This
collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.211(h)(1)-2 and is mandatory. The respondents
to these collections of information requirements would be investment advisers that are registered
or required to be registered with the Commission that advise one or more private funds.
Based on Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) data, as of November 30,
2021, there were 14,832 investment advisers registered with the Commission. According to this
data, 5,037 registered advisers provide advice to private funds.403 We estimate that these
advisers would, on average, each provide advice to 9 private funds.404 We further estimate that
these private funds would, on average, each have a total of 67 investors.405 As a result, an
average private fund adviser would have, on average, a total of 603 investors across all private
funds it advises. As noted above, because the information collected pursuant to proposed rule

403 See Form ADV, Part 1A, Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).
404 See Form ADV, Part 1A, Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).
405 See Form ADV, Part 1A, Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).A., #13.
289
211(h)(1)-2 requires disclosures to private fund investors, these disclosures would not be kept
confidential.
We have made certain estimates of this data solely for the purpose of this PRA analysis.

Notes:
1. The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates are based on salary information for the securities industry compiled by the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association’s Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2013. The estimated figures are modified by firm size,
employee benefits, overhead, and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation. See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,
Report on Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (“SIFMA Report”).
2. This includes the internal initial burden estimate annualized over a three-year period, plus 8 hours of ongoing annual burden hours and takes
into account that there would be four statements prepared each year. The estimate of 11 hours is based on the following calculation: ((9 initial
hours / 3 years) + 8 hours of additional ongoing burden hours) = 11 hours.
3. This estimated burden is based on the sum of the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 5 hours, ($2,480) for outside legal services and the
estimated wage rate of $310/hour, for 5 hours, ($1,550) for outside accountant assistance, and it assumes that there would be four statements
prepared each year. The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, takes into
account staff experience, a variety of sources including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
4. This includes the internal initial burden estimate annualized over a three-year period, plus 3 hours of ongoing annual burden hours that takes
into account that there would be four statements prepared each year. The estimate of 3.5 hours is based on the following calculation: ((1.5 initial
hours / 3 years) + 3 hours of additional ongoing burden hours) = 3.5 hours.
5. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $310/hour, for 3 hours, for outside accounting services, and it assumes that there
would be four statements distributed each year. See supra footnote 409 (regarding wage rates with respect to external cost estimates).
6. We estimate that 50% of advisers will use outside legal and accounting services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into
account that advisers may elect to use outside these services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as adviser budget and the
adviser’s standard practices for using such outside services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
C. Mandatory Private Fund Adviser Audits
Proposed rule 206(4)-10 would require investment advisers that are registered or required
to be registered to cause each private fund they advise, directly or indirectly, to undergo a
financial statement audit at least annually and upon liquidation that complies with the proposed
rule, unless the fund otherwise undergoes such an audit.406 We believe that proposed new rule
206(4)-10 would protect the fund and its investors against the misappropriation of fund assets
and that an audit performed by an independent public accountant would provide an important
check on the adviser’s valuation of private fund assets, which often serve as the basis for the
calculation of the adviser’s fees. The collection of information is necessary to provide private

406 See proposed rule 206(4)-10.
291
fund investors with information about their private fund investments and the Commission uses
this information in the context of its examination and oversight program.
Each requirement to disclose information, offer to provide information, or adopt policies
and procedures constitutes a “collection of information” requirement under the PRA. This
collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.206(4)-10 and is mandatory to the extent the
adviser provides investment advice to a private fund. The respondents to these collections of
information requirements would be investment advisers that are registered or required to be
registered with the Commission that advise one or more private funds. All responses required by
the proposed audit rule would be mandatory. One response type (the audited financial
statements) would be distributed only to investors in the private fund and would not be
confidential, and the other (notifications to the Commission) would be kept confidential subject
to the provisions of applicable law.
Based on IARD data, as of November 30, 2021, there were 14,832 investment advisers
registered with the Commission. According to this data, 5,037 registered advisers provide advice
to private funds.407 We estimate that these advisers would, on average, each provide advice to 9
private funds.
408 We further estimate that these private funds would, on average, each have a
total of 67 investors.409 As a result, an average private fund adviser would have, on average, a
total of 603 investors across all private funds it advises.

407 See Form ADV, Part 1A, Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).
408 See Form ADV, Part 1A, Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).
409 See Form ADV, Part 1A, Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).A., #13.

We have made certain estimates of this data, as discussed below, solely for the purpose of
this PRA analysis. The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden estimates

Notes:
1. See SIFMA Report supra Note 1 to Table 1 Rule 211(h)(1)-2 PRA Estimates.
2. The proposed audit provision would require an adviser to obtain an audit at least annually and upon an entity’s liquidation. To the extent not
prohibited, we anticipate that, in some cases, the fund will bear the audit expense, in other cases the adviser will bear it, and in other instances both the
293
adviser and fund will share the expense. The liquidation audit would serve as the annual audit for the fiscal year in which it occurs. See proposed rule
206(4)-10.
3. This estimate takes into account that the financial statements must be distributed once annually under the proposed audit rule and that a liquidation
audit would replace a final audit in a year. Based on our experience with similar requirements under the custody rule, we estimate the hour burden
imposed on the adviser relating to the distribution of the audited financial statements with respect to the investors in each fund should be minimal,
approximately one minute per investor. See Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No.
2968 (Dec. 30, 2009) [75 FR 1455 (Jan. 11, 2010)] (“Custody Rule 2009 Adopting Release”), at 59-60. We estimate that the average private fund has
67 investors.
4. Based on our experience, we estimate that the party (or parties) that bears the audit expense would pay an average audit fee of $60,000 per fund. We
estimate that individual fund audit fees would tend to vary over an estimated range from $15,000 to $300,000, and that some fund audit fees would be
higher or lower than this range. We understand that the price of the audit has many variables, such as whether it is a liquid fund or illiquid fund, the
number of its holdings, availability of a PCAOB-registered and –inspected auditor, economies of scale, and the location and size of the auditor.
5. The proposed rule would require the adviser or the private fund to enter into an agreement with the independent public accountant. The agreement
would require the independent public accountant that completes the audit to notify the Commission by electronic means directed to the Division of
Examinations promptly upon certain events. See proposed rule 206(4)-10(e).
6. For purposes of this PRA we assume that, regardless of whether the adviser or the fund enters into the written agreement, the accountant would incur
the hour burden of preparing the agreement. We also assume that, if the fund was party to the agreement, the fund would delegate the task of
reviewing the agreement to the adviser. This estimate also assumes that the adviser would enter into a separate agreement for each private fund, even if
multiple funds use the same auditor. We believe that written agreements are commonplace and reflect industry practice when a person retains the
services of a professional such as an accountant, and they are typically prepared by the accountant in advance. We therefore estimate that each adviser
would spend 1.25 hours to add the required provisions to, or confirm that the required provisions are in, the written agreement.
7. This includes the internal initial burden estimate annualized over a three-year period, plus 0.5 hours of ongoing annual burden hours, and it assumes
annual reassessment and execution: ((1.25 initial hours / 3 years) + 0.5 hours of additional ongoing burden hours) = 0.92 hours.
8. We assume the same frequency of these cost estimates as for the internal annual burden hours estimate.
D. Adviser-Led Secondaries
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2 would prohibit an adviser registered or required to be
registered from completing an adviser-led secondary transaction with respect to any private fund,
unless the adviser, prior to the closing of the transaction, distributes to investors in the private
fund a fairness opinion from an independent opinion provider and a summary of any material
business relationships the adviser or any of its related persons has, or has had within the past two
years, with the independent opinion provider.
410 We believe that this proposed requirement
would provide an important check against an adviser’s conflicts of interest in structuring and
leading a transaction from which it may stand to profit at the expense of private fund investors
and would help ensure that private fund investors are offered a fair price for their private fund
interests. Specifically, this requirement is designed to help ensure that investors receive the

410 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2.
294
benefit of an independent price assessment, which we believe will improve their decisionmaking ability and their overall confidence in the transaction. The collection of information is
necessary to provide investors with information about securities transactions in which they may
engage.
Each requirement to disclose information, offer to provide information, or adopt policies
and procedures constitutes a “collection of information” requirement under the PRA. This
collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.211(h)(2)-2 and is mandatory. The respondents
to these collections of information requirements would be investment advisers that are registered
or required to be registered with the Commission that advise one or more private funds. Based
on IARD data, as of November 30, 2021, there were 14,832 investment advisers registered with
the Commission. According to this data, 5,037 registered advisers provide advice to private
funds.411 Of these 5,037 advisers, we estimate that 10%, or approximately 504 advisers, conduct
an adviser-led secondary transaction each year. Of these advisers, we further estimate that each
conducts one adviser-led secondary transaction each year. As a result, an adviser would have
obligations under the proposed rule with regard to 67 investors.412 As noted above, because the
information collected pursuant to proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2 requires disclosures to private fund
investors, these disclosures would not be kept confidential.
We have made certain estimates of this data solely for the purpose of this PRA analysis.
The table below summarizes the annual burden estimates associated with the proposed rule’s
requirements.

Notes:

2. Includes the time an adviser would spend gathering materials to provide to the independent opinion provider so that the latter can prepare the
fairness opinion.
3. This estimated burden is based on our understanding of the general cost of a fairness opinion in the current market. The cost will vary based
on, among other things, the complexity, terms, and size of the adviser-led secondary transaction, as well as the nature of the assets of the fund.
4. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 1 hours, for outside legal services at the same frequency as the
internal burden hours estimate. The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services,
takes into account staff experience, a variety of sources including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
296
5. We estimate that 10% of all registered private fund advisers conduct in an adviser-led secondary transaction each year.
E. Disclosure of Preferential Treatment
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3 would prohibit all private fund advisers from providing
preferential terms to certain investors regarding redemption or information about portfolio
holdings or exposures.
413 The proposed rule would also prohibit these advisers from providing
any other preferential treatment to any investor in the private fund unless the adviser provides
written disclosures to prospective and current investors in a private fund regarding all
preferential treatment the adviser or its related persons are providing to other investors in the
same fund. For prospective investors, the proposed new rule would require advisers to provide
the written notice prior to the investor’s investment in the fund.414 For current investors, the
proposed new rule would require advisers to distribute an annual update regarding any
preferential treatment provided since the last notice, if any.415
The proposed new rule is designed to protect investors and serve the public interest by
requiring disclosure of preferential treatment afforded to certain investors. The proposed new
rule would increase transparency in order to better inform investors regarding the breadth of
preferential terms, the potential for those terms to affect their investment in the private fund, and
the potential costs (including compliance costs) associated with these preferential terms. Also,
this disclosure would help investors shape the terms of their relationship with the adviser of the
private fund. The collection of information is necessary to provide private fund investors with
information about their private fund investments.

413 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b).
414 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b)(1).
415 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b)(2).
297
Each requirement to disclose information, offer to provide information, or adopt policies
and procedures constitutes a “collection of information” requirement under the PRA. This
collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.211(h)(2)-3 and is mandatory. The respondents
to these collections of information requirements would be all investment advisers that advise one
or more private funds. Based on IARD data, as of November 30, 2021, there were 12,500
investment advisers that provide advice to private funds.416 We estimate that these advisers
would, on average, each provide advice to 7 private funds. We further estimate that these private
funds would, on average, each have a total of 63 investors. As a result, an average private fund
adviser would have a total of 441 investors across all private funds it advises. As noted above,
because the information collected pursuant to proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3 requires disclosures to
private fund investors and prospective investors, these disclosures would not be kept
confidential.
We have made certain estimates of this data solely for the purpose of this PRA analysis.
The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden estimates associated with the
proposed rule’s policies and procedures and annual review requirements.

416 The following types of private fund advisers, among others, would be subject to the proposed rule: unregistered
advisers (i.e., advisers that are not SEC registered but have a registration obligation, and those that may be
prohibited from registering with us), foreign private advisers, and advisers that rely on the intrastate exemption
from SEC registration and/or the de minimis exemption from SEC registration. However, we are unable to
estimate the number of advisers in each of these categories because these advisers do not file reports or other
information with the SEC and we are unable to find reliable, public information. As a result, the above estimate
is based on information from SEC-registered advisers to private funds, exempt reporting advisers (at the state
and Federal levels), and state-registered advisers to private funds. These figures are approximate.

Notes:

2. This includes the internal initial burden estimate annualized over a three-year period, plus 2 hours of ongoing annual burden hours and assumes
notices would be issued once annually to existing investors and once quarterly for prospective investors. The estimate of 3.3 hours is based on
the following calculation: ((4 initial hours /3 years) + 2 hours of additional ongoing burden hours) = 3.3 hours. The burden hours associated with
reviewing preferential treatment provided to other investors in the same fund and updating the written notice takes into account that (i) most
closed-end funds would only raise new capital for a finite period of time and thus the burden hours would likely decrease after the fundraising
period terminates for such funds since they would not continue to seek new investors and would not continue to agree to new preferential
treatment for new investors and (ii) most open-end private funds continuously raise capital and thus the burden hours would likely remain the
same year over year since they would continue to seek new investors and would continue to agree to preferential treatment for new investors.
3. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 1 hours, for outside legal services at the same frequency as the
internal burden hours estimate. The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services,
takes into account staff experience, a variety of sources including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
4. This includes the internal initial burden estimate annualized over a three-year period, plus 1.05 hours of ongoing annual burden hours. The
estimate of 1.13 hours is based on the following calculation: ((0.25 initial hours /3 years) + 1.05 hours of additional ongoing burden hours) = 1.13
hours.

5. We estimate that 75% of advisers will use outside legal services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into account that
advisers may elect to use outside legal services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as adviser budget and the adviser’s standard
practices for using outside legal services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
299
F. Written Documentation of Adviser’s Annual Review of Compliance Program
The proposed amendment to rule 206(4)-7 would require investment advisers that are
registered or required to be registered to document the annual review of their compliance policies
and procedures in writing.417 We believe that such a requirement would focus renewed attention
on the importance of the annual compliance review process and would help ensure that advisers
maintain records regarding their annual compliance review that will allow our staff to determine
whether an adviser has complied with the compliance rule.
This collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.206(4)-7 and is mandatory. The
Commission staff uses the collection of information in its examination and oversight program.
As noted above, responses provided to the Commission in the context of its examination and
oversight program concerning the proposed amendments to rule 206(4)-7 would be kept
confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law.
Based on IARD data, as of November 30, 2021, there were 14,832 investment advisers
registered with the Commission. In our most recent PRA submission for rule 206(4)-7, we
estimated a total hour burden of 1,152,663 hours, and the total annual external cost burden is $0.
The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden estimates associated
with the proposed amendments to rule 204-2.

Notes:
1. See SIFMA Report, supra Note 1 to Table 1 Rule 211(h)(1)-2 PRA Estimates.
2. We estimate that these proposed amendments would increase each registered investment adviser’s average annual collection burden under rule
206(4)-7 by 3 hours.

3. This estimated burden is based on the sum of the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 0.5 hours, ($248) for outside legal services and the
estimated wage rate of $310/hour, for 0.5 hours, ($155) for outside accountant assistance.

4. We estimate that 50% of advisers will use outside legal services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into account that
advisers may elect to use outside legal services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as adviser budget and the adviser’s standard
practices for using outside legal services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
G. Recordkeeping
The proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would require advisers to private funds to retain
books and records related to the proposed quarterly statement rule, the proposed audit rule, the
proposed adviser-led secondaries rule, and the proposed preferential treatment rule.
418 These
proposed amendments would help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and enforcement
capabilities.
Specifically, the proposed books and records amendments related to the quarterly
statement rule would require advisers to (i) retain a copy of any quarterly statement distributed to
fund investors as well as a record of each addressee, the date(s) the statement was sent,
address(es), and delivery method(s); (ii) retain all records evidencing the calculation method for

418 See proposed rule 204-2.
301
all expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, offsets, waivers, and performance listed on any
statement delivered pursuant to the proposed quarterly statement rule; and (iii) make and keep
books and records substantiating the adviser’s determination that the private fund it manages is a
liquid fund or an illiquid fund pursuant to the proposed quarterly statement rule.419
The proposed books and records amendments related to the proposed audit rule would
require advisers to keep a copy of any audited financial statements along with a record of each
addressee and the corresponding date(s) sent, address(es), and delivery method(s) for each such
addressee.420 Additionally, the proposed rule would require the adviser to keep a record
documenting steps it took to cause a private fund client with which it is not in a control
relationship to undergo a financial statement audit that would comply with the rule.
421
The proposed books and records amendments related to the proposed adviser-led
secondaries rule would require advisers to retain a copy of any fairness opinion and summary of
material business relationships distributed pursuant to the proposed rule along with a record of
each addressee and the corresponding date(s) sent, address(es), and delivery method(s) for each
such addressee.422
The proposed books and records amendments related to the proposed preferential
treatment rule would require advisers to retain copies of all written notices sent to current and
prospective investors in a private fund pursuant to rule 211(h)(2)-3.
423 In addition, advisers

419 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(20)(i) and (ii) and (a)(22).
420 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(21)(i).
421 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(21)(ii).
422 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(23).
423 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(7)(v).
302
would be required to retain copies of a record of each addressee and the corresponding dates
sent, addresses, and delivery method for each addressee.424
The respondents to these collections of information requirements would be investment
advisers that are registered or required to be registered with the Commission that advise one or
more private funds. Based on IARD data, as of November 30, 2021, there were 14,832
investment advisers registered with the Commission. According to this data, 5,037 registered
advisers provide advice to private funds.425 We estimate that these advisers would, on average,
each provide advice to 9 private funds.426 We further estimate that these private funds would, on
average, each have a total of 67 investors.427 As a result, an average private fund adviser would
have, on average, a total of 603 investors across all private funds it advises.
In our most recent PRA submission for rule 204-2,
428 we estimated for rule 204-2 a total
hour burden of 2,764,563 hours, and the total annual external cost burden is $175,980,426. This
collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.204-2 and is mandatory. The Commission staff
uses the collection of information in its examination and oversight program. As noted above,
responses provided to the Commission in the context of its examination and oversight program
concerning the proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would be kept confidential subject to the
provisions of applicable law.

Notes:

1. Hour burden and cost estimates for these proposed rule amendments assume the frequency of each collection of information for the substantive
rule with which they are associated. For example, the hour burden estimate for recordkeeping obligations associated with the amendments to
proposed rule 204-2(a)(20) and (22) would assume the same frequency of collection of information as under proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2.
2. See SIFMA Report, supra Note 1 to Table 1 Rule 211(h)(1)-2 PRA Estimates.
3. See supra section V.D.

A. Reasons for and Objectives of the Proposed Action
1. Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1
We are proposing new rule 211(h)(1)-1 under the Advises Act (the “definitions rule”),
which would contain numerous definitions for purposes of proposed rules 211(h)(1)-2, 206(4)-
10, 211(h)(2)-1, 211(h)(2)-2, and 211(h)(2)-3.430 We chose to include these definitions in a
single rule for ease of reference, consistency, and brevity.
2. Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2
We are proposing new rule 211(h)(1)-2 under the Advisers Act, which requires any
investment adviser registered or required to be registered with the Commission that provides
investment advice to a private fund that has at least two full calendar quarters of operating results
to prepare and distribute a quarterly statement to private fund investors that includes certain
standardized disclosures regarding the cost of investing in the private fund and the private fund’s
performance.431 We believe that providing this information to private fund investors in a simple
and clear format is appropriate and in the public interest and will improve investor protection and
investor decision making. The reasons for, and objectives of, proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2 are
discussed in more detail in section II.A, above. The burdens of this requirement on small
advisers are discussed below as well as above in sections V and VI, which discuss the burdens on
all advisers. The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens also are also
discussed in section VI.

430 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1.
431 See proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2.
307
3. Proposed rule 206(4)-10
We are proposing new rule 206(4)-10 under the Advisers Act, which would generally
require all investment advisers that are registered or required to be registered with the
Commission to have their private fund clients undergo a financial statement audit at least
annually and upon liquidation containing certain prescribed elements, which are described above
in section II.B. The proposed rule is designed to provide protection for the fund and its investors
against the misappropriation of fund assets and to provide an important check on the adviser’s
valuation of private fund assets, which often serve as the basis for the calculation of the adviser’s
fees. The reasons for, and objectives of, the proposed audit rule are discussed in more detail in
section II.B, above. The burdens of these requirements on small advisers are discussed below as
well as above in sections V and VI, which discuss the burdens on all advisers. The professional
skills required to meet these specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.
4. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1 would prohibit all private fund advisers from, directly or
indirectly, engaging in certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes
that are contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors. Specifically, the rule
would prohibit an adviser from: (1) charging certain fees and expenses to a private fund or
portfolio investment (including accelerated monitoring fees, fees or expenses associated with an
examination or investigation of the adviser or its related persons by governmental or regulatory
authorities, regulatory or compliance expenses or fees of the adviser or its related persons, or
fees and expenses related to a portfolio investment (or potential portfolio investment) on a nonpro rata basis when multiple private funds and other clients advised by the adviser or its related
persons have invested (or propose to invest) in the same portfolio investment); (2) reducing the
amount of any adviser clawback by the amount of certain taxes; (3) seeking reimbursement,
308
indemnification, exculpation, or limitation of its liability by the private fund or its investors for a
breach of fiduciary duty, willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence, or recklessness in providing
services to the private fund; and (4) borrowing money, securities, or other fund assets, or
receiving a loan or an extension of credit, from a private fund client.432 Each of these
prohibitions is described in more detail above in section II.D. As discussed above, we believe
that these sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes must be prohibited.
The proposed rule would prohibit these activities regardless of whether the private fund
documents permit such activities or the adviser otherwise discloses the practices and regardless
of whether the private fund investors have consented to the activities. Also, the proposed rule
would prohibit these activities even if they are performed indirectly, for example by an adviser’s
related persons, because the activities have an equal potential to harm investors regardless of
whether the adviser engages in the activity directly or indirectly. The reasons for, and objectives
of, the proposed rule are discussed in more detail in section II.D, above. The burdens of these
requirements on small advisers are discussed below as well as above in sections V and VI, which
discuss the burdens on all advisers. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens also are discussed in section VI.
5. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2
We are proposing new rule 211(h)(2)-2 under the Advisers Act, which generally would
make it unlawful for an adviser that is registered or required to be registered with the
Commission to complete an adviser-led secondary transaction with respect to any private fund,
where an adviser (or its related persons) offers fund investors the option to sell their interests in
the private fund, or to convert or exchange them for new interests in another vehicle advised by

432 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1(a).
309
the adviser or its related persons, unless the adviser, prior to the closing of the transaction,
distributes to investors in the private fund a fairness opinion from an independent opinion
provider and a summary of any material business relationships the adviser or any of its related
persons has, or has had within the past two years, with the independent opinion provider. The
specific requirements of the proposed rule are described above in section II.C. The proposed
rule is designed to provide an important check against an adviser’s conflicts of interest in
structuring and leading a transaction from which it may stand to profit at the expense of private
fund investors. The reasons for, and objectives of, the proposed rule are discussed in more detail
in section II.C above. The burdens of these requirements on small advisers are discussed below
as well as above in sections V and VI, which discuss the burdens on all advisers. The
professional skills required to meet these specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.
6. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3 would prohibit a private fund adviser, directly or indirectly,
from (1) granting an investor in a private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets the
ability to redeem its interest on terms that the adviser reasonably expects to have a material,
negative effect on other investors in that private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets;
or (2) providing information regarding the portfolio holdings or exposures of the private fund, or
of a substantially similar pool of assets, to any investor if the adviser reasonably expects that
providing the information would have a material, negative effect on other investors in that
private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets.
433 The proposed rule would also prohibit
these advisers from providing any other preferential treatment to any investor in a private fund

433 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3.
310
unless the adviser provides written disclosures to prospective and current investors in the private
fund regarding all preferential treatment the adviser or its related persons provided to other
investors in the same fund.434 These requirements are described above in section II.E. The
proposed rule is designed to eliminate sales practices that present a conflict of interest between
the adviser and the private fund client that are contrary to the public interest and protection of
investors. The disclosure elements of the proposed rule are designed to also help investors shape
the terms of their relationship with the adviser of the private fund. The reasons for, and
objectives of, the proposed rule are discussed in more detail in section II.E, above. The burdens
of these requirements on small advisers are discussed below as well as above in sections V and
VI, which discuss the burdens on all advisers. The professional skills required to meet these
specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.
7. Proposed amendments to rule 204-2
We are also proposing related amendments to rule 204-2, the books and records rule,
which sets forth various recordkeeping requirements for registered investment advisers. We are
proposing to amend the current rule to require investment advisers to private funds to make and
keep records relating to the quarterly statements required under proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2, the
financial statement audits performed under proposed rule 206(4)-10, fairness opinions required
under proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2, and disclosure of certain types of preferential treatment
required under proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3. The reasons for, and objectives of, the proposed
amendments to the books and records rule are discussed in more detail in sections II.A, II.B,
II.C, II.E, V, above. The burdens of these requirements on small advisers are discussed below as

434 See proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3(b).
311
well as above in sections V and VI, which discuss the burdens on all advisers. The professional
skills required to meet these specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.
8. Proposed amendments to rule 206(4)-(7)
We are proposing amendments to rule 206(4)-7 to require all SEC-registered advisers to
document the annual review of their compliance policies and procedures in writing, as described
above in section III. The proposed amendments are designed to focus renewed attention on the
importance of the annual compliance review process and would better enable our staff to
determine whether an adviser has complied with the review requirement of the compliance rule.
The reasons for, and objectives of, the proposed rule are discussed in more detail in section III,
above. The burdens of these requirements on small advisers are discussed below as well as
above in sections V and VI, which discuss the burdens on all advisers. The professional skills
required to meet these specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.
B. Legal Basis
The Commission is proposing new rules 211(h)(1)-2, 211(h)(2)-1, 211(h)(2)-2,
211(h)(2)-3, and 206(4)-10 under the Advisers Act under the authority set forth in sections
203(d), 206(4), 211(a), and 211(h) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-3(d),
80b-6(4) and 80b-11(a) and (h)). The Commission is proposing amendments to rule 204-2 under
the Advisers Act under the authority set forth in sections 204 and 211 of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-4 and 80b-11). The Commission is proposing amendments to rule
206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act under the authority set forth in sections 203(d), 206(4), and
211(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-3(d), 80b-6(4), and 80b-11(a)).
C. Small Entities Subject to Rules
In developing these proposals, we have considered their potential impact on small entities
that would be subject to the proposed rules and amendments. Some of the proposed rules and
312
amendments would affect many, but not all, investment advisers registered with the
Commission, including some small entities, the proposed amendments to rule 206(4)-7 would
affect all investment advisers that are registered, or required to be registered, with the
Commission, including some small entities, and proposed rules 211(h)(2)-1 and 211(h)(2)-3
would apply to all advisers to private funds (even if not registered), including some small
entities. Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 would affect all advisers, including all that are small entities,
regardless of whether they are registered or advise private funds. Under Commission rules, for
the purposes of the Advisers Act and the RFA, an investment adviser generally is a small entity
if it: (1) has assets under management having a total value of less than $25 million; (2) did not
have total assets of $5 million or more on the last day of the most recent fiscal year; and (3) does
not control, is not controlled by, and is not under common control with another investment
adviser that has assets under management of $25 million or more, or any person (other than a
natural person) that had total assets of $5 million or more on the last day of its most recent fiscal
year.435
Other than the proposed definitions rule, prohibitions rule and preferential treatment rule,
our proposed rules and amendments would not affect most investment advisers that are small
entities (“small advisers”) because those rules apply only to registered advisers, and small
registered advisers are generally registered with one or more state securities authorities and not
with the Commission. Under section 203A of the Advisers Act, most small advisers are
prohibited from registering with the Commission and are regulated by state regulators. Based on
IARD data, we estimate that as of November 30, 2021, approximately 594 SEC-registered

435 17 CFR 275.0-7(a) (Advisers Act rule 0-7(a)).
313
advisers are small entities under the RFA.436 All of these advisers would be affected by the
proposed amendments to the compliance rule, and we estimate that approximately 29 advise one
or more private funds and would, therefore, be affected by the proposed quarterly statement rule,
audit rule, and secondaries rule.
The proposed prohibited activities rule and the proposed preferential treatment rule,
however, would have an impact on all investment advisers to private funds, regardless of
whether they are registered with the Commission, one or more state securities authorities, or are
unregistered. It is difficult for us to estimate the number of advisers not registered with us that
have private fund clients. However, we are able to provide the following estimates based on
IARD data. As of November 30, 2021, there are 5,022 ERAs, all of whom advise private funds,
by definition.437 All ERAs would, therefore, be subject to the rules that would apply to all
private fund advisers. We estimate that there are no ERAs that would meet the definition of
“small entity.”438 We do not have a method for estimating the number of state-registered
advisers to private funds that would meet the definition of “small entity.”
Additionally, the proposed prohibited activities rule and the proposed preferential
treatment rule would apply to other advisers that are not registered with the SEC or with the
states and that do not make filings with either the SEC or states. This includes foreign private
advisers,439 advisers that are entirely unregistered, and advisers that rely on the intrastate
exemption from SEC registration and/or the de minimis exemption from SEC registration. We

436 Based on SEC-registered investment adviser responses to Items 5.F. and 12 of Form ADV.
437 See section 203(l) of the Advisers Act and 17 CFR 275.203(m)-1 (rule 203(m)-1 thereunder).
438 In order for an adviser to be an SEC ERA it would first need to have an SEC registration obligation, and an
adviser with that little in assets under management (i.e., assets under management that is low enough to allow
the adviser to qualify as a small entity) would not have an SEC registration obligation.
439 See section 202(a)(30) of the Advisers Act (defining “foreign private adviser”).
314
are unable to estimate the number of advisers in each of these categories because these advisers
do not file reports or other information with the SEC and we are unable to find reliable, public
information. As a result, our estimates are based on information from SEC-registered advisers to
private funds, exempt reporting advisers (at the state and Federal levels), and state-registered
advisers to private funds.
The proposed definitions rule would affect all advisers, but not unless the adviser is also
affected by one of the rules discussed above. It has no independent substantive requirements or
economic impacts. Therefore, the number of small advisers affected by this rule is accounted for
in those discussions and not separately and additionally delineated.
D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and other Compliance Requirements
1. Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1
Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1 would not impose any reporting, recordkeeping, or other
compliance requirements on investment advisers because it has no independent substantive
requirements or economic impacts. The rule would not affect an adviser unless it was complying
with proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2, 206(4)-10, 211(h)(2)-1, 211(h)(2)-2, or 211(h)(2)-3, each of
which is discussed below.
2. Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2
Proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2 would impose certain compliance requirements on investment
advisers, including those that are small entities. It would require any investment adviser
registered or required to be registered with the Commission that provides investment advice to a
private fund that has at least two full calendar quarters of operating results to prepare and
distribute quarterly statements with certain fee and expense and performance disclosure to
private fund investors. The proposed requirements, including compliance and related
recordkeeping requirements that would be required under the proposed amendments to rule 204-
315
2 and rule 206(4)-7, are summarized in this IRFA (section VII above). All of these proposed
requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in section II, and these requirements and the
burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in sections V
and VI (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below.
The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens are also discussed in section VI.
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers to private funds currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of these advisers would be subject to the
proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2. As discussed in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in section V
above, the proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2 under the Advisers Act, which would require advisers to
prepare and distribute quarterly statements, would create a new annual burden of approximately
130.5 hours per adviser, or 3,784.5 hours in aggregate for small advisers. We therefore expect
the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our proposed amendments
would be $1,802,466.
440
3. Proposed rule 206(4)-10
Proposed rule 206(4)-10 would impose certain compliance requirements on investment
advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered investment advisers that provide
investment advice, including small entity advisers, would be required to comply with the
proposed rule’s requirements to have their private fund clients undergo a financial statement
audit (at least annually and upon liquidation) and distribute audited financial statements to
private fund investors. The proposed requirements, including compliance and related
recordkeeping requirements that would be imposed under proposed amendments to rule 204-2

440 This includes the internal time cost and the annual external cost burden and assumes that, for purposes of the
annual external cost burden, 50% of small advisers will use outside legal services, as set forth in the PRA
estimates table.
316
and rule 206(4)-7, are summarized in this IRFA (section VII.A. above). All of these proposed
requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in section II, and these requirements and the
burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in sections V
and VI (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below.
The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens are also discussed in section VI.
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers to private funds currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of these advisers would be subject to the
proposed rule 206(4)-10. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in
section V above, proposed rule 206(4)-10 under the Advisers Act would create a new annual
burden of approximately 18.36 hours per adviser, or 532.44 hours in aggregate for small
advisers. We therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated
with our proposed amendments would be $15,819,118.65.
441
4. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1 would impose certain compliance requirements on investment
advisers, including those that are small entities. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1 would prohibit all
private fund advisers from engaging in certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and
compensation schemes that are contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors.
Specifically, the rule would prohibit an adviser from: (1) charging certain fees and expenses to a
private fund or portfolio investment (including accelerated monitoring fees, fees or expenses
associated with an examination or investigation of the adviser or its related persons by
governmental or regulatory authorities, regulatory or compliance expenses or fees of the adviser
or its related persons, or fees and expenses related to a portfolio investment (or potential

441 This includes the internal time cost and the annual external cost burden, as set forth in the PRA estimates table.
317
portfolio investment) on a non-pro rata basis when multiple private funds and other clients
advised by the adviser or its related persons have invested (or propose to invest) in the same
portfolio investment); (2) reducing the amount of any adviser clawback by the amount of certain
taxes; (3) seeking reimbursement, indemnification, exculpation, or limitation of its liability by
the private fund or its investors for a breach of fiduciary duty, willful misfeasance, bad faith,
negligence, or recklessness in providing services to the private fund; and (4) borrowing money,
securities, or other fund assets, or receiving a loan or an extension of credit from a private fund
client. All of these proposed requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in section II, and
these requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in section V (the Economic Analysis) and below.
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers to private funds currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of these advisers would be subject to the
proposed rule 211(h)(2)-1. As discussed above, we estimate that there are no ERAs that would
meet the definition of “small entity” and we do not have a method for estimating the number of
state-registered advisers to private funds that would meet the definition of “small entity.”442
5. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2 would impose certain compliance requirements on investment
advisers, including those that are small entities. The rule generally would make it unlawful for
an adviser that is registered or required to be registered with the Commission to complete an
adviser-led secondary transaction with respect to any private fund, where an adviser (or its
related persons) offers fund investors the option to sell their interests in the private fund, or to
convert or exchange them for new interests in another vehicle advised by the adviser or its

442 See supra section VI.C.
318
related persons, unless the adviser, prior to the closing of the transaction, distributes to investors
in the private fund a fairness opinion from an independent opinion provider and a summary of
any material business relationships the adviser or any of its related persons has, or has had within
the past two years, with the independent opinion provider . The proposed requirements,
including compliance and related recordkeeping requirements that would be imposed under
proposed amendments to rule 204-2 and 206(4)-7, are summarized in this IRFA (section VII
above). All of these proposed requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in section II, and
these requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in sections V and VI (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens also are discussed in section VI.
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers to private funds currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of these advisers would be subject to
proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in
section V above, proposed rule 211(h)(2)-2 under the Advisers Act would create a new annual
burden of approximately 7 hours per adviser, or 21 hours in aggregate for small advisers.443 We
therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our
proposed amendments would be $129,805.92.
444
6. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3
Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3 would impose certain compliance requirements on investment
advisers, including those that are small entities. Proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3 would prohibit a

443 Similar to the PRA analysis, we assume that 10% (~3) of all small advisers will conduct an adviser-led
secondary transaction on an annual basis.
444 This includes the internal time cost and the annual external cost burden, as set forth in the PRA estimates table.
319
private fund adviser, including indirectly through its related persons, from (1) granting an
investor in the private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets the ability to redeem its
interest on terms that the adviser reasonably expects to have a material, negative effect on other
investors in that private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets; and (2) providing
information regarding the private fund’s portfolio holdings or exposures of the private fund or of
a substantially similar pool of assets to any investor if the adviser reasonably expects that
providing the information would have a material, negative effect on other investors in that
private fund or in a substantially similar pool of assets. The rule would also prohibit these
advisers from providing any other preferential treatment to any investor in the private fund
unless the adviser provides written disclosures to prospective and current investors in the private
fund regarding all preferential treatment the adviser or its related persons provided to other
investors in the same fund. The proposed requirements, including compliance and related
recordkeeping requirements that would be imposed under proposed amendments to rule 204-2
and 206(4)-7, are summarized in this IRFA (section VII above). All of these proposed
requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in section II, and these requirements and the
burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in sections V
and VI (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below.
The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers to private funds currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of these advisers would be subject to the
proposed rule 211(h)(2)-3. As discussed above, we estimate that there are no ERAs that would
meet the definition of “small entity” and we do not have a method for estimating the number of
320
state-registered advisers to private funds that would meet the definition of “small entity.”445 As
discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in section VI above, proposed rule
211(h)(2)-3 under the Advisers Act would create a new annual burden of approximately 31.01
hours per adviser, or 899.29 hours in aggregate for small advisers.446 We therefore expect the
annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our proposed amendments
would be $374,569.51.
447
7. Proposed amendments to rule 204-2
The proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would impose certain recordkeeping
requirements on investment advisers to private funds, including those that are small entities. All
registered investment advisers to private funds, including small entity advisers, would be
required to comply with recordkeeping amendments. While all SEC-registered investment
advisers, and advisers that are required to be registered, are subject to rule 204-2 under the
Advisers Act, our proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would only impact private fund advisers
that are SEC registered. The proposed amendments are summarized in this IRFA (section VII
above). The proposed amendments are also discussed in detail, above, in section II, and the
requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in sections V and VI (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act

445 See supra section VI.C.
446 The following types of private fund advisers, among others, would be subject to the proposed rule: unregistered
advisers (i.e., advisers that are not SEC registered but have a registration obligation), foreign private advisers,
and advisers that rely on the intrastate exemption from SEC registration and/or the de minimis exemption from
SEC registration. However, we are unable to estimate the number of advisers in each of these categories
because these advisers do not file reports or other information with the SEC and we are unable to find reliable,
public information. As a result, the above estimate is based on information from SEC-registered advisers to
private funds, exempt reporting advisers (at the state and Federal levels), and state-registered advisers to private
funds. These figures are approximate.
447 This includes the internal time cost and the annual external cost burden and assumes that, for purposes of the
annual external cost burden, 75% of small advisers will use outside legal services, as set forth in the PRA
estimates table.
321
Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens also are discussed in section VI.
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers to private funds currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be
subject to the proposed amendments to rule 204-2. As discussed above in our Paperwork
Reduction Act Analysis in section VI above, the proposed amendments to rule 204-2 under the
Advisers Act, which would require advisers to retain certain copies of documents required under
proposed rules 206(4)-10, 211(h)(1)-2, 211(h)(2)-2, and 211(h)(2)-3 would create a new annual
burden of approximately 9 hours per adviser, or 261 hours in aggregate for small advisers. We
therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our
proposed amendments would be $17,748.
448
8. Proposed amendments to rule 206(4)-7
Proposed amendments to rule 206(4)-7 would impose certain compliance requirements
on investment advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered investment
advisers, and advisers that are required to be registered, would be required to document the
annual review of their compliance policies and procedures in writing. The proposed
requirements are summarized in this IRFA (section VII above). All of these proposed
requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in section III, and these requirements and the
burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in sections V
and VI (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below.
The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens also are discussed in section VI.

448 This includes the internal time cost and the annual external cost burden, as set forth in the PRA estimates table.
322
As discussed above, there are approximately 29 small advisers currently registered with
us, and we estimate that 100 percent of these advisers would be subject to the proposed
amendments to rule 206(4)-7. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in
section VI above, these amendments would create a new annual burden of approximately 3 hour
per adviser, or 87 hours in aggregate for small advisers. We therefore expect the annual
monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our proposed amendments would be
$44,921.
449
E. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules
There are no duplicative, overlapping, or conflicting Federal rules with respect to the
specific requirements of proposed rule 211(h)(1)-1, 211(h)(1)-2, 211(h)(2)-1, 211(h)(2)-2,
211(h)(2)-3, or the proposed amendments to rule 204-2 or rule 206(4)-7. We recognize that
private fund advisers are prohibited from making misstatements or materially misleading
statements to investors under rule 206(4)-8. To the extent there is any overlap between the
proposed rules and rule 206(4)-8, we believe that any additional costs to advisers to private funds
would be minimal, as they can assume that conduct that would raise issues under any of the
specific provisions of the proposed rules would also be prohibited under rule 206(4)-8. To the
extent there is any overlap between the requirements of proposed rule 211(h)(1)-2 and Form
ADV Part 2, it is minimal, and it is complementary, not contradictory. For example, Form ADV
Part 2 requires advisers to disclose what fees the adviser charges, such as a 2% management fee
based on its clients’ assets that it manages. The proposed rule would require advisers to disclose
what amount was actually charged to a private fund client (e.g., $200,000).

449 This includes the internal time cost and the annual external cost burden and assumes that, for purposes of the
annual external cost burden, 50% of small advisers will use outside legal services, as set forth in the PRA
estimates table.
323
There is significant duplication and overlap of the requirements of proposed rule 206(4)-
10 and rule 206(4)-2 because proposed rule 206(4)-10 is drawn from the option to comply with
rule 206(4)-2’s account statement and surprise examination requirements by having pooled
investment vehicle clients undergo a financial statement audit and distribute the financial
statements to the investors in the pools. Similarities between these rules should result in minimal
new compliance burdens for private fund advisers that have chosen to comply with the audit
provision of rule 206(4)-2, however. For private fund advisers that have not chosen to comply
with the audit provision of rule 206(4)-2, proposed rule 206(4)-10 will result in new compliance
burdens, but not ones that contradict rule 206(4)-2. These advisers can choose to mitigate, as
much as possible, their compliance burdens by electing to comply with rule 206(4)-2’s audit
provision in lieu of the account statement and surprise examination requirements, though this
option may be limited for some advisers if they also have clients for which the adviser is unable
to choose to rely on the audit provision of the custody rule. We believe these additional
compliance burdens are justified because an audit by an independent public accountant would
provide an important check on the adviser’s valuation of private fund assets, which often serve as
the basis for calculating the adviser’s fees.
F. Significant Alternatives
The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish the stated objective, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small
entities. In connection with the proposed rules and rule amendments, the Commission
considered the following alternatives: (i) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (ii) the
clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the
proposed rules and rule amendments for such small entities; (iii) the use of performance rather
324
than design standards; and (iv) an exemption from coverage of the proposed rules and rule
amendments, or any part thereof, for such small entities.
Regarding the first and fourth alternatives, we do not believe that differing compliance or
reporting requirements or an exemption from coverage of the proposed rules and rule
amendments, or any part thereof, for small entities, would be appropriate or consistent with
investor protection. Because the protections of the Advisers Act are intended to apply equally to
clients of both large and small advisory firms, it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the
Act to specify different requirements for small entities under the proposed rules and rule
amendments.
Regarding the second alternative, the proposed prohibited activities rule and the proposed
preferential treatment rule are particularly intended to provide clarification to all private fund
advisers, not just small advisers, as to what the Commission considers to be conduct that would
be prohibited under section 206 of the Act and contrary to the public interest and protection of
investors under section 211 of the Act. Despite our examination and enforcement efforts, this
type of inappropriate conduct persists; these proposed rules will provide clarity of our views of
this conduct to all private fund advisers. Similarly, we also have endeavored to consolidate and
simplify the compliance with both proposed rules, as well as disclosure requirements under the
proposed preferential treatment rule, for all private fund advisers.
Regarding the third alternative, we do not consider using performance rather than design
standards to be consistent with our statutory mandate of investor protection with respect to
preventing fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts, or inappropriate sales practices, conflicts
of interest or compensation schemes, by investment advisers.
325
G. Solicitation of Comments
We encourage written comments on matters discussed in this IRFA. In particular, the
Commission seeks comment on:
• the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed rule; and
• whether the effect of the proposed rule on small entities would be economically
significant.
Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any effect and provide empirical data
supporting the extent of the effect.
VIII. CONSIDERATION OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, or
“SBREFA,”450 we must advise OMB whether a proposed regulation constitutes a “major” rule.
Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it results in or is likely to result
in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or
prices for consumers or individual industries; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,
investment or innovation.
We request comment on the potential impact of the proposed rules and amendments on
the economy on an annual basis. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other
factual support for their views to the extent possible.
IX. STATUTORY AUTHORITY

adviser that is registered or required to be registered under section 203 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 shall prepare a quarterly statement that complies with paragraphs
(a) through (g) of this section for any private fund that it advises, directly or indirectly,
that has at least two full calendar quarters of operating results, and distribute the quarterly
statement to the private fund’s investors within 45 days after each calendar quarter end,
unless such a quarterly statement is prepared and distributed by another person.
(b) Fund table. The quarterly statement must include a table for the private fund that
discloses, at a minimum, the following information, presented both before and after the
application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers for the information required by paragraphs
(b)(1) and (2) of this section:

to the investment adviser or any of its related persons by the covered portfolio
investment during the reporting period, with separate line items for each category
of allocation or payment reflecting the total dollar amount, presented both before
and after the application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers; and
337
(2) The fund’s ownership percentage of each such covered portfolio investment as of
the end of the reporting period, or zero, if the fund does not have an ownership
interest in the covered portfolio investment, along with a brief description of the
fund’s investment.
(d) Calculations and cross references. The quarterly statement must include prominent
disclosure regarding the manner in which all expenses, payments, allocations, rebates,
waivers, and offsets are calculated and include cross references to the sections of the
private fund’s organizational and offering documents that set forth the applicable
calculation methodology.
(e) Performance. (1) No later than the time the adviser sends the initial quarterly
statement, the adviser must determine that the private fund is an illiquid fund or a liquid
fund.
(2) The quarterly statement must present the following with equal prominence:

illiquid fund through the end of the quarter covered by the quarterly
statement (or, to the extent quarter-end numbers are not available at

the time the adviser distributes the quarterly statement, through the
most recent practicable date) and computed without the impact of any
fund-level subscription facilities:
(1) Gross IRR and gross MOIC for the illiquid fund;
(2) Net IRR and net MOIC for the illiquid fund;
(3) Gross IRR and gross MOIC for the realized and unrealized
portions of the illiquid fund’s portfolio, with the realized and
unrealized performance shown separately; and
(4) A statement of contributions and distributions for the illiquid fund.
(B) [Reserved]
(iii) The quarterly statement must include the date as of which the performance
information is current through and prominent disclosure of the criteria used
and assumptions made in calculating the performance.
(f) Consolidated reporting. To the extent doing so would provide more meaningful
information to the private fund’s investors and would not be misleading, the adviser must
consolidate the reporting required by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to cover
substantially similar pools of assets.
(g) Format and content. The quarterly statement must use clear, concise, plain English and
be presented in a format that facilitates review from one quarterly statement to the next.

taxes applicable to the adviser, its related persons, or their respective owners or
interest holders;

the private fund or its investors for a breach of fiduciary duty, willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence, or recklessness in providing services to the
private fund;
(6) Charge or allocate fees and expenses related to a portfolio investment (or potential
portfolio investment) on a non-pro rata basis when multiple private funds and
other clients advised by the adviser or its related persons have invested (or
propose to invest) in the same portfolio investment; and
(7) Borrow money, securities, or other private fund assets, or receive a loan or an
extension of credit, from a private fund client.

Reopening of Comment Period for Pay Versus Performance
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule; reopening of comment period.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is reopening the
comment period for its proposal to implement Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The proposed rule would
amend the current executive compensation disclosure rule to require a description of how
executive compensation actually paid by a registrant related to the financial performance of that
company (“Proposed Rules”). The Proposed Rules were first set forth in a release published in
the Federal Register on May 7, 2015 (Release No. 34-74835) (“Proposing Release”), and the
related comment period ended on July 6, 2015. The reopening of this comment period is
intended to allow interested persons further opportunity to analyze and comment upon the
Proposed Rules in light of developments since the publication of the Proposing Release and our
further consideration of the Section 953(a) mandate, including by responding to the additional
requests for comment included in this release.
DATES: The comment period for the proposed rule published May 7, 2015, at 80 FR 26329, is
reopened. Comments should be received on or before March 4, 2022.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. BACKGROUND
Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 14(i) to the Securities Exchange Act
of 19341 (“Exchange Act”). Section 14(i) requires that the Commission adopt rules requiring
issuers to disclose in any proxy or consent solicitation material for an annual meeting of
shareholders a clear description of any compensation required to be disclosed under 17 CFR
229.402 (“Item 402 of Regulation S-K”), including information that shows the relationship
between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the issuer, taking
into account any change in the value of the shares of stock and dividends of the issuer and any
distributions. Section 14(i) further provides that the disclosure may include a graphic
representation of the information required to be disclosed.
As described more fully in the Proposing Release,2 the Proposed Rules would add new
17 CFR 229.402(v) (“Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K”), which would require registrants to
describe how the executive compensation actually paid by the registrant related to the financial
performance of the registrant over the time horizon of the disclosure. The Proposed Rules would
use cumulative total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined in 17 CFR 229.201(e) (“Item 201(e)
of Regulation S-K”),
3 as the measure of financial performance. Under the Proposed Rules, the
 1 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.
2 See Pay Versus Performance, Release No. 34-74835 (Apr. 29, 2015) [80 FR 26329 (May 7, 2015)].
3 Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K sets forth the specific disclosure requirements for the issuer’s stock performance
graph, which is required to be included in the annual report to security holders required by 17 CFR 240.14a-3
and 240.14c-3. The Item provides that cumulative total shareholder return is calculated by “dividing the sum of
the cumulative amount of dividends for the measurement period, assuming dividend reinvestment, and the
difference between the registrant’s share price at the end and the beginning of the measurement period; by the
share price at the beginning of the measurement period.”

Specifically, the Proposed Rules would:
• Apply to a registrant’s “named executive officers” (“NEOs”) as defined in 17 CFR
229.402(a)(3);
6
 4 A “smaller reporting company” means an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a
majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting company and that: (1) had a public float of
less than $250 million (as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter);
or (2) had annual revenues of less than $100 million (as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which
audited financial statements are available) and either: (i) no public float (as of the last business day of the
issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter); or (ii) a public float of less than $700 million (as of the
last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter). 17 CFR 240.12b-2. Business
development companies, which are a type of closed-end investment company that is not registered under the
Investment Company Act, do not fall within the SRC definition.
5 The Commission amended the SRC definition effective September 2018. See Amendments to the Smaller
Reporting Company Definition, Release No. 33-10513 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 31992 (July 10, 2018)]. Based
on staff analysis of filings in 2019, approximately 45 percent of registrants subject to the Proposed Rules would
be SRCs and thus would be exempt from the asterisked disclosure, compared to approximately 40 percent at the
time of publication of the Proposed Rules. Estimates based on 2020 filings would reflect a more modest change
in the proportion of SRCs, but may undercount SRCs due to a greater number of registrants, particularly small
ones, being late to file than in prior years.
6 17 CFR 229.402(a)(3) defines the NEOs for whom Item 402 of Regulation S-K executive compensation is
required as 1) all individuals serving as the registrant’s principal executive officer (“PEO”) or acting in a similar
capacity during the last completed fiscal year, regardless of compensation level, 2) all individuals serving as the
registrant’s principal financial officer (“PFO”) or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal
year, regardless of compensation level, 3) the registrant’s three most highly compensated executive officers
other than the PEO and PFO who were serving as executive officers at the end of the last completed fiscal year,
and 4) up to two additional individuals for whom Item 402 of Regulation S-K disclosure would have been
provided but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of the registrant at the end of
the last completed fiscal year. For SRCs, the Proposed Rules would apply to the scaled number of NEOs
included in 17 CFR 229.402(m)(2).
5
• Address the Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act required measure of “executive
compensation actually paid” (emphasis added) by using, as a starting point, the total
compensation that is already required to be disclosed in the Summary Compensation
Table.
7 For the PEO, the total PEO compensation from the Summary Compensation
Table would be disclosed in column (b) of the new table; and, for NEOs, the average
of their total compensation from the Summary Compensation Table would be
disclosed in column (d) of the new table. The following two adjustments to the
disclosure in the Summary Compensation Table would be made to determine the
executive compensation amounts “actually paid” (columns (c) and (e) of the new
table):
1. Exclude changes in actuarial present value of benefits under defined benefit
and actuarial pension plans that are not attributable to the applicable year of
service8
; and
2. Include the value of equity awards at vesting rather than when granted.
• Require the executive compensation amounts actually paid to be presented separately
for the PEO, and as an average for the remaining NEOs;
• Require a registrant’s TSR, as defined in Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K, and the TSR
of the registrant’s peer group as measures of financial performance (columns (f) and
(g) of the new table);
 7 17 CFR 229.402(c). SRCs would provide the scaled Summary Compensation Table disclosure in 17 CFR
229.402(n).
8 As proposed, SRCs would not be required to disclose and exclude amounts related to pensions for purposes of
disclosing executive compensation actually paid because they are subject to scaled compensation disclosure that
does not include pension plans.
6
• Require a registrant to use the information in the above table to provide a clear
description of (1) the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to
the registrant’s NEOs and the cumulative TSR of the registrant, and (2) the
relationship between the registrant’s TSR and the TSR of a peer group chosen by the
registrant, in each case over the registrant’s five most recently completed fiscal years;
• For SRCs, require the disclosure of the relationship between executive compensation
actually paid and TSR over the registrant’s three most recently completed fiscal
years, without requiring these registrants to provide disclosure of peer group TSR;
and
• Require that the disclosure be provided in a structured data language using the Inline
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“Inline XBRL”).
9
Registrants would also be permitted to provide supplemental measures of compensation
and/or financial performance, or other supplemental disclosures, so long as any additional
disclosure is clearly identified, not misleading and not presented with greater prominence than
the required disclosure.
The Commission proposed applying the rule to all reporting companies except foreign
private issuers, registered investment companies, and Emerging Growth Companies (“EGCs”).10
 9 In 2015, the Commission proposed requiring the structured, machine-readable eXtensible Business Reporting
Language (“XBRL”) for the tagging requirements in the Proposed Rule. The Commission subsequently
adopted rules replacing XBRL tagging requirements for registrant financial statements with Inline XBRL
tagging requirements. As a result of those changes, we are considering using Inline XBRL, rather than XBRL,
for the proposed tagging requirements. See infra footnote 25.
10 “Emerging growth company” means an issuer that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion
during its most recently completed fiscal year. An issuer that is an emerging growth company as of the first day
of that fiscal year shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day
of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the
last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common
equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
[15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.]; (iii) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous three year period, issued

II. REOPENING OF COMMENT PERIOD
Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010 and the Proposed Rules were
published in 2015. Since the Proposed Rules were published, executive compensation practices
related to company performance have continued to develop and evolve,11 to the point that we
believe interested persons should be given a further opportunity to analyze and comment upon
the Proposed Rules. In addition, as described below, we are considering whether additional
requirements would better implement the Section 953(a) mandate by providing investors with
additional decision-relevant data.
Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act does not specify how to measure an issuer’s
“financial performance.” However, the statutory language requires that “financial performance

more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large
accelerated filer. 17 CFR 240.12b-2. Section 102(a)(2) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act amended
Exchange Act Section 14(i) to exclude registrants that are EGCs from the pay-versus-performance disclosure
requirements. Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306 (2012). In accordance with this provision, the Commission
did not propose to require EGCs to provide pay-versus-performance disclosure. As proposed, business
development companies would be treated in the same manner as issuers other than registered investment
companies and, therefore, would be subject to the disclosure requirement of proposed new Item 402(v) of
Regulation S-K.
11 For example, there has been a continued increase in the prevalence of performance-contingent share plans and a
decrease in the use of stock options to compensate CEOs among S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies. See,
e.g., Pay Governance (Jan. 2021), S&P 500 CEO Compensation Increase Trends, available at
www.paygovernance.com/viewpoints/s-p-500-ceo-compensation-increase-trends-4; and Gallagher (February
2021), CEO and Executive Compensation Practices Report: 2020 Edition, available at www.ajg.com/us/newsand-insights/2021/feb/ceo-executive-compensation-practices-report-2020/. See also, Meridian Compensation
Partners, LLC, 2020 Trends and Developments in Executive Compensation (April 30, 2020), available at
https://www.meridiancp.com/wp-content/uploads/Meridian-2020-Trends-and-Developments-Survey-Final.pdf
(summarizing responses to a survey from 108 companies, and discussing, among other developments, a decline
in the use of TSR as the sole performance metric in long-term incentive plans, from 47% in 2016 to 30% in
2020, and the recent use by some companies of TSR as a modifier to results initially determined by one or more
other financial metrics). Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected both how and the extent to which
companies recently have tied executive compensation to company performance. See, e.g., A. Batish, et al.,
Sharing the Pain: How Did Boards Adjust CEO Pay in Response to COVID-19?, Rock Center for Corporate
Governance at Stanford University Closer Look Series: Topics, Issues and Controversies in Corporate
Governance No. CGRP-86 (Sep. 1, 2020), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=3682766 (analyzing
compensation disclosure from all Russell 3000 companies between January 1 and June 30, 2020, and finding
“502 companies (17 percent) made adjustments to CEO salary, bonus, or long-term incentive programs (LTIPs),
or director fees during this measurement period,” with 92 companies making adjustments to annual bonus
programs and 33 companies making changes to their long-term incentive programs).

… [take] into account any change in the value of the shares of stock and dividends of the issuer
and any distributions.” Consistent with this language, the Commission proposed requiring TSR
(as defined in Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K) as the measure of “financial performance” of the
registrant. The Commission also proposed TSR because, among other reasons, it is:
• Consistently calculated and should increase comparability across registrants;
• Objectively determinable and not open to subjective determinations of performance; and
• A measure for which disclosure is already required and with which shareholders are
familiar, so its use was intended to mitigate the burdens both to registrants to provide the
disclosure and to investors to analyze the new disclosure.
We are considering requiring registrants to disclose, in addition to their TSR and the TSR
of their peer group, certain other measures of performance, which could provide additional
clarity to investors as to the relation between executive compensation and financial performance.
Specifically, we are considering requiring disclosure in tabular form of the following three
additional measures: pre-tax net income, net income, and a measure specific to a particular
registrant, chosen by said registrant (the “Company-Selected Measure”). As noted in the
Proposing Release, registrants would be required to provide a clear description of the
relationship among the measures provided in the tabular form (including these three additional
measures we are considering requiring), but would be allowed to choose the format used to
present the relationship, such as a graph or narrative description.
The first two additional measures of financial performance under consideration – pre-tax
net income and net income – are already provided for under U.S. Generally Accepted
9
Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”)12 and, accordingly, are familiar to investors and
registrants. We are considering whether to require registrants to disclose these measures in two
additional columns to the table described in the Proposing Release and shown above. Because
these measures reflect a registrant’s overall profits and are net of costs and expenses, we believe
they are additional important measures of company financial performance that may be relevant
to investors in evaluating executive compensation. We believe using a company’s pre-tax net
income and net income could complement the market-based performance measure required in
the Proposing Release by also providing accounting-based measures of financial performance.
To the extent that these measures would otherwise be considered by investors when evaluating
the alignment of pay with performance, including pre-tax net income and net income as
additional measures of performance in the proposed table may lower the burden of analysis for
those investors by presenting this existing information together in a way that could make it easier
to understand how pay relates to performance.
We are also considering whether to require registrants to disclose, as an additional
column to the above table, a third new measure – the Company-Selected Measure – that in the
registrant’s assessment represents the most important performance measure (that is not already
included in the table)13 used by the registrant to link compensation actually paid during the fiscal
year to company performance, over the time horizon of the disclosure. We believe that requiring
 12 Net income is required to be disclosed in financial statements. While some registrants are not explicitly
required to present pre-tax net income in their financial statements, U.S. GAAP includes presentation and
disclosure requirements that result in information sufficient to calculate pre-tax net income, and these
registrants often do present pre-tax net income.
13 If the registrant’s most important performance measure were already included in the table, the registrant would
disclose its next-most important measure as its Company-Selected Measure. For example, if the registrant’s
most important measure were TSR, its second most important measure were pre-tax net income, and its third
most important measure were EBITDA, the registrant would include EBITDA as its Company-Selected
Measure. If a registrant did not use any measures other than those already included in the table, it would
indicate that fact in its disclosure.
10
registrants to select their own measure rather than mandating a further specific measure may
elicit additional useful disclosure while reducing the risk, identified by commenters on the
Proposing Release,14 of misrepresenting or providing an incomplete picture of how pay relates to
performance given the differences across companies in terms of performance measures that
companies or investors care about and the questions about whether a “one size fits all”
benchmark is appropriate for all companies.
For reference, the three additional measures we are considering requiring would be part
of the table in the Proposed Rules as follows:

In addition to potentially including the Company-Selected Measure in the table described
in the Proposing Release, we are considering whether to separately require registrants to provide
a list of their five most important performance measures used by the registrant to link
compensation actually paid during the fiscal year to company performance, over the time horizon
 14 See, e.g., letters from Business Roundtable dated July 6, 2015, Celanese Corp. dated June 12, 2015, Steven Hall
& Partners dated July 6, 2015, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. dated June 10, 2015, PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc. dated July 6, 2015, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP dated July 6, 2015 (each
opposing the use of TSR as the sole measure of financial performance and suggesting providing registrants the
ability to choose their own performance measure). Comment letters received in response to the Proposing
Release are available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-07-15/s70715.shtml. In addition, in a review of the
CD&As of around 20 of the largest Fortune 500 companies, the staff noted that, among these companies, there
were over 100 unique performance measures, almost all of which were company-specific or adjusted measures.
15 The title of column (j) of the table, “Company-Selected Measure,” would be replaced with the name of the
registrant’s most important measure, and that column would include the numerically quantifiable performance
of the issuer under such measure for each covered fiscal year. For example, if the Company Selected Measure
for the most recent fiscal year was EBITDA, the company would disclose its quantified EBITDA performance
in each covered fiscal year. The asterisked items indicate disclosures we are considering not requiring SRCs to
provide. See below for a discussion of our considerations with respect to SRC disclosure requirements.
11
of the disclosure, in order of importance. If the registrant considers fewer than five performance
measures when it links compensation actually paid during the fiscal year to company
performance, the registrant would be required to disclose only the number of measures it actually
considers.
16 We are considering whether to require this list to be in a tabular format. We note
that some commenters to the Proposing Release suggested revising the Proposed Rules to
require, in addition to TSR, the quantitative metrics or key performance targets companies
actually use to set executive pay.17 Currently, the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
(“CD&A”) requirements in Item 402 of Regulation S-K include requiring a registrant to explain
all material elements of the compensation paid to its NEOs.18 The item further specifies that
examples of this material information may include how executive compensation relates to
company performance such as:
• What specific items of corporate performance are taken into account in setting
compensation policies and making compensation decisions;
• How specific forms of compensation are structured and implemented to reflect these
items of corporate performance; and
• How specific forms of compensation are structured and implemented to reflect the NEOs’
individual performance and/or individual contribution to these items of the company’s
performance.19
 16 Throughout this release, we reference the “five” most important performance measures. If the registrant
considers fewer than five performance measures, all references to the “five” most important performance
measures should be read as the number of performance measures the registrant considers, if less than five.
17 See, e.g., letters from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations dated June
30, 2015, Council of Institutional Investors dated June 25, 2015, and Public Citizen dated July 6, 2015.
18 See 17 CFR 229.402(b)(1).
19 These specific examples are set forth in 17 CFR 229.402(b)(2)(v) through (vii).
12
Generally, discussion of these topics in the CD&A tends to be prospective in nature and
focused on the design of the registrant’s compensation program. However, there is no existing
rule that specifically mandates disclosure of the performance measures that actually determined
the level of recent NEO compensation actually paid. Tabular disclosure of a list of the five most
important performance measures that drove compensation actually paid may be useful to
investors in addition to the more detailed disclosure related to the consideration of the
registrant’s corporate performance and individual performance in the design of NEO
compensation required in the CD&A. This tabular disclosure may enable investors to more
easily assess which performance metrics actually have the most impact on compensation actually
paid and make their own judgments as to whether compensation appropriately incentivizes
management. The disclosure of the five most important performance measures that drove
compensation actually paid may also provide investors with context that could be useful in
interpreting the remainder of the pay versus performance disclosure.
For reference, we are considering requiring the five performance measures, as applicable,
to be disclosed in the following tabular format:
Five Most Important Company Performance
Measures for Determining NEO compensation
1. Measure 1
2. Measure 2
3. Measure 3
4. Measure 4
5. Measure 5
In our consideration of such a tabular requirement, we note that registrants would be able
to cross-reference to existing disclosures elsewhere in the disclosure document that describe the
13
various processes and calculations that go into determining NEO compensation as it relates to
these performance measures, if they elected to do so.
We believe that including a tabular list of those performance measures that drove recent
compensation actually paid may help address concerns that using only TSR may mislead
investors or provide an incomplete picture of performance. In addition, as referenced above with
respect to the Company-Selected Measure, we believe the inclusion of a registrant’s five most
important performance measures may better reflect the differences across companies.
We believe that the Proposed Rules, along with the additional disclosures we are
considering, as detailed above, may facilitate the analysis of registrants’ executive compensation
actually paid in relation to company performance. In particular, as discussed above, each of the
additional disclosures under consideration may broaden the picture of financial performance
presented in the disclosure. This additional detail and context could enhance the usefulness of
the disclosure by certain registrants or for certain investors. We recognize that the benefits of
such disclosure would depend on the degree to which the elements of the disclosure align with
the factors that investors seek to understand when considering pay in relation to performance.
As is the case with the Proposed Rules, we recognize that it is possible that shareholders
may bear information processing costs resulting from any additional elements required to be
included in the disclosure, if the new requirements increase the length and complexity of existing
disclosures without significantly adding to the ease of interpretation. The additional elements
under consideration could also reduce the benefits of the disclosure required by the Proposed
14
Rules if they complicate or obscure the elements of the proposed disclosure that would be most
helpful to investors.
We also acknowledge that each additional requirement could increase reporting costs for
registrants. However, we believe the costs to registrants of providing the disclosures we are
considering in addition to those described in the Proposed Rules likely would be relatively low.
Specifically, pre-tax net income and net income are generally presented in the financial
statements of registrants, and, therefore, we believe there should be minimal additional costs to
include those measures in the proposed new table. That said, prescribing additional measures
whose relation to compensation must be clearly described increases the cost of producing the
disclosure as well as the risk that some of these measures may not be as relevant for some issuers
and that these issuers may therefore feel the need to include clarifying disclosures. The
Company-Selected Measure and the other four most important performance measures are already
considered by registrants in making executive compensation determinations and may already be
discussed, in a different form, in the CD&A. While identifying and ranking the CompanySelected Measure and the other four measures may require some incremental consideration and
additional computations, we expect that their disclosure should result in limited additional costs,
though registrants with more complex compensation packages involving more performance
measures may bear relatively greater costs.
As is the case with the Proposed Rules, we expect the effect of the additional disclosures
we are considering to have limited other effects on efficiency, competition and capital formation.
If the proposed disclosures were either to facilitate or complicate the task of understanding
executive pay policies, they may marginally increase or decrease the informational efficiency of
markets, respectively. The proposed amendments and the additional disclosures we are
15
considering could also lead to indirect effects if the disclosures lead to changes in compensation
packages. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we believe such changes are unlikely due to
the high level of existing attention to pay practices and the limited new information that would
be disclosed. Finally, the disclosure of the ranking of the list of the most important performance
measures could negatively affect competition if this information is sensitive and has competitive
value.
To address concerns about burdens on smaller registrants, we are considering whether
and how the proposed rules and the potential disclosure of additional measures we are
considering would apply to SRCs. Under existing rules, SRCs are subject to abbreviated
executive compensation disclosure requirements.20 For example, SRCs are not required to
provide a CD&A but are instead permitted to produce a more limited, narrative disclosure. To
minimize costs for SRCs and consistent with the treatment of SRCs in many other areas, the
Commission proposed permitting SRCs to provide scaled disclosure under the Proposed Rules.
For example, and as indicated by the asterisked portions of the table described in the Proposing
Release and shown above in Section I of this release, under the Proposed Rules, SRCs would not
be required to provide the peer group TSR, as they are exempt from providing this disclosure
under existing rules.21
With respect to the potential disclosure of additional measures, pre-tax net income and
net income are already provided for under U.S. GAAP, and therefore we are considering
requiring SRCs to disclose such measures. In contrast, the current abbreviated executive
compensation disclosure requirements applicable to SRCs do not require them to provide a
 20 See 17 CFR 229.402(l) through (r).
21 See Instructions to Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K.
16
CD&A, and thus do not specifically call for disclosure about how executive compensation relates
to company performance. Accordingly, and unlike other reporting companies, requiring SRCs to
disclose a Company-Selected Measure and a list of their five most important performance
measures would be a new disclosure obligation that SRCs would not be able to satisfy by
drawing upon or cross-referencing to existing disclosures. We therefore are considering not
requiring SRCs to disclose a Company-Selected Measure and a list of their five most important
performance measures.
In light of developments in executive compensation practices related to company
performance since the publication of the Proposing Release, and our further consideration of how
best to implement the mandate of Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are reopening the
comment period for the Proposed Rules until March 4, 2022 to provide the public with an
additional opportunity to analyze and comment on the Proposed Rules as well as the additional
measures we are considering. Commenters may submit, and the Commission will consider,
comments on any aspect of the Proposed Rules or the additional measures we are considering.
All comments received to date on the Proposed Rules will be considered and need not be
resubmitted. Comments are particularly helpful if accompanied by quantified estimates or other
detailed analysis and supporting data about the issues addressed in those comments. In addition
to the requests for comment included in the Proposing Release, the Commission specifically
seeks comments on the following:
Request for Comment
1. Should disclosure of additional financial performance measures beyond TSR be required?
Specifically, would investors find it useful to have pre-tax net income and net income presented
in tabular format alongside the other metrics that would be required by the Proposing Release?
17
Would these two additional metrics help investors to appropriately evaluate the relationship
between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant?
Would the inclusion of these measures alleviate concerns previously raised by commenters on
the Proposed Rules about including only TSR and peer group TSR in this disclosure? Would
their inclusion complicate the disclosure such that its usefulness could be reduced? Should we
also require that these measures, if any, be discussed in the required description (which may be,
e.g., narrative or graphical) that accompanies the tabular disclosure? Instead of requiring
additional financial performance measures, should we instead include pre-tax net income and net
income as examples of additional measures registrants could elect to disclose if they believed
such disclosure would be beneficial for them? What would the benefits or drawbacks be of that
approach?
2. Are there other measures of company performance that we should consider mandating in
addition to or in lieu of pre-tax net income and/or net income? If so, which additional or
alternative measures should we require and why? How would these additional or alternative
measures be useful for investors in measuring company performance? Should we also require
that these measures, if any, be discussed in the required description (which may be, e.g.,
narrative or graphical) that accompanies the tabular disclosure?
3. How should we define the Company-Selected Measure, if we were to require its
disclosure? We are considering defining the Company-Selected Measure as the measure that in
the registrant’s assessment represents the most important performance measure (that is not
already included in the table) used by the registrant to link compensation actually paid during the
fiscal year to company performance. Would such a definition provide sufficient clarity to a
registrant as to what to disclose? What computations or considerations would be required in
18
determining the Company-Selected Measure and what would be the associated costs for
registrants? Should we require registrants to disclose the methodology used to calculate the
Company-Selected Measure? Should that consideration depend on whether the measure is
already disclosed in the Company’s financial statements?
4. Should we require the Company-Selected Measure to be the most important measure
used by the registrant in a performance or market condition in the context of an incentive plan as
defined in 17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(iii)?22 Would including such a measure in the tabular
disclosure allow investors to better evaluate the extent to which the total compensation reported
as actually paid reflects the performance the company explicitly chose to incentivize, and if so
would such an evaluation be useful to investors? Should the Company-Selected Measure instead
be the performance measure that is deemed most important by the registrant whether or not it is
used in a performance or market condition in the context of an incentive plan (i.e., including the
effect of stock price movements on equity incentive plan compensation, even in the absence of a
market condition; or measures that affect non-incentive plan compensation, such as the
retrospective use of performance measures in determining compensation reportable in the bonus
column of the Summary Compensation Table23)?
5. We recognize that there could be varying methods of evaluating which measures are the
most important. Should we define “most important” for the purpose of the selection of the
Company-Selected Measure, as well as for the ranking of any other measures, if required? If so,
how? For example, should the “most important” measure be the one on which the highest
 22 See also Release No. 33-8732A, Executive Compensation and Related Person Disclosure (Aug. 29, 2006) [71
FR 53158] (“2006 Adopting Release”) at n. 167 (discussing the use of performance conditions and market
conditions in equity incentive plans).
23 See 2006 Adopting Release at Section II.C.1.f for a discussion of the distinction between compensation
reportable as bonuses and compensation reportable as non-equity incentive plan compensation.
19
aggregate dollars of compensation actually paid were contingent? Or should “importance” be
based on the dollar impact of the measure’s variation from its initial or expected level on
compensation actually paid, whether positive or negative? Instead, should “importance” be
weighed based on what considerations drove the registrant’s executive compensation decisions
rather than its executive compensation outcomes? Alternatively, should we not specify a
particular method to use to evaluate the relative importance of a performance measure in driving
compensation actually paid or define “most important,” and instead allow registrants to
determine what they consider to be “important” for this purpose and select the CompanySelected Measure accordingly, with disclosure explaining how they made their choice? Instead
of requiring that the “most important” measure be the measure generally used by the registrant to
link compensation actually paid to company performance, should we require that the “most
important” measure be the measure specifically used by the registrant to link only PEO
compensation actually paid to company performance? What would the benefits and drawbacks
be of narrowing the definition of “most important” to only PEO compensation?
6. What disclosure should be required if different measures are important in different years
or if different measures determine compensation actually paid for the different NEOs? Would
aggregating the NEOs for purposes of determining the most important measure be difficult,
given that some NEOs may have their compensation linked to industry- or segment-specific
performance measures, which are not used for other NEOs? If so, are there ways to mitigate
these differences to provide useful disclosures for investors? What if different measures
contribute equally to determining compensation actually paid? If the measure deemed most
important is already included among the performance measures in the Proposed Rules or among
the additional measures we are considering in this release, should the company be permitted to
20
designate that measure as the Company-Selected Measure, or should the company be required to
disclose an additional significant measure, such as the next-most important measure not already
disclosed, as the Company-Selected Measure? What would the impact of either approach be on
the usefulness of disclosure of the Company-Selected Measure? If we permit a registrant to
designate TSR, peer group TSR, pre-tax net income, or net income as the Company-Selected
Measure, or if a registrant did not use any measures other than those already included in the
table, how should it indicate that fact in its disclosure? For example, should the registrant be
required to include in the Company-Selected Measure column duplicate disclosure of the
measure already included in the table, or should the registrant be required to include a note to the
measure already included in the table indicating that measure is also the registrant’s CompanySelected Measure?
7. Would mandated disclosure of the Company-Selected Measure be useful to investors
when placed alongside the metrics that would be required by the Proposing Release? How
would these benefits, if any, compare to those of any supplemental financial performance
measures that would voluntarily be disclosed by registrants in the absence of such a mandate?
Would there be challenges to registrants to presenting information about the Company-Selected
Measure in tabular form? If so, how could we elicit comparable disclosure while also allowing
registrants flexibility in presenting this information to accommodate their particular facts and
circumstances? Is there another format we should consider for the Company-Selected Measure?
Should we specifically limit any Company-Selected Measure only to those measures that relate
to the financial performance of the registrant? Or should we allow the Company-Selected
measure to be any measure that could be disclosed under the existing CD&A requirements,
including financial performance measures; environmental, social and governance related
21
measures; or any other measures used by the registrant to link compensation actually paid during
the fiscal year to company performance?
8. We are considering requiring the one Company-Selected Measure that is the most
important measure over the time horizon of the disclosure to be identified in the table, and
issuers would provide information about that measure, including the numerically quantifiable
performance of the issuer with respect to that measure, for all of the years in the table. Would
investors find such a presentation useful? Would there be challenges to registrants to presenting
this information for all years? Should we instead allow companies to change their CompanySelected Measure from year to year, such that they would disclose in the table a potentially
different Company-Selected Measure for each respective year? Would doing so have any impact
on investors’ ability to understand how pay relates to performance and compare across different
years? If we do require a registrant to disclose one Company-Selected Measure to be identified
in the table, and that registrant elects to change what that measure is in consecutive years, should
we require that registrant to separately disclose in additional columns, or narratively, the
Company-Selected Measures used in the table in prior years? How often do registrants change,
from year to year, their primary performance measures used by the registrant to link executive
compensation during a fiscal year to company performance?
9. Would a tabular list of a registrant’s five most important performance measures used to
determine compensation actually paid be useful to investors in addition to existing disclosures?
As in the case of the Company-Selected Measure above, how should we define “importance” and
how should performance measures be ranked for this purpose, particularly if multiple
performance targets apply to the same elements of compensation? Should we require disclosure
of the five most important performance measures or some other number of performance
22
measures? Would the inclusion of an additional tabular list of a registrant’s five most important
performance measures dilute the impact of, or otherwise lead to confusion regarding, the table
that would be required by the Proposing Release? Should we require that the five measures be
listed in order of importance? How could we increase the usefulness of the tabular list of a
registrant’s five most important performance measures for investors? Should there be disclosure
of the methodology behind those measures?
10. What would be the cost to registrants of any computations required to identify and rank
the five most important performance measures? If registrants do not currently rank their
performance measures, would requiring them to list their five most important performance
measures in order of importance be unduly burdensome? Would such disclosure contain
information that is sensitive or has competitive value to a registrant? Should an exemption from
any requirement to disclose the five most important performance measures be available if the
disclosure would contain such sensitive or competitive information? If so, how should we
specify the scope of any such exemption?
11. What if a registrant’s five most important performance measures include measures that
are included in the Proposed Rules or the additional measures we are considering? Should
registrants be permitted to disclose fewer than five measures if they deem fewer than five to be
important or if they consider fewer than five measures?
12. Would a tabular format help investors locate, use and understand disclosure of the five
most important performance measures? Are there practical or other considerations that would
make such tabular disclosure challenging or unduly burdensome for registrants? Would this
format impede registrants from providing meaningful disclosure about their primary performance
measures that factor into determining pay?
23
13. Should we, either in addition to or in lieu of the Proposed Rules and the disclosure of the
additional measures we are considering, revise Item 402 of Regulation S-K to explicitly require
registrants to disclose all of the performance measures that actually determine NEO
compensation? If registrants are already providing this disclosure, are there ways we could
improve this disclosure? For example, do investors find current disclosures about executive
compensation performance measures complicated or difficult to analyze? If so, how could we
make these disclosures less complicated or facilitate their analysis while also meeting the
requirements of Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act?
14. To what extent would the ability of registrants to voluntarily supplement the disclosure
required by the Proposed Rules obviate the need for additional mandated elements of disclosure
considered in this re-opening release? Should we rely on investor demand and individual
registrant circumstances to drive any additional disclosures? Would such voluntary disclosures
be more useful than the additional contemplated disclosures? Would such disclosures lack
comparability or be overly subjective relative to the additional contemplated disclosures?
15. As noted above, based on staff analysis of filings in 2019, approximately 45 percent of
registrants subject to the Proposed Rules would be SRCs, compared to approximately 40 percent
at the time of publication of the Proposed Rules.
24 In light of this, should we reconsider the
scaled requirements for SRCs in the Proposed Rules and/or the additional measures we are
considering?
16. For SRCs, would disclosure of either pre-tax net income or net income be useful to
investors when placed alongside the metrics included in the Proposing Release? Are there
different measures of financial performance that would be more appropriate for SRCs? Should
 24 See supra footnote 5.
24
we require SRCs to disclose a Company-Selected Measure and the list of their five most
important performance measures used to set NEO compensation? Why or why not? What
would be the burdens on SRCs of providing this additional disclosure and would the benefits of
requiring this disclosure for SRCs justify the burdens? Would any such burdens be mitigated by
the fact that the Company-Selected Measure and the list of a company’s five most important
performance measures are by definition measures that the company already uses to link
compensation actually paid to financial performance? Is there relevant data on the long-term
costs from diminished transparency that we should consider in this regard?
17. The Commission proposed to require that registrants use XBRL to tag separately the
values disclosed in the required table, and separately block-text tag the disclosure of the
relationship among the measures, the footnote disclosure of deductions and additions used to
determine executive compensation actually paid, and the footnote disclosure regarding vesting
date valuation assumptions. We are considering requiring registrants to also tag specific data
points (such as quantitative amounts) within the footnote disclosures that would be block-text
tagged. In addition, we are considering requiring registrants to use Inline XBRL rather than
XBRL to tag their pay versus performance disclosure.
25 Would additional detail tagging of some
or all of those specific data points within the footnote disclosures be valuable to investors? If so,
which specific data points within the footnote disclosures should we require registrants to detail
tag and why? What would be the incremental costs of such a requirement? Should we require
 25 Subsequent to the proposal, the Commission adopted rules replacing XBRL tagging requirements for registrant
financial statements with Inline XBRL tagging requirements. Inline XBRL embeds the machine-readable tags
in the human-readable document itself, rather than in a separate exhibit. See Inline XBRL Filing of Tagged
Data, Release No. 33-10514 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 40846 (Aug. 16, 2018)]. The Commission also has
subsequently adopted rules requiring structured data reporting using Inline XBRL format for certain business
development company disclosures. See Securities Offering Reform for Closed-End Investment Companies,
Release No. IC-33836 (Apr. 8, 2020) [85 FR 33290 (June 1, 2020)]. As a result of those changes, we are
considering using Inline XBRL, rather than XBRL, for the proposed tagging requirements.
25
registrants to use Inline XBRL rather than XBRL to tag the proposed new pay versus
performance disclosures? Is there an alternative machine-readable language to Inline XBRL that
we should consider? Should we enable more flexibility by accommodating other machinereadable languages? If we were to require Inline XBRL detail tagging of the disclosures, should
we exempt smaller reporting companies from that requirement?26 Would the costs be different
for smaller reporting companies to comply with such a requirement as compared to other
registrants? Should we, as was proposed with respect to the original XBRL tagging requirement,
provide a phase-in for smaller reporting companies for any Inline XBRL requirement that
includes additional detail tagging?
18. Some commenters to the Proposing Release noted that the definition of compensation
actually paid may result in some misalignment between the time period to which pay is attributed
and the time period in which the associated performance is reported, but they generally disagreed
on whether and how to revise the definition to improve such alignment.27 Is there an alternative
approach that would reduce the risk of misalignment of compensation actually paid with the
associated financial performance and still provide for appropriate comparability across
registrants, including the additional measures of financial performance discussed above? Would
 26 Smaller reporting companies are currently subject to the Commission’s Inline XBRL tagging requirements,
including detail tagging requirements.

26
the inclusion of additional measures of financial performance as contemplated above affect this
potential mismatch?
19. Some commenters to the Proposing Release noted potential challenges with using the
pension service cost as defined in FASB ASC Topic 715 to determine the amount attributable to
pension plans to be included in compensation actually paid.28 As discussed in the Proposing
Release, the service cost for services rendered by the executive in the applicable year is meant to
approximate the value that would be set aside currently by the registrant to fund the pension
benefits payable upon retirement for the service provided during the applicable year, and is
intended to provide a more meaningful comparison across registrants of the amounts “actually
paid” under both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Is there an alternative measure
of the change in pension value attributable to the applicable fiscal year that is better
representative of the “actually paid” amount of pension benefits for an executive and would
reduce the burden of computing compensation actually paid while preserving the benefits of the
measure for investors? If so, describe how that amount would be calculated and what
assumptions or new or additional data would be necessary for such calculation.
20. Some commenters to the Proposing Release noted potential challenges associated with
computing the fair value of options at the vesting date as opposed to the grant date.29 Are there
simplifications or other adjustments that we could permit for this purpose in order to mitigate
such challenges? How, if at all, would any such simplifications or adjustments affect the cost of

2015.
27
producing the disclosure and the usefulness of the disclosure? For example, are there certain
assumptions used in the valuation of options that we should allow to be carried forward from the
grant date rather than re-computed as of the vesting date? What is the likelihood that
assumptions would vary significantly between grant date and vesting date? To what extent could
any new assumptions required for a valuation as of the vesting date be determined based on
computations that would be made for another purpose, such as the valuation of new grants made
around the same time?
21. Some commenters to the Proposing Release had questions about which time periods
should be disclosed in the TSR portions of the table.
30 Should we clarify what time periods
should be disclosed? For example, should we require TSR to be a five-year cumulative and
rolling average (i.e., the TSR for the first year would be the average TSR over the five years
preceding and including the first year, the TSR for the second year would be the average TSR
over the five years preceding and including the second year, etc.)31; should we require TSR to be
a cumulative average within the five-year period in the table (i.e., the TSR for the first year
would be an average of the TSR over that first year, the TSR for the second year would be an
average of the TSR over the first year and the second year, etc.)
32; or should we require TSR to
be an annual year-over-year figure (i.e., the TSR for the first year would be the average TSR

32 See, e.g., letter from Pearl Meyer & Partners dated July 6, 2015.
28
over the first year, the TSR for the second year would be the average TSR for the second year,
etc.)33? What would the benefits and drawbacks be of each of these approaches?
22. Are there any other developments (including with respect to executive compensation
practices) since the Proposing Release that should affect our consideration of the Proposed Rules
or their potential economic effects? How have qualitative measures in executive compensation
packages changed and/or developed since the Proposing Release? How should we contemplate
such changes in our consideration of the disclosures discussed above and in the Proposing
Release? How have environmental, social and governance related metrics changed and/or
developed since the Proposing Release? How should we contemplate such changes in our
consideration of the disclosures discussed above and in the Proposing Release? Are there
changes in market practices with respect to disclosures in the CD&A or voluntary disclosures
that should affect our approach or affect our consideration of the economic effects of any rule
changes? Are there any changes we should consider in the methodologies and estimates used to
analyze the economic effects of the Proposed Rules in the Proposing Release?
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding the
Proposed Rules, specific issues discussed in this release or the Proposing Release, and other
matters that may have an effect on the Proposed Rules or the additional disclosure requirements
we have noted here that we are considering. We request comment from the point of view of
registrants, shareholders, directors, executives, investors, other market participants, and anyone
else with an interest in this issue. If alternatives to the Proposed Rules are suggested, supporting
data and analysis and quantitative information as to the costs and benefits of those alternatives
are of particular assistance. Commenters are urged to be as specific as possible; when

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Adviser and Fund Cybersecurity Risks
Advisers and funds play an important role in our financial markets and increasingly
depend on technology for critical business operations.2
 Advisers and funds are exposed to, and
rely on, a broad array of interconnected systems and networks, both directly and through service
providers such as custodians, brokers, dealers, pricing services, and other technology vendors.
Advisers also increasingly use digital engagement tools and other technology to engage with
clients and develop and provide investment advice.
3
 As a result, they face numerous
cybersecurity risks and may experience cybersecurity incidents that can cause, or be exacerbated
by, critical system or process failures.4
At the same time, cyber threat actors have grown more sophisticated and may target
advisers and funds, putting them at risk of suffering significant financial, operational, legal, and
 2
 Unless otherwise noted, the term “fund” means a registered investment company or a closed-end company
that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act
(“BDC”).

reputational harm.
5
 Cybersecurity incidents affecting advisers and funds also can cause
substantial harm to their clients and investors. For example, cybersecurity incidents caused by
malicious software (also known as malware) can cause the loss of adviser, fund, or client data.
Cybersecurity incidents can prevent an adviser or fund from executing its investment strategy or
an adviser, fund, client, or investor from accessing an account, which can lead to financial losses
for clients or investors. In addition, cybersecurity incidents can lead to the theft of intellectual
property, confidential or proprietary information, or client assets.
An adviser or a fund may incur substantial remediation costs due to a cybersecurity
incident.
6
 It may need to reimburse clients for cybersecurity-related losses as well as implement
expensive organizational or technological changes to reinforce its ability to respond to and
recover from a cybersecurity incident. It may also see an increase in its insurance premiums. In
addition, an adviser or fund may face increased litigation, regulatory, or other legal and financial
risks or suffer reputational damage, and any of these outcomes could cause its clients or investors
to lose confidence in their adviser or fund, or the financial markets more generally.
Cybersecurity risk management is therefore a critical area of focus for advisers and funds, and
many advisers and funds have taken steps to address cybersecurity risks.

data breach in the financial industry in the United States is $5.72 million); FBI 2020 Internet Crime Report,
supra footnote 5, at 15 (noting that cybercrime victims lost approximately $4.2 billion in 2020).
The Commission and its staff have and continue to focus on cybersecurity risks to
advisers and their clients, and funds and their investors.
7
 We are concerned about the efficacy of
adviser and fund practices industry-wide to address cybersecurity risks and incidents, and that
less robust practices may not address investor protection concerns. We are also concerned about
the effectiveness of disclosures to advisory clients and fund shareholders concerning
cybersecurity risks and incidents. The staff has observed a number of practices with respect to
firms addressing cybersecurity risk and has provided its observations on a number of occasions
to assist firms in enhancing their cybersecurity preparedness.8
 Despite these efforts and in the
face of ever-increasing cybersecurity risk, staff continues to observe that certain advisers and
funds show a lack of cybersecurity preparedness, which puts clients and investors at risk. We
believe that clients and investors would be better protected if advisers and funds were required to
have policies and procedures that include specific elements to address cybersecurity risks.
Moreover, the staff has observed that while many advisers and funds already provide
disclosure about cybersecurity risks, we are concerned that clients and investors may not be
receiving sufficient cybersecurity-related information, particularly with respect to cybersecurity
incidents, to assess the operational risk at a firm or the effects of an incident to help ensure they
are making informed investment decisions. We therefore seek to improve cybersecurity-related
disclosures by addressing cybersecurity more directly.
Finally, we believe that, in the face of ever-increasing cybersecurity risk, advisers and
funds should report certain cybersecurity incidents to the Commission to assist in its oversight

role. As further discussed below, this would allow the Commission and its staff to understand
better the nature and extent of cybersecurity incidents occurring at advisers and funds, how firms
respond to such incidents to protect clients and investors, and how cybersecurity incidents affect
the financial markets more generally. We believe requiring advisers and funds to report the
occurrence of significant cybersecurity incidents would bolster the efficiency and effectiveness
of our efforts to protect investors, other market participants, and the financial markets in
connection with cybersecurity incidents. Accordingly, we are proposing a set of comprehensive
reforms to address cybersecurity risks for advisers and funds, enhance disclosure of information
regarding cybersecurity risks and significant cybersecurity incidents, and require the reporting of
significant cybersecurity incidents to the Commission.
B. Current Legal and Regulatory Framework
As fiduciaries, advisers are required to act in the best interest of their clients at all times.9

Advisers owe their clients a duty of care and a duty of loyalty. An adviser’s fiduciary obligation
to its clients includes the obligation to take steps to protect client interests from being placed at
risk because of the adviser’s inability to provide advisory services.10 These include steps to
minimize operational and other risks that could lead to significant business disruptions or a loss
or misuse of client information. Under this framework, advisers today consider a number of
rules and regulations, which indirectly address cybersecurity. As discussed above, cybersecurity
incidents can lead to significant business disruptions, including lapses in communication or the
inability to place trades. In addition, these disruptions can lead to the loss of access to accounts
or investments, potentially resulting in the loss or theft of data or assets. Thus, advisers should
take steps to minimize cybersecurity risks in accordance with their fiduciary obligations.

Interpretation Regarding Standard of Conduct for Investment Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release
No. 5248 (June 5, 2019) [84 FR 33669 (July 12, 2019)], at 6-8.

(noting this fiduciary obligation in the context of business continuity plans).
Additionally, 17 CFR 275.206(4)-7 (“Advisers Act compliance rule”) requires advisers to
consider their fiduciary and regulatory obligations and formalize policies and procedures
reasonably designed to address them.11 While the Advisers Act compliance rule does not
enumerate specific elements that an adviser must include in its compliance program, an adviser
generally should first identify conflicts of interest and other compliance factors creating risk
exposure for the firm and its clients in light of the firm’s particular operations and then design
policies and procedures that address those risks.12 Because cybersecurity incidents could create
significant operational disruptions and losses to clients and investors, we understand that
advisers often consider the cybersecurity risks created by their particular circumstances when
developing their compliance policies and procedures under the Advisers Act compliance rule and
tailor their policies and procedures to address those risks.
Similarly, 17 CFR 270.38a-1 (“Investment Company compliance rule”) requires funds to
adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations
of the Federal securities laws by the fund, including policies and procedures that provide for the
oversight of compliance by each investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, and
transfer agent of the fund (“named service providers”).13 We understand that funds take into
account the specific risks they face, often including any specific cybersecurity risks, when
 11 The Advisers Act compliance rule requires an adviser that is registered, or required to be registered, with
the Commission to: (1) adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent violations of the Advisers Act by the adviser and its supervised persons; (2) designate a chief
compliance officer (“CCO”) responsible for administering the policies and procedures; and (3) review the
adequacy of the policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation at least annually.
12 See Compliance Program Release, supra footnote 10, at n.22 and accompanying text. The Commission
included business continuity, safeguards for the privacy of client records and information, as well as the
accuracy of disclosures made to investors, clients and regulators in a list of general areas it believes, at a
minimum, an adviser’s compliance program should address to the extent they are relevant to the adviser.

13 The Investment Company compliance rule also requires the fund to: (1) designate a CCO responsible for
administering the policies and procedures, subject to certain requirements, including providing the fund’s
board with an annual report; and (2) review the adequacy of the policies and procedures and the
effectiveness of their implementation at least annually.
developing their compliance policies and procedures under the Investment Company compliance
rule.
Other Commission rules require advisers and funds to consider cybersecurity. For
example, advisers and funds subject to 17 CFR 248.1 through 248.31 (“Regulation S-P”) are
required to, among other things, adopt written policies and procedures that address
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of customer records and
information.
14 These written policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to protect the
security and confidentiality of customer records and information. They must also be reasonably
designed to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards, unauthorized access to, or use of
customer records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any
customer.15
Moreover, advisers and funds subject to 17 CFR 248.201 through 202 (“Regulation SID”) must develop and implement a written identity theft program.16 A Regulation S-ID
program must include reasonable policies and procedures to identify and detect relevant red
flags, as well as respond appropriately to red flags so as to prevent and mitigate identity theft.
Regulation S-ID programs must also be reviewed periodically to ensure that changes in the
identity theft risk landscape are reflected and provide for the continued administration of the
program, including staff training and appropriate and effective oversight of service providers.

17 See also Appendix A to Subpart C of 17 CFR Part 248 (setting out Commission guidelines for
consideration when implementing an identity theft program).
In addition, because fraudulent activity could result from cybersecurity or data breaches from
insiders, such as advisory or fund personnel, advisers and funds often take precautions
concerning information security specifically related to insiders.18
C. Overview of Rule Proposal
While some funds and advisers have implemented cybersecurity programs under the
existing regulatory framework, there are no Commission rules that specifically require firms to
adopt and implement comprehensive cybersecurity programs. Based on our staff’s examinations
of advisers and funds, we are concerned that some funds and advisers that are registered with us
have not implemented reasonably designed cybersecurity programs. As a result, these firms’
clients and investors may be at greater risk of harm than those of funds and advisers that have in
place appropriate plans to address cybersecurity risks.
To address these concerns, we are proposing rules 206(4)-9 under the Advisers Act and
38a-2 under the Investment Company Act, which would require advisers and funds that are
registered or required to be registered with us to implement cybersecurity policies and
procedures addressing a number of elements.
19 Under the proposed rules, such an adviser’s or
fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures generally should be tailored based on its business
operations, including its complexity, and attendant cybersecurity risks. Further, the proposed
rules would require advisers and funds, at least annually, to review and evaluate the design and
effectiveness of their cybersecurity policies and procedures, which would allow them to update
them in the face of ever-changing cyber threats and technologies. We believe that advisers and
funds should be required to adopt and implement policies and procedures that address a number
 18 See, e.g., 17 CFR 270.17j-1; 17 CFR 275.204A-1; see also generally Personal Investment Activities of
Investment Company Personnel, Investment Company Act Release No. 23958 (Aug. 24, 1999) [64 FR
46821 (Aug. 27, 1999)] (stating that rule 17j-1 prohibits fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts by fund
personnel in connection with their personal transactions in securities held or to be acquired by the fund);
Investment Adviser Codes of Ethics, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2256 (July 2, 2004) [69 FR
41696 (July 9, 2004)] (stating that rule 204A-1 will benefit advisers by renewing their attention to their
fiduciary and other legal obligations, and by increasing their vigilance against inappropriate behavior by
employees).
19 When discussing the requirements proposed in this release, our use of the terms funds and advisers refers to
funds and advisers that are registered or required to be registered with the Commission.
of elements to increase the likelihood that they are prepared to face a cybersecurity incident
(whether that threat comes from an outside actor or the firm’s personnel), and that investors and
other market participants are protected from a cybersecurity incident that could significantly
affect a firm’s operations and lead to significant harm to clients and investors.
To address cybersecurity more directly, we also are proposing amendments to adviser
and fund disclosure requirements to provide current and prospective advisory clients and fund
shareholders with improved information regarding cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity
incidents. In particular, we propose amendments to Form ADV for advisers and Forms N-1A,
N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6 for funds. We believe these proposed cybersecurity
disclosure requirements would enhance investor protection by requiring that cybersecurity risk or
incident-related information is available to increase understanding in these areas and help ensure
that investors and clients can make informed investment decisions.
In addition, we are proposing to require advisers to report significant cybersecurity
incidents affecting the adviser, or its fund or private fund clients, to the Commission on a
confidential basis.
20 These reports would bolster the efficiency and effectiveness of our efforts
to protect investors in connection with cybersecurity incidents. This reporting would not only
help the Commission monitor and evaluate the effects of a cybersecurity incident on an adviser
and its clients or a fund and its investors, but also assess the potential systemic risks affecting
financial markets more broadly.
Taken together, these reforms are designed to promote a more comprehensive framework
to address cybersecurity risks for advisers and funds, thereby reducing the risk that advisers and
funds would be not be able to maintain critical operational capability when confronted with a
significant cybersecurity incident. These reforms also are designed to give clients and investors
better information with which to make investment decisions, and to give the Commission better

as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that
Act”).
information with which to conduct comprehensive monitoring and oversight of ever-evolving
cybersecurity risks and incidents affecting advisers and funds.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Cybersecurity Risk Management Policies and Procedures
The Commission is proposing rule 206(4)-9 under the Advisers Act and 38a-2 under the
Investment Company Act (collectively, “proposed cybersecurity risk management rules”).
21 The
proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require all advisers and funds to adopt and
implement cybersecurity policies and procedures containing certain elements. Advisers and
funds of every type and size rely on technology systems and networks and face increasing
cybersecurity risks. The rules would therefore require all of these advisers and funds to consider
and mitigate cybersecurity risk.22
As discussed below, while the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would
require all such advisers and funds to implement cybersecurity hygiene and protection measures,
we recognize that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing cybersecurity risks. As a
result, the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would allow firms to tailor their
cybersecurity policies and procedures to fit the nature and scope of their business and address
their individual cybersecurity risks.
We request comment on the entities subject to the proposed rules:
1. Should we exempt certain types of advisers or funds from these proposed
cybersecurity risk management rules? If so, which ones, and why? For example, is
 21 Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to define, and prescribe means reasonably
designed to prevent, such acts, practices and courses of business conduct as are fraudulent, deceptive or
manipulative under the Advisers Act, and to adopt rules reasonably designed to prevent fraud. We are
proposing rule 206(4)-9 as a means reasonably designed to prevent fraud. Section 38(a) of the Investment
Company Act authorizes the Commission to “make ... such rules and regulations ... as are necessary or
appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Commission elsewhere in [the Investment
Company Act].”
22 Proposed rule 206(4)-9 would apply to advisers to separately managed accounts and pooled investment
vehicles, both private and offered to the public. Proposed rule 38a-2 would apply to mutual funds,
exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), unit investment trusts, registered closed-end funds, and BDCs.
there a subset of funds or advisers with operations so limited or staffs so small that
the adoption of cybersecurity risk management programs is not beneficial?
2. Should we scale the proposed requirements based on the size of the adviser or fund?
If so, which of the elements described below should not be required for smaller
advisers or funds? How would we define such smaller advisers or funds? For
example, should we define such advisers and funds based on the thresholds that the
Commission uses for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act? Would using
different thresholds based on assets under management, such as $150 million or $200
million, be appropriate? Would another threshold be more suitable, such as one
based on an adviser’s or fund’s limited operations, staffing, revenues or management?
1. Required Elements of Advisers’ and Funds’ Policies and Procedures
The proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require advisers and funds to
adopt and implement written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to address
cybersecurity risks. We believe that these policies and procedures would help address
operational and other risks that could harm advisory clients and fund investors or lead to the
unauthorized access to or use of adviser or fund information.
23 The proposed cybersecurity risk
management rules enumerate certain general elements that advisers and funds would be required
to address in their cybersecurity policies and procedures.
24 They also contain a number of
 23 After gaining access to an adviser’s or a fund’s information systems, an attacker could use this access to
steal, disclose, delete, destroy, or modify adviser or fund information, as well as steal client or investor
assets.
24 Funds and advisers may wish to consult a number of resources in connection with these elements. See, e.g.,
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity, Version 1.1 (Apr. 16, 2018), available at
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf (“NIST Framework”); Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Cyber Essentials Starter Kit – The Basics for Building a

08_0.pdf.
defined terms that apply across the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules as well as the
other rule and form amendments we are proposing.
25
The general elements are designed to enumerate core areas that firms must address when
adopting, implementing, reassessing and updating their cybersecurity policies and procedures.
We recognize, however, that given the number and varying characteristics (e.g., size, business,
and sophistication) of advisers and funds, firms need the ability to tailor their cybersecurity
policies and procedures based on their individual facts and circumstances. The proposed
cybersecurity risk management rules therefore give advisers and funds the flexibility to address
the general elements based on the particular cybersecurity risks posed by each adviser’s or fund’s
operations and business practices. In addition, because cybersecurity threats are constantly
evolving and measures to address those threats continue to advance, this approach would allow
an adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures to evolve accordingly as firms
reassess their cybersecurity risks in accordance with the proposed cybersecurity risk
management rules.
The proposed cybersecurity risk management rules also would provide flexibility for the
adviser and fund to determine the person or group of people who implement and oversee the
effectiveness of its cybersecurity policies and procedures. Wide-ranging areas of expertise could
be needed to manage cybersecurity risk. We understand that cybersecurity may be the
responsibility of many individuals within an organization, and expertise may be provided both
 25 The proposed defined terms for advisers and funds are the same in most instances, except where necessary
to take into account relevant differences in each of the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules. For
example, the majority of differences between proposed rules 206(4)-9 and 38a-2 are that the rule applicable
to advisers includes the word “adviser” in a number of terms (e.g., “adviser information systems” and
“adviser information”) whereas the rule applicable to funds includes the word “fund” (e.g., “fund
information systems” and “fund information.”) in a number of terms. We understand that there are
different definitions for a number of common terms in the realm of cybersecurity, and we propose terms
derived from a number established sources. See Presidential Policy Directive -- United States Cyber
Incident Coordination (July 26, 2016) (“PPD-41”); 6 U.S.C. 1501 (2021); 44 U.S.C. 3502 (2021); 44

Glossary”). We believe the proposed terms are sufficiently precise and aligned with each other for advisers
and funds to understand and utilize in connection with the proposed rules. Using common terms and
similar definitions is intended to facilitate compliance and reduce regulatory burdens.
internally and by third-party experts. Within an adviser or fund organization, various officers or
employees may be involved in implementing a cybersecurity program, including those who
specialize in technology, risk, compliance, and legal matters. Some advisers and funds may be a
part of a larger company structure that shares common cybersecurity and information technology
(“IT”) personnel, resources, systems, and infrastructure. Advisers and funds may also utilize
third-party cybersecurity experts that provide varying perspectives and are well-positioned to
understand and assist in managing risks. Multiple perspectives may assist in building a stronger
cybersecurity program, and also would allow firms to add expertise as needed in the rapidly
changing cybersecurity environment. We believe that this approach allows advisers and funds of
differing sizes, organizational structures, and investment strategies to tailor their cybersecurity
programs effectively to their operations.
Under the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules, an adviser or fund may choose
to administer its cybersecurity policies and procedures using in-house resources with appropriate
knowledge and expertise. The proposed framework also does not preclude an adviser or fund
from using a third party’s cybersecurity risk management services, subject to appropriate
oversight. Similarly, subject to appropriate oversight, a fund’s adviser or sub-adviser could
administer any of the functions of the fund’s required policies and procedures.
26 Whether the
administrators of an adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures are in-house or a
third party, reasonably designed policies and procedures must empower these administrators to
make decisions and escalate issues to senior officers as necessary for the administrator to carry
out the role effectively (e.g., the policies and procedures could include an explicit escalation
provision to the adviser’s or fund’s senior officers). Reasonably designed cybersecurity policies
and procedures generally should specify which groups, positions, or individuals, whether inhouse or third-party, are responsible for implementing and administering the policies and

obligations under the proposed risk management rules. Delegating any or all cybersecurity-related
activities does not exempt an adviser or fund from its oversight responsibilities.
procedures, including specifying those responsible for communicating incidents internally and
making decisions with respect to reporting to the Commission and disclosing to clients and
investors certain incidents.
We believe that this approach would help ensure that advisers and funds adopt and
implement cybersecurity policies and procedures that are effective in mitigating cybersecurity
risk without being overly burdensome or costly to implement. Moreover, we believe the
proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would benefit advisory clients and fund investors
because advisers and funds would be better prepared to confront a cybersecurity incident if (and
when) it occurs.
27 The proposed rules also would help to ensure that advisers and funds focus
their efforts and resources on mitigating the cybersecurity risks associated with their operations
and business practices.28
a. Risk Assessment
The first step in designing effective cybersecurity policies and procedures is assessing
and understanding the cybersecurity risks facing an adviser or a fund.
29 As an element of an
adviser’s or fund’s reasonable policies and procedures, the proposed cybersecurity risk
management rules would require advisers and funds periodically to assess, categorize, prioritize,
and draft written documentation of, the cybersecurity risks associated with their information
 27 We propose to define “cybersecurity incident” as “an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through [an
adviser’s or a fund’s] information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
[an adviser’s or a fund’s] information systems or any [adviser or fund] information residing therein.” See
proposed rules 206(4)-9 and 38a-2. This proposed term is derived from the 44 U.S.C. 3552, which is
incorporated into PPD-41 (defining “cyber incident”), and included in the NIST Glossary (defining
“incident”). We believe this term is sufficiently understood and broad enough to encompass incidents that
could adversely affect an adviser’s or fund’s information systems or information residing therein, such as
gaining access without authorization or by exceeding authorized access to such systems and information
that could lead, for example, to the modification or destruction of systems and information.
28 We propose to define “cybersecurity risk” as the “financial, operational, legal, reputational, and other
adverse consequences that could stem from cybersecurity incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities.” See
proposed rules 206(4)-9 and 38a-2. This proposed term is designed to capture risks that an adviser or fund
faces when confronted with incidents, threats and vulnerabilities, and we believe is generally well
understood in connection with integrating cybersecurity into enterprise risk management. See generally
NIST Framework, supra footnote 24.
29 Risk assessments are included as an element in many cybersecurity frameworks. See, e.g., NIST
Framework, supra footnote 24.
systems and the information residing therein.30 The proposed cybersecurity risk management
rules would require advisers and funds, when conducting this risk assessment, to:
(i) Categorize and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on an inventory of the
components of their information systems, the information residing therein, and the
potential effect of a cybersecurity incident on the advisers and funds; and
(ii) Identify their service providers that receive, maintain or process adviser or fund
information, or that are permitted to access their information systems, including
the information residing therein, and identify the cybersecurity risks associated
with the use of these service providers.31
The proposed rules would also require written documentation of any risk assessment. Generally,
this risk assessment should inform senior officers at the adviser or the fund of the risks specific
to the firm and support responses to cybersecurity risks by identifying cybersecurity threats to
information systems that, if compromised, could result in significant cybersecurity incidents.
32
 30 See proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(1) and 38a-2(a)(1). “Adviser information systems” is proposed to be
defined as “information resources owned or used by the adviser, including physical or virtual infrastructure
controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of adviser information to maintain or support the
adviser’s operations.” See proposed rule 206(4)-9; see also proposed rule 38a-2 (defining “fund
information systems”). The definitions of these terms are designed to be broad enough to encompass all
the electronic information resources owned or used by an adviser or a fund.
31 “Adviser information” is proposed to be defined as “any electronic information related to the adviser’s
business, including personal information, received, maintained, created, or processed by the adviser.” The
term “personal information” is proposed to be defined as: “(1) any information that can be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify an individual, such as name, date of birth, place of birth,
telephone number, street address, mother’s maiden name, Social Security number, driver’s license number,
electronic mail address, account number, account password, biometric records or other non-public
authentication information; or (2) Any other non-public information regarding a client’s account.” See
proposed rule 206(4)-9; see also proposed rule 38a-2 (the term “personal information” in proposed rule
38a-2 does not include the second prong of the same term contained in proposed rule 206(4)-9). The
definitions of “personal information” for advisers and funds are derived from a number of established
sources and aim to capture a broad array of personal information that can reside on an adviser’s or a fund’s
information systems. See e.g., Regulation S-ID, supra footnote 16 (defining “identifying information”);
NIST Glossary, supra footnote 24 (defining “personal information” and “personally identifiable
information”).
32 “Cybersecurity threat” is proposed to be defined as “any potential occurrence that may result in an
unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of [an adviser’s or a
fund’s] information systems or any [adviser or fund] information residing therein.” See proposed rules
206(4)-9 and 38a-2.
In general, an adviser or fund’s cybersecurity program should be reasonably designed to ensure
its operational capability, including resiliency and capacity of information systems, when
confronted with a cybersecurity incident, whether at the adviser or at a service provider that may
access adviser or fund information.
An adviser or fund generally should assess, categorize, and prioritize the cybersecurity
risks created by its information systems and information residing therein in light of the firm’s
particular operations.33 For example, advisers may be subject to different risks as a result of
international operations, insider threats, or remote or traveling employees. Only after assessing,
analyzing, categorizing, and prioritizing its risks can an adviser or fund develop and implement
cybersecurity policies and procedures designed to mitigate those risks. The proposed
cybersecurity risk management rules would also require advisers and funds to reassess and reprioritize their cybersecurity risks periodically as changes that affect these risks occur. Due to
the ongoing and emerging nature of cybersecurity threats, and the proposed requirement
discussed below that advisers and funds review their cybersecurity policies and procedures no
less frequently than annually, we are not proposing that such a reassessment occur at specified
intervals.34 Instead, advisers and funds should reassess their cybersecurity risks as they arise to
reflect internal changes, such as changes to its business, online presence, or client web access, or
external changes, such as changes in the evolving technology and cybersecurity threat landscape,
and inform senior officers of the adviser or fund of any material changes to the risk assessment.
In assessing ongoing and emerging cybersecurity threats, advisers and funds generally should
monitor and consider updates and guidance from private sector and governmental resources,
 33 Some firms use an enterprise governance, risk management and compliance (“EGRC”) system to manage
cybersecurity risk and compliance by creating policies, procedures, and internal controls that assist in
identifying cybersecurity risks related to particular systems.
34 See discussion in section II.A.2 below (advisers and funds must review their cybersecurity policies and
procedures no less frequently than annually, including preparing and reviewing a written report that is
designed to address cybersecurity risk assessments, among other items).
such as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“FS-ISAC”) and the
Department of Homeland Security’s CISA.35
Because many advisers and funds are exposed to cybersecurity risks through the
technology of their service providers, a risk assessment also must identify service providers that
receive, maintain, or process adviser or fund information, or that are permitted to access their
information systems, including the information residing therein and the cybersecurity risks they
present.36 For example, advisers may use service providers who provide trade order
management systems that allow the adviser to automate all or some of the adviser’s trading, and
advisers should consider any cybersecurity risks presented by these services. In identifying
cybersecurity risks, an adviser or fund should consider the service provider’s cybersecurity
practices, including whether any systems used have the resiliency and capacity to process
transactions in an accurate, timely and efficient manner, and their capability to protect
information and systems (including response and recovery procedures in response to any
incidents and any escalation protocols contained therein).
Generally, an adviser or fund should take into account whether a cybersecurity incident at
a service provider could lead to the unauthorized access or use of adviser or fund information or
technology or process failures. For an adviser, such unauthorized access or use or failure could
disrupt portfolio management, trade execution, or other aspects of its operations. For example,
an adviser may retain a cloud service provider for maintaining required books and records. If all
of the adviser’s books and records were concentrated at this cloud service provider and a
cybersecurity incident were to occur at the cloud service provider—or any service provider
maintaining the adviser’s books and records—there could potentially be detrimental data loss
affecting the ability of the adviser to provide services and comply with regulatory obligations.
 35 Information about FS-ISAC is available at https://www.fsisac.com. Information about CISA is available at
https://www.cisa.gov.
36 Oversight of third-party service provider or vendor risk is a component of many cybersecurity frameworks.
See, e.g., NIST Framework, supra footnote 24 (discussing supply chain risks associated with products and
services an organization uses).
Accordingly, as part of identifying the cybersecurity risks associated with using this cloud
service provider, the adviser should consider how the service provider will secure and maintain
data and whether the service provider has response and recovery procedures in place such that
any compromised or lost data in the event of a cybersecurity incident can be recovered and
restored.
For a fund, similar unauthorized access or use or failure could affect the valuation of
portfolio securities or the processing of shareholder transactions, which could significantly
disrupt the fund’s operations. For example, a fund may rely on service providers to calculate the
fund’s net asset value (“NAV”). The inability of an administrator, pricing vendor, or accounting
system to calculate a fund’s NAV due to a cybersecurity incident would force a fund to consider
alternatives. As part of its cybersecurity program and its oversight of service providers, a fund
that relies on any service provider for calculating NAV generally should assess the potential
cybersecurity risks presented by that service provider and develop procedures to respond to and
mitigate disruptions, including by identifying alternative processes or vendors to calculate the
fund’s NAV.37 Accordingly, the fund’s risk assessment generally should involve inquiring about
that service provider’s business continuity and disaster recovery protocols with respect to a
cybersecurity incident.
b. User Security and Access
As an element of an adviser’s or fund’s reasonably designed policies and procedures, the
proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require controls designed to minimize
 37 See generally Good Faith Determinations of Fair Value, Investment Company Release No. 34128 (Dec. 3,
2020) [86 FR 748 (Jan. 06, 2021)], at text accompanying nn.94-95 (determining fair value in good faith
requires the oversight and evaluation of any pricing services used, including approval, monitoring, and
evaluation).
user-related risks and prevent the unauthorized access to information and systems.
38 Their
policies and procedures must include:
(1) Requiring standards of behavior for individuals authorized to access adviser or fund
information systems and any adviser or fund information residing therein, such as an
acceptable use policy;
(2) Identifying and authenticating individual users, including implementing
authentication measures that require users to present a combination of two or more
credentials for access verification;
(3) Establishing procedures for the timely distribution, replacement, and revocation of
passwords or methods of authentication;
(4) Restricting access to specific adviser or fund information systems or components
thereof and adviser or fund information residing therein solely to individuals
requiring access to such systems and information as is necessary for them to perform
their responsibilities and functions on behalf of the adviser or fund; and
(5) Securing remote access technologies used to interface with adviser or fund
information systems.
The proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require advisers and funds, as
part of their cybersecurity programs, to address user access controls to restrict system and data
access to authorized users.39 Such controls are necessary to prevent and detect unauthorized
access to systems or client or investor data or information. In addition, as remote access and
teleworking have become increasingly common, we believe that having such measures is a
necessary component of robust and comprehensive cybersecurity policies and procedures.
 38 See proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(2) and 38a-2(a)(2).
39 Advisers and funds generally should consider their potential obligations under Regulation S-P and
Regulation S-ID to implement certain access controls with respect to protecting client or investor
information.
In designing and implementing user access controls, advisers and funds generally should
develop a clear understanding of the need for access to systems, data, functions, and/or accounts,
including identifying which users have legitimate needs to access particularly critical or sensitive
systems, data, functions, or accounts. For example, a portfolio manager may have privileged
access to trading systems that permit him or her to enter trades, while a compliance personnel’s
access may be limited to reviewing or approving, but not entering, trades.
Access to systems and data can be controlled through a variety of means, including, but
not limited to, the issuance of user credentials, digital rights management with respect to
proprietary hardware and copyrighted software, authentication and authorization methods (e.g.,
multi-factor authentication and geolocation), and tiered access to sensitive information and
network resources. Effective controls would also generally include user security and access
measures that are regularly monitored not only to provide access to authorized users, but also to
remove access for users that are no longer authorized, whether due to removal from a project or
termination of employment.
As part of its user access controls, an adviser or fund should also consider what measures
are necessary for clients and investors that have access to information systems and information
residing on the systems—not only user access controls for its own personnel. For example, an
adviser or fund may implement measures that monitor for unauthorized login attempts and
account lockouts, and the handling of customer requests, including for user name and password
changes. Similarly, well-designed user access controls should assess the need to authenticate or
investigate any unusual customer requests (e.g., wire transfer or withdraw requests).
In developing these policies and procedures, an adviser or fund also should take into
account the types of technology through which its users access adviser or fund information
systems. For example, mobile devices (whether firm-issued or personal devices) that allow
employees to access sensitive data and systems may create additional and unique vulnerabilities,
including when such devices are used internationally. An adviser or fund may consider limiting
mobile or other devices approved for remote access to those issued by the firm or enrolled
through a mobile device manager.
40
In addition, an adviser or fund should consider its practices with respect to securing
remote network access and teleworking to define its network perimeter. Advisers and funds
generally should implement detection security capabilities that can identify threats on a
network’s endpoints. For example, they may utilize software that monitors and inspects all files
on an endpoint, such as a mobile phone or remote laptop, and identifies and blocks incoming
unauthorized communications. Advisers and funds should also consider cybersecurity best
practices in remote or telework locations. For example, if adviser or fund personnel work
remotely at home or in a co-working space, additional cybersecurity risks, such as unsecured or
less secure Wi-Fi, may be present, resulting in sensitive information being seen, gathered or
stolen by unauthorized persons. Accordingly, firms should consider having policies and
procedures for using any mobile or other devices approved for remote access, and implementing
security measures and training on device policies and effective security practices.
c. Information Protection
As an element of an adviser’s or fund’s reasonably designed policies and procedures, the
proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require advisers and funds to monitor
information systems and protect information from unauthorized access or use, based on a
periodic assessment of their information systems and the information that resides on the
systems.41 Such assessment should take into account:
(1) The sensitivity level and importance of adviser or fund information to its business
operations;
(2) Whether any adviser or fund information is personal information;
 40 Advisers and funds may wish to consider multi-factor authentication methods that are not based solely on
SMS-delivery (e.g., text message delivery) of authentication codes, because such methods may provide less
security than other non-SMS based multi-factor authentication methods.
41 Proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(3) and 38a-2(a)(3).
(3) Where and how adviser or fund information is accessed, stored and transmitted,
including the monitoring of adviser or fund information in transmission;
(4) Adviser or fund information systems access controls and malware protection; and
(5) The potential effect of a cybersecurity incident involving adviser or fund information
on the adviser or fund and its clients or shareholders, including the ability for the
adviser to continue to provide investment advice or the fund to continue providing
services.
Advisers and funds generally should use the information obtained from this assessment to
determine what methods to implement to prevent the unauthorized access or use of such data.
For example, an adviser or fund could utilize processes such as encryption, network
segmentation, and access controls to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive
data or information or critical systems.
An adviser or fund could also implement measures reasonably designed to identify
suspicious behavior that include consistent monitoring of systems and personnel, such as the
generation and review of activity logs, identification of potential anomalous activity, and
escalation of issues to senior officers, as appropriate. Such a program may include rules to
identify and block the transmission of sensitive data (e.g., account numbers, Social Security
numbers, trade information, and source code) from leaving the organization. The program could
also include testing of systems, including penetration tests. An adviser or fund could also
consider measures to track the actions taken in response to findings from testing and monitoring,
material changes to business operations or technology, or any other significant events.
Appropriate methods for preventing the unauthorized use of data may differ depending on
circumstances specific to an adviser or fund, such as the systems used, the relationship with
service providers, or level of access granted to employees or contractors. Appropriate methods
would also generally be expected to evolve with changes in technology and the increased
sophistication of cybersecurity attacks.
In addition, as part of an adviser’s or fund’s reasonably designed cybersecurity policies
and procedures, an adviser or fund would be required to oversee any service providers that
receive, maintain, or process adviser or fund information, or are otherwise permitted to access
their information systems and any information residing therein. Advisers and funds would be
required to document that the adviser or fund is requiring such service providers, pursuant to a
written contract, to implement and maintain appropriate measures, including measures similar to
the elements advisers and fund must address in their own cybersecurity policies and procedures,
designed to protect adviser and fund information and systems. Such policies and procedures
generally should also include other oversight measures, such as due diligence procedures or
periodic contract review processes, that allow funds and advisers to assess whether, and help to
ensure that, their agreements with service providers contain provisions that require service
providers to implement and maintain appropriate measures designed to protect fund and adviser
information and systems (e.g., notifying the adviser or fund of cybersecurity incidents that
adversely affect an adviser’s or fund’s information, systems, or operations). Given the
significant role played by service providers, we believe this proposed requirement would assist
advisers and funds, when considering whether to hire or retain service providers, in assessing
whether they are capable of appropriately protecting important information and systems.
d. Threat and Vulnerability Management
As an element of an adviser’s or fund’s reasonably designed policies and procedures, the
proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require advisers and funds to detect,
mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities with respect to adviser or fund
information and systems.
42 Cybersecurity threats may result in unauthorized access to an
adviser’s or fund’s information systems or any information residing therein that could lead to
 42 Proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(4) and 38a-2(a)(4). See proposed definition of “cybersecurity threat,” supra
footnote 32. “Cybersecurity vulnerability” is proposed to be defined as “a vulnerability in [an adviser’s or
a fund’s] information systems, information system security procedures, or internal controls, including
vulnerabilities in their design, maintenance, or implementation that, if exploited, could result in a
cybersecurity incident.”
adverse consequences. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities present weaknesses in adviser or fund
information systems that attackers may exploit. Because advisers and funds depend on
information systems to process, store, and transmit sensitive information and to conduct business
functions, it is essential for advisers and funds to manage cybersecurity threats and
vulnerabilities effectively.
Detecting, mitigating, and remediating threats and vulnerabilities is essential to
preventing cyber incidents before they occur. Advisers and funds generally should seek to detect
cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities through ongoing monitoring (e.g., comprehensive
examinations and risk management processes). Ongoing monitoring of vulnerabilities could
include, for example, conducting network, system, and application vulnerability assessments.
This could include scans or reviews of internal systems, externally-facing systems, new systems,
and systems used by service providers. Advisers and funds generally should also monitor
industry and government sources for new threat and vulnerability information that may assist
them in detecting cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.43
In general, once a threat or vulnerability is identified, advisers and funds should consider
how to mitigate and remediate the threat or vulnerability, with a view towards minimizing the
window of opportunity for attackers to exploit vulnerable hardware and software. Methods for
mitigating and remediating threats and vulnerabilities could include, for example, implementing
a patch management program to ensure timely patching of hardware and software vulnerabilities
and maintaining a process to track and address reports of vulnerabilities.44 An adviser or a fund
should adopt policies and procedures that establish accountability for handling vulnerability
reports, and processes for intake, assignment, escalation, remediation, and remediation testing.
 43 See supra footnote 35 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., CISA, National Cyber Awareness System –
Alerts, available at https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts (last visited Feb. 2, 2022) (providing information
about current security issues, vulnerabilities, and exploits).
44 Advisers and funds should also consider the vulnerabilities associated with “end of life systems” (i.e.,
systems in which software is no longer supported by the particular vendor and for which security patches
are no longer issued).
For example, an adviser or fund may use a vulnerability tracking system that includes severity
ratings, and metrics for measuring timing for identification, analysis, and remediation of
vulnerabilities.
Advisers and funds should also consider role-specific cybersecurity threat and
vulnerability and response training. For example, training could include secure system
administration courses for IT professionals, vulnerability awareness and prevention training for
web application developers, and social engineering awareness training for employees and
executives. Advisers and funds that do not proactively address threats and discovered
vulnerabilities face an increased likelihood of having their information systems, and the adviser
or fund information residing therein, compromised.
e. Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery
As an element of an adviser’s or fund’s reasonable policies and procedures, the proposed
cybersecurity risk management rules would require advisers and funds to have measures to
detect, respond to, and recover from a cybersecurity incident.45 These include policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure:
(1) Continued operations of the fund or adviser;
(2) The protection of adviser information systems and the fund or adviser information
residing therein;
(3) External and internal cybersecurity incident information sharing and communications;
and
(4) Reporting of significant cybersecurity incidents to the Commission.
46
Finally, the proposed rules would require advisers and funds to prepare written documentation of
any cybersecurity incident, including their response and recovery from such an incident.
 45 Proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(5) and 38a-2(a)(5).
46 Incident and response recovery are common elements of many cybersecurity frameworks. See, e.g., NIST
Framework, supra footnote 24 (setting out incident response and recovery functions and categories, such as
planning, improvements (e.g., lessons learned), and communication, in connection with an organization’s
risk management processes).
Cybersecurity incidents can lead to significant business disruptions, including losing the
ability to communicate or the ability to access accounts or investments. These incidents also can
lead to the unauthorized access or use of adviser or fund information. Having policies and
procedures reasonably designed to respond to cybersecurity incidents can help mitigate these
significant business disruptions. A cybersecurity program with a clear incident response plan
designed to ensure continued operational capability, and the protection of, and access to,
sensitive information and data, even if an adviser or fund loses access to its systems, would assist
in mitigating the effects of a cybersecurity incident. Advisers and funds, therefore, may wish to
consider maintaining physical copies of their incident response plans—and other cybersecurity
policies and procedures—to help ensure they can be accessed and implemented during the times
they may be needed most.
We believe it is critical for advisers and funds to focus on operational capability,
including resiliency and capacity of information systems, so that they can continue to provide
services to their clients and investors when facing disruptions resulting from cybersecurity
incidents. The ability to recover critical systems or technologies, including those provided by
service providers, in a timeframe that meets business requirements, is important to mitigate the
consequences of cybersecurity incidents. An adviser or fund may consider implementing
safeguards, such as backing up data, which can help facilitate a prompt recovery to allow an
adviser or fund to resume operations following a cybersecurity incident that leads to the
unauthorized access or use of adviser or fund information.
47
An incident response plan should also designate adviser or fund personnel to perform
specific roles in the case of a cybersecurity incident. This would entail identifying and/or hiring
personnel or third parties who have the requisite cybersecurity and recovery expertise (or are
able to coordinate effectively with outside experts) as well as identifying personnel who should
 47 Because having easily accessible, accurate backup data could be critical when responding to and recovering
from a cybersecurity incident, advisers and funds may wish to consider storing sensitive backup data in
immutable, multi-tiered online and offline storage systems.
be kept informed throughout the response and recovery process. In addition, an incident
response plan should generally have a clear escalation protocol to ensure that an adviser’s and
fund’s senior officers, including appropriate legal and compliance personnel, and a fund’s board
(as applicable) receive necessary information regarding cybersecurity incidents on a timely basis.
Moreover, under proposed rule 204-6 and amendments to Form ADV Part 2A, as well as
amendments to funds’ disclosure requirements, advisers and funds would have to report any
significant cybersecurity incidents to the Commission and make appropriate disclosures to their
clients and investors.48 Accordingly, advisers and funds must include provisions in their policies
and procedures designed to ensure their compliance with their reporting and disclosure
obligations as part of their cybersecurity incident response.
49
Advisers and funds should also consider testing their incident response plans to assess
their efficacy and to determine whether any changes are necessary, for example, through tabletop
or full-scale exercises. As part of the annual review of their policies and procedures, advisers
and funds are required to review and assess the design and effectiveness of the policies and
procedures and should generally consider amendments to correct any identified weaknesses in
their design or effectiveness.

We request comment on the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules:
Are the proposed elements of the cybersecurity policies and procedures appropriate?
Should we modify or delete any of the proposed elements? Why or why not? For
example, should advisers and funds be required, as proposed, to conduct a risk
assessment as part of their cybersecurity policies and procedures? Should we require
 48 See proposed rule 204-6; see also infra sections II.B and C.
49 Although an adviser’s or a fund’s initial focus may be on protecting its clients and investors, it may also
wish to implement a process to determine promptly whether and how to contact local and Federal law
enforcement authorities, such as the FBI, about an incident. The FBI has instructed individuals and
organizations to contact their nearest FBI field office to report cybersecurity incidents or to report them
online at https://www.ic3.gov/Home/FileComplaint. See also FBI, What We Investigate, Cyber Crime,
available at https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber (last visited Feb. 2, 2022).
50 See proposed rules 206(4)-9(b) and 38a-2(b).
that a risk assessment include specific components (e.g., identification and
documentation of vulnerabilities and threats, identification of the business effect of
threats and likelihood of incidents occurring, identification and prioritization of
responses), or require written documentation for risk assessments? Should the rules
require policies and procedures related to user security and access, as well as
information protection?
Should there be additional or more specific requirements for who would implement
an adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity program? For example, should we require an
adviser or fund to specify an individual, such as a chief information security officer,
or group of individuals as responsible for implementing the program or parts thereof?
Why or why not? If so, should such an individual or group of individuals be required
to have certain qualifications or experience related to cybersecurity, and if so, what
type of qualifications or experience should be required?
The Investment Company Act compliance rule prohibits the fund’s officers, directors,
employees, adviser, principal underwriter, or any person acting under the direction of
these persons, from directly or indirectly taking any action to coerce, manipulate,
mislead or fraudulently influence the fund’s chief compliance officer in the
performance of her responsibilities under the rule in order to protect the chief
compliance officer from undue influence by those seeking to conceal non-compliance
with the Federal securities laws. Should we adopt a similar prohibition for those
administering a fund’s or adviser’s cybersecurity policies and procedures? Why or
why not?
Would advisers and funds expect to use sub-advisers or other third parties to
administer their cybersecurity programs? If so, to what extent and in what manner?
Should there be additional or specific requirements for advisers and funds that
delegate cybersecurity management responsibilities to a sub-adviser or third party? If
so, what requirements and why?
Should we include any other cybersecurity program administration requirements? If
so, what? For example, should we include a requirement for training staff responsible
for day-to-day management of the program? If we require such training, should that
involve setting minimum qualifications for staff responsible for carrying out the
requirements of the program? Why or why not?
Are the proposed rules’ definitions appropriate and clear? If not, how could these
definitions be clarified within the context of the proposed rules? Should any be
modified or eliminated? Are any of them proposed terms too broad or too narrow?
Are there other terms that we should define?
What are best practices that commenters have developed or are aware of with respect
to the types of measures that must be implemented as part of the proposed
cybersecurity risk management rules or, alternatively, are there any measures that
commenters have found to be ineffective or relatively less effective?
What user measures do advisers currently have for using mobile devices or other
ways to access adviser or fund information systems remotely? Should we require
advisers and funds to implement specific measures to secure remote access
technologies?
Do advisers and funds currently conduct periodic assessments of their information
systems to monitor and protect information from unauthorized use? If so, how often
do advisers and funds conduct such assessments? Should the proposed rules specify a
minimum assessment frequency, and if so, what should that frequency be?
Other than what is required to be reported under proposed rule 204-6, should we
require any specific measures within an adviser’s policies and procedures with
respect to cybersecurity incident response and recovery?
Should we require that advisers and funds respond to cybersecurity incidents within a
specific timeframe? If so, what would be an appropriate timeframe?
Should we require advisers and funds to assess the compliance of all service
providers that receive, maintain, or process adviser or fund information, or are
otherwise permitted to access adviser or fund information systems and any adviser or
fund information residing therein, with these proposed cybersecurity risk
management rules? Should we expand or narrow this set of service providers? For
example, with respect to funds, should this requirement only apply to “named service
providers” as discussed above?
How do advisers and funds currently consider cybersecurity risks when choosing
third-party service providers? What due diligence with respect to cybersecurity is
involved in selecting a service provider?
How do advisers and funds reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident transferring
from the service provider (or a fourth party (i.e., a service provider used by one of an
adviser’s or fund’s service providers)) to the adviser today?
Should we require advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity policies and procedures to
require oversight of certain service providers, including that such service providers
implement and maintain appropriate measures designed to protect a fund’s or an
adviser’s information and information systems pursuant to written contract? Do
advisers and funds currently include specific cybersecurity and data protection
provisions in their agreements with service providers? If so, what provisions are the
most important? Do they address potential cybersecurity risks that could result from
a cybersecurity incident occurring at a fourth party? Should any contractual
provisions be specifically required as part of these rules? Should this requirement
apply to a more limited subset of service providers? If so, which service providers?
For example, should we require funds to include such provisions in their agreements
with advisers that would be subject to proposed rule 206(4)-9? Are there other ways
we should require protective actions by service providers?
Do advisers or funds currently consider their or their service providers’ insurance
policies, if any, when responding to cybersecurity incidents? Why or why not?
Are advisers and funds currently able to obtain information from or about their
service providers’ cybersecurity practices (e.g., policies, procedures, and controls) to
effectively assess them? What, if any, challenges do advisers and funds currently
have in obtaining such information? Are certain advisers or funds (e.g., smaller or
larger firms) more easily able to obtain such information?
2. Annual Review and Required Written Reports
The proposed cybersecurity risk management rules would require advisers and funds to
review their cybersecurity policies and procedures no less frequently than annually.51 Advisers
and funds must, at least annually: (1) review and assess the design and effectiveness of the
cybersecurity policies and procedures, including whether they reflect changes in cybersecurity
risk over the time period covered by the review; and (2) prepare a written report. The report
would, at a minimum, describe the annual review, assessment, and any control tests performed,
explain the results thereof, document any cybersecurity incident that occurred since the date of
the last report, and discuss any material changes to the policies and procedures since the date of
the last report.
The annual review requirement is designed to require advisers and funds to evaluate
whether their cybersecurity policies and procedures continue to work as designed and whether
changes are needed to assure their continued effectiveness, including oversight of any delegated
responsibilities. The written report should be prepared or overseen by the persons who
administer the adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures and should consider any
 51 Proposed rules 206(4)-9(b) and 38a-2(b). As discussed below, the proposed rules would require funds’
boards of directors to review funds’ required written reports. See infra section II.A.3.
risk assessments performed by the adviser or fund. We recognize that a cybersecurity expert
may provide needed expertise and perspective to the annual review, but additional adviser or
fund personnel generally should also participate to provide their organizational perspective, as
well as ensure accountability and appropriate resources.
We request comment on the proposed requirements for a review and assessment of the
policies and procedures and a related written report:
Should there be additional, fewer, or more specific requirements for the annual
review or written report? Why or why not?
Is the proposed requirement for advisers and funds to review their cybersecurity
policies and procedures at least annually appropriate? Is this minimum review period too
long or too short? Why or why not?
Should the annual review include whether the cybersecurity policies and procedures
reflect changes in cybersecurity risk over the time period covered by the review? Why or
why not?
Should management, a cybersecurity officer, or a centralized committee be
designated to conduct the annual review and prepare the report? Would additional
specificity promote accountability and adequate resources? Should relevant expertise be
required? Why or why not?
Would the proposed annual review raise any particular challenges for smaller or
different types of advisers or funds? If so, what could we do to help mitigate these
challenges?
Are there any conflicts of interest if the same adviser or fund officers implement the
cybersecurity program and also conduct the annual review? How can those conflicts be
mitigated or eliminated? Should advisers and funds be required to have their
cybersecurity policies and procedures periodically audited by an independent third party
to assess their design and effectiveness? Why or why not? If so, are there particular
cybersecurity-focused audits or assessments that should be required, and should any such
audits or assessments be required to be performed by particular professionals (e.g.,
certified public accountants)? Would there be any challenges in obtaining such audits,
particularly for smaller advisers or funds?
3. Fund Board Oversight
Proposed rule 38a-2 would require a fund’s board of directors, including a majority of its
independent directors, initially to approve the fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures, as
well as to review the written report on cybersecurity incidents and material changes to the fund’s
cybersecurity policies and procedures that, as described above, would be required to be prepared
at least annually.52 These requirements are designed both to facilitate the board’s oversight of
the fund’s cybersecurity program and provide accountability for the administration of the
program. These requirements also would be consistent with a board’s duty to oversee other
aspects of the management and operations of a fund.53 Board oversight should not be a passive
activity, and the requirements for the board to initially approve the fund’s cybersecurity policies
and procedures and thereafter to review the required written reports are designed to assist
directors in understanding a fund’s cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, as
well as the risks they are designed to address.
A fund’s independent directors play an important role in overseeing fund activities.54 We
believe this should include reviewing and initially approving a fund’s cybersecurity policies and
procedures to help ensure that the fund’s adviser has committed sufficient resources to the
 52 Proposed rule 38a-2(c). The board may satisfy its obligation to approve a fund’s cybersecurity policies and
procedures by reviewing summaries of those policies and procedures. This is similar to how directors may
satisfy their obligations under rule 38a-1. See Compliance Program Release, supra footnote 10, at n.33.
53 See, e.g., rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act; Compliance Program Release, supra footnote 10,
at n.31.
54 Fund directors are commonly referred to as “independent directors” if they are not “interested persons” of
the fund. The term “interested person” is defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act [15
U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19)]. If the fund is a unit investment trust, the fund’s principal underwriter or depositor
must approve the policies and procedures. Proposed rule 38a-2(d). Fund boards, including a majority of
independent directors, approve fund advisory contracts, among other oversight functions. See Section
15(c) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-15(c)]. See also rule 38a-1 under the Investment
Company Act.
activity. Directors may satisfy their obligation with respect to the initial approval by reviewing
summaries of the cybersecurity program prepared by persons who administer the fund’s
cybersecurity policies and procedures. Any documentation provided to the board with respect to
the initial approval should generally serve to familiarize directors with the salient features of the
program and provide them with an understanding of the operation and administration of the
program. In considering whether to approve the policies and procedures, a board may wish to
consider the fund’s exposure to cybersecurity risks, including those of its service providers, as
appropriate, and any recent threats and incidents to which the fund may have been subject.
The required written reports also would provide fund directors with information
necessary to ask questions and seek relevant information regarding the effectiveness of the
program and its implementation, and whether the fund has adequate resources with respect to
cybersecurity matters, including access to cybersecurity expertise. We anticipate that a fund’s
board’s review of the written reports would naturally involve inquiries about cybersecurity risks
arising from the program and any incidents that have occurred.
Boards should also consider what level of oversight of the fund’s service providers is
appropriate with respect to cybersecurity based on the fund’s operations. For example, a board
may review the service provider contract and risk assessment (or summaries thereof) of any
service providers that receive, maintain or process fund information, or that are permitted to
access their information systems, including the information residing therein and the
cybersecurity risks they present, in the required written reports. Generally, the board should
follow up regarding any questions on the contracts or weaknesses found in the risk assessments
as well as the steps the fund has taken to address the fund’s overall cybersecurity risks, including
as those risks may change over time.
We request comment on the proposed initial board approval of the fund’s cybersecurity
policies and procedures, as well as the proposed requirement for the board to review the written
reports that would be prepared at least annually under the proposed rules:
Should the Commission require a fund’s board, including a majority of its
independent directors, initially to approve the cybersecurity policies and procedures,
as proposed? As an alternative, should the Commission require approval by the
board, but not specify that this approval also must include approval by a majority of
the fund’s directors who are not interested persons of the fund? Why or why not?
As part of their oversight function, should fund boards also be required to approve the
cybersecurity policies and procedures of certain of the fund’s service providers (e.g.,
its investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, and transfer agent)? Why
or why not? If so, which service providers should be included and why?
Should a fund’s board, or some designee such as a sub-committee or cybersecurity
expert, have oversight over the fund’s risk assessments of service providers? Why or
why not?
Should the Commission require boards to base their approval of cybersecurity
policies and procedures on any particular finding, for example, that that they are
reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Federal securities laws or reasonably
designed to address the fund’s cybersecurity risks? Why or why not?
Does the release provide adequate guidance to funds’ boards regarding their initial
approval of the cybersecurity policies and procedures? Why or why not? Should the
Commission provide any additional guidance in this regard? If so, what guidance
would assist boards in their approval process? For example, should the Commission
provide additional guidance on documentation provided to the board with respect to
the initial approval?
Is the proposed requirement for fund boards to review the required written reports
appropriate? The proposed rules would require these reports to be prepared at least
annually, and a fund’s board would be required to review each such report that is
prepared. Should the Commission instead require periodic reviews of a report on the
fund’s cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, or specify a shorter or
longer frequency for review of such a report? Why or why not?
Should the Commission require boards to approve any material changes to the fund’s
cybersecurity policies and procedures instead of reviewing a written report that
discusses such changes? Why or why not?
4. Recordkeeping
As part of the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules, we are proposing new
recordkeeping requirements under the Advisers Act and Investment Company Act. Advisers Act
rule 204-2, the books and records rule, sets forth requirements for maintaining, making, and
retaining books and records relating to an adviser’s investment advisory business. We are
proposing to amend this rule to require advisers to maintain: (1) a copy of their cybersecurity
policies and procedures formulated pursuant to proposed rule 206(4)-9 that are in effect, or at
any time within the past five years were in effect; (2) a copy of the adviser’s written report
documenting the annual review of its cybersecurity policies and procedures pursuant to proposed
rule 206(4)-9 in the last five years; (3) a copy of any Form ADV-C filed by the adviser under
rule 204-6 in the last five years; (4) records documenting the occurrence of any cybersecurity
incident, including any records related to any response and recovery from such an incident, in the
last five years; and (5) records documenting an adviser’s cybersecurity risk assessment in the last
five years.55 Records documenting the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident may include event
or incident logs, as well as longer descriptions depending on the nature and scope of the incident.
These proposed amendments would help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and enforcement
capabilities.
Similarly, proposed rule 38a-2 under the Investment Company Act would require that a
fund maintain: (1) a copy of its cybersecurity policies and procedures that are in effect, or at any
time within the last five years were in effect; (2) copies of written reports provided to its board;
 55 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(17)(i), (iv) through (vii).
(3) records documenting the fund’s annual review of its cybersecurity policies and procedures;
(4) any report of a significant fund cybersecurity incident provided to the Commission by its
adviser; (5) records documenting the occurrence of any cybersecurity incident, including any
records related to any response and recovery from such an incident; and (6) records documenting
the fund’s cybersecurity risk assessment.
56 These records would have to be maintained for five
years, the first two years in an easily accessible place.57
We request comments on the proposed recordkeeping requirements:
Are the records that we propose to require advisers and funds to keep relating to the
proposed cybersecurity risk management rules appropriate? Why or why not?
Should advisers and funds have to keep any additional or fewer records, and if so,
what records?
Do advisers or funds have concerns it will be difficult to retain any of documents?
Could this place an undue burden on smaller advisers or funds?
B. Reporting of Significant Cybersecurity Incidents to the Commission
We are proposing a new reporting rule requirement and related proposed Form ADV-C.
Advisers would be required to report significant cybersecurity incidents to the Commission,
including on behalf of a client that is a registered investment company or business development
company, or a private fund (referred to in this release as “covered clients”) that experiences a
significant cybersecurity incident. Specifically, under proposed rule 204-6, any adviser
registered or required to be registered with the Commission as an investment adviser would be
required to submit proposed Form ADV-C promptly, but in no event more than 48 hours, after
having a reasonable basis to conclude that a significant adviser cybersecurity incident or a
 56 See proposed rule 38a-2(e). If the fund is a unit investment trust, copies of materials provided to its
principal underwriter or depositor should be maintained for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year
in which the documents were provided.
57 See proposed rule 38a-2(e). A copy of the fund’s policies and procedures that are in effect, or were at any
time within the past five years in effect, must be kept in an easily accessible place for five years. See
proposed rule 38a-2(e)(1).
significant fund cybersecurity incident had occurred or is occurring.58 Form ADV-C would
include both general and specific questions related to the significant cybersecurity incident, such
as the nature and scope of the incident as well as whether any disclosure has been made to any
clients and/or investors.59 Proposed rule 204-6 would also require advisers to amend any
previously filed Form ADV-C promptly, but in no event more than 48 hours, after information
reported on the form becomes materially inaccurate; if new material information about a
previously reported incident is discovered; and after resolving a previously reported incident or
closing an internal investigation pertaining to a previously disclosed incident.
This reporting would help us in our efforts to protect investors in connection with
cybersecurity incidents by providing prompt notice of these incidents. We believe this proposed
reporting would allow the Commission and its staff to understand the nature and extent of a
particular cybersecurity incident and the firm’s response to the incident. As stated above, this
reporting would not only help the Commission monitor and evaluate the effects of the
cybersecurity incident on an adviser and its clients or a fund and its investors, but also assess the
potential systemic risks affecting financial markets more broadly. For example, these reports
could assist the Commission in identifying patterns and trends across registrants, including
widespread cybersecurity incidents affecting multiple advisers and funds.
1. Proposed Rule 204-6
Proposed rule 204-6 would require investment advisers to report on Form ADV-C within
48 hours after having a reasonable basis to conclude that a significant adviser cybersecurity
incident or a significant fund cybersecurity incident occurred or is occurring. The rule would
define a significant adviser cybersecurity incident as a cybersecurity incident, or a group of
related incidents, that significantly disrupts or degrades the adviser’s ability, or the ability of a
private fund client of the adviser, to maintain critical operations, or leads to the unauthorized
 58 See proposed rules 204-6 and 38a-2.
59 See proposed Form ADV-C.
access or use of adviser information, where the unauthorized access or use of such information
results in: (1) substantial harm to the adviser, or (2) substantial harm to a client, or an investor in
a private fund, whose information was accessed.60
The first prong of the definition of significant adviser cybersecurity incident includes a
cybersecurity incident, or a group of related cybersecurity incidents, that significantly disrupts or
degrades the adviser’s ability, or the ability of a private fund client of the adviser, to maintain
critical operations. If an adviser were unable to maintain critical operations, such as the ability to
implement its investment strategy, process or record transactions, or communicate with clients,
there is potential for substantial loss to both the adviser and its clients. For example, if an
adviser’s internal computer systems, including its websites or email function, are shut down due
to malware, it could have a significant effect on the ability for the adviser to continue to provide
advisory services and for the adviser’s clients to access their investments or communication with
the adviser. In such a situation, it is possible that the adviser’s employees would not be able to
access the computer systems they need to make trades or manage a client’s portfolio, and
advisory clients may not be able to access their accounts through the adviser’s webpage or other
channels that were affected by the malware.
61 Depending on the type of malware, this could
lock up advisory client records, among other things, and affect an adviser’s decision-making and
investments for days, or even weeks. This in turn could potentially affect the market,
particularly if other advisers are similarly targeted with the same malware. Reporting to the
Commission the occurrence of such an incident, we believe, could help the Commission monitor
and evaluate the effects of the event on an adviser or fund and its clients and investors, and the
 60 See proposed rule 204-6(b); see also proposed rule 206(4)-9. This proposed definition is substantially
similar to the proposed definition of “significant fund cybersecurity incident” for funds. We view critical
operations as including investment, trading, reporting, and risk management of an adviser or fund as well as
operating in accordance with the Federal securities laws.
61 Account access could also be affected by denial of service (“DoS”) attacks that disrupt customer access for
extended periods of time. We understand that DoS attacks are often accompanied by ransom demands to
stop any attack and/or are used as a diversionary measure to exfiltrate (or remove) information or probe
further into business networks.
broader financial markets. For example, reporting by a large adviser or a series of advisers of
similar occurrences could signal a market-wide event requiring Commission attention and, if
necessary, coordination with other governmental agencies.
Under the proposed rules, a significant adviser cybersecurity incident would also include
significant cybersecurity incidents affecting private fund clients of an adviser. Given that a
cybersecurity incident that significantly disrupts or degrades the ability of a private fund to
maintain its critical operations could potentially cause similar substantial losses to the adviser
and private fund investors, and that private funds play a significant role in the financial industry,
we believe that such incidents should be reported as well.
The second prong of the definition of a significant adviser cybersecurity incident would
include a cybersecurity incident that leads to unauthorized access or use of adviser information,
where the unauthorized access or use of such information results in: (1) substantial harm to the
adviser, or (2) substantial harm to a client, or an investor in a private fund, whose information
was accessed.62 Substantial harm to an adviser as the result of a cybersecurity incident in which
adviser information is compromised could include, among other things, significant monetary loss
or theft of intellectual property. Substantial harm to a client or an investor in a private fund as
the result of a cybersecurity incident in which adviser information is compromised could include,
among other things, significant monetary loss or the theft of personally identifiable or proprietary
information.63 After gaining access to an adviser’s or a fund’s systems, an attacker could use
this access to disclose, modify, delete or destroy adviser, fund, or client data, as well as steal
intellectual property and client assets. Any of these actions could result in substantial harm to
the adviser and/or to the client.
 62 Proposed rule 204-6(b). There may be times where an incident meets both prongs. For example, a breach
of an adviser’s internal computer systems may affect the adviser’s ability to maintain critical operations as
well as result in substantial harm to the adviser, its clients, or investors in private fund clients of the
adviser.
63 When considering their obligations under these proposed reporting and risk management requirements,
advisers and funds should also keep in mind their obligations with respect to safeguarding client
information, such as those required by Regulation S-P and under an adviser’s fiduciary duty.
In addition to reporting significant cybersecurity incidents for itself and its private fund
clients, an adviser would also have to report significant fund cybersecurity incidents on Form
ADV-C for its registered fund and BDC clients. Similar to a significant adviser cybersecurity
incident, a significant fund cybersecurity incident has two prongs, that it: (1) significantly
disrupts or degrades the fund’s ability to maintain critical operations, or (2) leads to the
unauthorized access or use of fund information, which results in substantial harm to the fund, or
to the investor whose information was accessed.64 Significant fund cybersecurity incidents may
include cyber intruders interfering with a fund’s ability to redeem investors, calculate NAV or
otherwise conduct its business. Other significant fund cybersecurity incidents may involve the
theft of fund information, such as non-public portfolio holdings, or personally identifiable
information of the fund’s employees, directors or shareholders.
In order to assist the adviser in reporting a significant fund cybersecurity incident, a
fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures must address the proposed notification requirement
to the Commission on Form ADV-C. Generally, these provisions of the policies and procedures
should address communications between the person(s) who administer the fund’s cybersecurity
policies and procedures and the adviser about cybersecurity incidents, including those affecting
the fund’s service providers.
An adviser would have to report within 48 hours after having a reasonable basis to
conclude that any significant adviser or fund cybersecurity incident has occurred or is occurring
with respect to itself or any of its clients that are covered clients.
65 In other words, an adviser
must report within 48 hours after having a reasonable basis to conclude that an incident has
occurred or is occurring, and not after definitively concluding that an incident has occurred or is
occurring. The 48-hour period would give an adviser time to confirm its preliminary analysis,
 64 See proposed rules 204-6(b) and 38a-2.
65 We believe that an adviser would generally gather relevant information and perform an initial analysis to
assess whether to reasonably conclude that a cybersecurity incident has occurred or is occurring and follow
its own internal communication and escalation protocols concerning such an incident before providing
notification of any significant cybersecurity incident to the Commission.
and prepare the report while still providing the Commission with timely notice about the
incident.
We are also requiring that advisers amend a previously filed Form ADV-C promptly, but
in no event more than 48 hours, in connection with certain incidents. Advisers would be
required to update the Commission by filing an amended Form ADV-C if any previously
reported information about a significant cybersecurity incident becomes materially inaccurate or
if the adviser discovers new material information related to an incident.66 We are also proposing
to require advisers to file a final Form ADV-C amendment after the resolution of any significant
cybersecurity incident or after closing any internal investigation related to a previously disclosed
incident.67 We believe requiring advisers to amend Form ADV-C in these circumstances would
help to ensure the Commission has accurate and timely information with respect to significant
adviser and fund cybersecurity incidents to allocate resources better when evaluating and
responding to these incidents. While advisers and funds have other incentives to investigate and
remediate significant cybersecurity incidents, we believe these ongoing reporting obligations
would further encourage advisers and funds to take the steps necessary to do so completely.
Moreover, based on our experience with other regulatory filings, we believe it is likely that an
adviser could regularly engage in a productive dialogue with applicable Commission staff after
the reporting of an incident and the filing of any amendments to Form ADV-C, and, as part of
that dialogue, could provide Commission staff with any additional information as necessary,
depending on the facts and circumstances of the incident and the progress in resolving it.
We request comments on the proposed reporting rule 204-6 and the reporting thresholds.
Should we require advisers to report significant cybersecurity incidents of the adviser
and covered clients with the Commission? Why or why not? Alternatively, should
we exclude incidents that affect private fund clients of an adviser? Should we
 66 See proposed rule 204-6(a)(2)(i) and (ii).
67 See proposed rule 204-6(a)(2)(iii).
exclude registered funds and BDCs as covered clients? If so, should we require them
to report to the Commission in another manner? How should the Commission
address funds that are internally managed? Should we require a separate reporting
requirement under the Investment Company Act for such funds? If so, should it be
substantially similar to the proposed reporting requirements under rule 204-6?
Should we require advisers to report on significant cybersecurity incidents of other
pooled investment vehicle clients? For example, should we require advisers to report
on significant cybersecurity incidents of pooled investment vehicles that rely on the
exemption from the definition of “investment company” in section 3(c)(5)(C) of that
Act?68
Who should be responsible for having a reasonable basis to conclude that there has
been a significant adviser cybersecurity incident or significant fund cybersecurity
incident or that one is occurring? Should the Commission require a person or role be
designated to be the one responsible for gathering relevant information about the
incident and having a reasonable basis to conclude that such an incident occurred?
At what point would one conclude that there has been a significant adviser
cybersecurity incident or significant fund cybersecurity incident? Would it be after
some reasonable period of assessment or some other point?
Are the proposed definitions of significant adviser cybersecurity incident and
significant fund cybersecurity incident appropriate and clear? If not, how could they
be made clearer? Should the term critical operations be defined for advisers and
funds, and if so what adviser and fund operations should be considered critical? For
example, should critical operations include the investment, trading, valuation,
 68 Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act provides an exclusion from the definition of investment
company for any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount
certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in
the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.
reporting, and risk management of the adviser or fund as well as the operation of the
adviser or fund in accordance with the Federal securities laws? Alternatively, should
there be a quantitative threshold at which operations must be impaired by a
cybersecurity incident before an adviser’s or fund’s obligation to report is triggered
(for example, maintaining operations at minimally 80% of current levels on any
function)? If so, what should that threshold be and how should an adviser or fund
measure its operational capacity to determine whether that threshold has been
crossed?
Is the proposed “substantial harm” threshold under the definition of significant
adviser and fund cybersecurity incident appropriate? Should we also include
“inconvenience” as a threshold with respect to shareholders, clients and investors? In
other words, should we also require reporting if the unauthorized access or use of
such information results in substantial harm or inconvenience to a shareholder, client,
or an investor in a private fund, whose information was accessed?
Do commenters believe requiring the report 48 hours after having a reasonable basis
to conclude that there has been a significant adviser cybersecurity incident or
significant fund cybersecurity incident or that one is occurring is appropriate? If not,
is it too long or too short? Should we require a specific time frame at all? Do
commenters believe that “a reasonable basis” is a clear standard? If not, what other
standard should we use?
Should we provide for one or more exceptions to the reporting of significant
cybersecurity incidents, for example for smaller advisers or funds? Are there ways,
other than the filing of Form ADV-C, we should require advisers to notify the
Commission regarding significant cybersecurity incidents?
The Commission recently proposed current reporting requirements that would require
large hedge fund advisers to file a current report on Form PF within one business day
of the occurrence of a reporting events at a qualifying hedge fund that they advise.69
The proposed reporting events include a significant disruption or degradation of the
reporting fund’s key operations, which could include a significant cybersecurity
incident. If the amendments to Form PF are adopted, should the Commission provide
an exception to the Form ADV-C filing requirements when an adviser has reported
the incident as a current report on Form PF? Alternatively, should the Commission
provide an exception to the Form PF current reporting requirements if the adviser
filed a Form ADV-C in connection with the reporting event?
Should advisers be required to provide the Commission with ongoing reporting about
significant cybersecurity incidents? If so, are the proposed requirements to amend
Form ADV-C promptly, but in no event more than within 48 hours, sufficient for
such reporting? Is this timeframe appropriate? Should we require a shorter or longer
timeframe? Is the materiality threshold for ongoing reports appropriate? Should we
require another mechanism be used for ongoing reporting? For example, should
advisers instead be required to provide periodic reports about significant
cybersecurity incidents that are ongoing? If so, how often should such reports be
required (e.g., every 30 days) and what information should advisers be required to
provide?
2. Form ADV-C
The Commission is proposing a new Form ADV-C to require an adviser to provide
information regarding a significant cybersecurity incident in a structured format through a series
of check-the-box and fill-in-the-blank questions. We believe that collecting information in a
structured format would enhance our staff’s ability to carry out our risk-based examination
program and other risk assessment and monitoring activities effectively. By enhancing
 69 See Amendments to Form PF to Require Current Reporting and Amend Reporting Requirements for Large
Private Equity Advisers and Large Liquidity Fund Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5950
(Jan. 26, 2022).
comparability across multiple filers, the structured format would also assist our staff in assessing
trends in cybersecurity incidents across the industry and accordingly better protect investors from
any patterned cybersecurity threats.
The proposed rule would require Form ADV-C to be filed electronically with the
Commission through the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (“IARD”) platform. We
considered proposing other electronic filing platforms, either maintained by the Commission or
by a third-party contractor. However, we believe that there would likely be efficiencies realized
if the IARD platform is expanded for this purpose, such as the possible interconnectivity of Form
ADV filings and Form ADV-C filings, and possible ease of filing with one password. Moreover,
the IARD platform is a familiar filing system for advisers.
Proposed Form ADV-C would require advisers to report certain information regarding a
significant cybersecurity incident in order to allow the Commission and its staff to understand
the nature and extent of the cybersecurity incident and the adviser’s response to the incident.
Items 1 through 4 request the following information about the adviser: (1) Investment
Advisers Act SEC File Number; (2) full name of investment adviser; (3) name under which
business is conducted; (4) address of principal place of business; and (5) contact information for
an individual with respect to the significant cybersecurity incident being reported: (name, title,
address if different from above, phone, email address). These items are designed to provide the
Commission with basic identifying information regarding the adviser. We anticipate that the
IARD system will pre-populate this information, other than the contact information for the
individual whom should be contacted for additional information about the incident being
reported.
Items 6 through 9 would elicit whether the adviser is reporting a significant adviser
cybersecurity incident or a significant fund cybersecurity incident (or both), the approximate date
the incident occurred, the approximate date the incident was discovered, and whether the
incident is ongoing. This information would provide the Commission with important
background information regarding the incident. This information would also inform the
Commission if the incident presents an ongoing threat and assist the Commission in prioritizing
its outreach to advisers following multiple Form ADV-C filings in the same time period.
Item 10 would require the adviser to disclose whether law enforcement or a government
agency has been notified about the cybersecurity incident. In assessing the risk to the broader
financial market, it may be important for the Commission to coordinate with other governmental
authorities. Therefore, this disclosure would inform the Commission whether an adviser or fund
has already notified local and Federal law enforcement authorities, such as the FBI, or a local or
Federal government agency, such as the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, about an incident.
Items 11 through 15 would require the adviser to provide the Commission with
substantive information about the nature and scope of the incident being reported, including any
actions and planned actions to recover from the incident; whether any data was stolen altered, or
accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose; and whether the significant cybersecurity
incident has been disclosed to the adviser’s clients and/or to investors. When describing the
nature and scope of the incident being reported, advisers generally should describe whether, and
if so how, the incident has affected its critical operations, including which systems or services
have been affected, and whether the incident being reported was the result of a cybersecurity
incident that occurred at a service provider. Further, to the extent an adviser reports a significant
cybersecurity incident that resulted from a cybersecurity incident that occurred at a service
provider, generally the adviser also should describe the services provided to the adviser or funds
it advises by the provider that experienced the incident and how any degradation in those
services have affected the adviser’s—or its registered and private fund clients’—operations.
This information should provide the Commission with sufficient detail regarding the incident to
understand its potential effects and whether the adviser can continue to provide services to its
clients and investors. The information would also help the Commission determine whether the
incident merits further analysis by the Commission and its staff and/or whether the Commission
and its staff should collect additional information from the adviser.
Item 16 would require the adviser to disclose whether the cybersecurity incident is
covered under a cybersecurity insurance policy. This information would assist the Commission
in understanding the potential effect that incident could have on an adviser’s clients. This
information would also be helpful in evaluating the adviser’s response to the incident given that
cybersecurity insurance may require an adviser to take certain actions during and after a
cybersecurity incident.
After realizing a cybersecurity incident has occurred, an adviser may need time to
determine the scope and effect of the incident to provide meaningful responses to these
questions. We recognize that the adviser may be working diligently to investigate and resolve
the cybersecurity incident at the time it would be required to report to the Commission under the
proposed rule. We believe, however, that advisers should have sufficient information to respond
to the proposed questions by the time the filing is due to the Commission. Advisers should only
share information about what is known at the time of filing.
Section 210(a) of the Advisers Act requires information in Form ADV-C to be publicly
disclosed, unless we find that public disclosure is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.70 Form ADV-C would elicit certain information
regarding cybersecurity incidents, the public disclosure of which, we believe, could adversely
affect advisers (and advisory clients) and funds (and their investors). For example, public
disclosure may harm an adviser’s or fund’s ability to mitigate or remediate the cybersecurity
incident, especially if the incident is ongoing. Keeping information related to a cybersecurity
 70 Section 210(a) of the Advisers Act states that “[t]he information contained in any . . . report or amendment
thereto filed with the Commission pursuant to any provision of this title shall be made available to the
public, unless and except insofar as the Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by
order upon application, finds that public disclosure is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.”
incident confidential may serve to guard against the premature release of sensitive information,
while still allowing the Commission to have early notice of the cybersecurity incident.71
Accordingly, our preliminary view is that Form ADV-C should be confidential given that public
disclosure is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors.72
We request comment on all aspects of Form ADV-C, including the following items.
Is IARD the appropriate system for investment advisers to file Form ADV-C with the
Commission? Instead of expanding the IARD system to receive Form ADV-C
filings, should the Commission utilize some other system, such as the Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR)? If so, please explain. What
would be the comparative advantages and disadvantages and costs and benefits of
utilizing a system other than IARD? What other issues, if any, should the
Commission consider in connection with electronic filing?
Should we include any additional items or eliminate any of the items that we have
proposed to include in Form ADV-C? For example, should advisers be required to
disclose any technical information (e.g., about specific information systems,
particular vulnerabilities exploited, or methods of exploitation) about significant
cybersecurity incidents? Should we modify any of the proposed items? If so, how
and why?
 71 Further, as discussed in greater detail below, we are proposing amendments to Form ADV Part 2A and
certain fund registration forms that would require advisers and funds to publicly disclose significant
cybersecurity incidents. Therefore, clients and investors would have access to information regarding
cybersecurity incidents that they may find material, albeit on a different timeline. Further, as discussed in
more detail below, the disclosure requirements we are proposing are designed to provide clients and
investors with clear and meaningful disclosure regarding cybersecurity incidents in a narrative, plainEnglish format, while the information we are proposing to require adviser disclose on Form ADV-C may
be less useful to clients and investors, given its more granular nature and the fact that it may be incomplete
due to the expediency in which it must be reported.
72 Although the Commission does not intend to make Form ADV-C filings public, the Commission or
Commission staff could issue analyses and reports that are based on aggregated, non-identifying Form
ADV-C data, which would otherwise be nonpublic.
Should Form ADV-C be confidential, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require
public disclosure of some or all of the information included in Form ADV-C?
C. Disclosure of Cybersecurity Risks and Incidents
We are also proposing amendments to certain forms used by advisers and funds to require
the disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents to their investors and other market
participants. In particular, we propose amendments to Form ADV Part 2A for advisers and
Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6 for funds. While many advisers and funds
already provide disclosure about cybersecurity risks, we are updating current reporting and
disclosure requirements to address cybersecurity risks and incidents more directly. These
proposed amendments are designed to enhance investor protection by ensuring cybersecurity risk
or incident-related information is available to increase understanding and insight into an
adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity history and risks. These proposed reporting and disclosure
amendments, together with the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules, may also increase
accountability of advisers and funds on cybersecurity issues. The proposed disclosure changes
would also give the Commission and staff greater insight into cybersecurity risks affecting
advisers and funds. This information would enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee
compliance with the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules, and to gain understanding
about the specifics of the policies and procedures that funds adopted under the rules.
1. Proposed Amendments to Form ADV Part 2A
We are proposing amendments to Form ADV Part 2A that are designed to provide clients
and prospective clients with information regarding cybersecurity risks and incidents that could
materially affect the advisory relationship. We believe the proposed amendments would
improve the ability of clients and prospective clients to evaluate and understand relevant
cybersecurity risks and incidents that advisers face and their potential effect on the advisers’
services.
2. Cybersecurity Risks and Incidents Disclosure
The proposed amendments would add a new Item 20 entitled “Cybersecurity Risks and
Incidents” to Form ADV’s narrative brochure, or Part 2A. The brochure, which is publicly
available and the primary client-facing disclosure document, contains information about the
investment adviser’s business practices, fees, risks, conflicts of interest, and disciplinary events.
We believe the narrative format of the brochure would allow advisers to present clear and
meaningful cybersecurity disclosure to their clients and prospective clients.
Advisers would be required to, in plain English, describe cybersecurity risks that could
materially affect the advisory services they offer and how they assess, prioritize, and address
cybersecurity risks created by the nature and scope of their business. A cybersecurity risk,
regardless of whether it has led to a significant cybersecurity incident, would be material to an
adviser’s advisory relationship with its clients if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable
client would consider the information important based on the total mix of facts and
information.
73 The facts and circumstances relevant to determining materiality in this context
may include, among other things, the likelihood and extent to which the cybersecurity risk or
resulting incident: (1) could disrupt (or has disrupted) the adviser’s ability to provide services,
including the duration of such a disruption; (2) could result (or has resulted) in the loss of adviser
or client data, including the nature and importance of the data and the circumstances and duration
in which it was compromised; and/or (3) could harm (or has harmed) clients (e.g., inability to
access investments, illiquidity, or exposure of confidential or sensitive personal or business
information).
The proposed amendments would also require advisers to describe any cybersecurity
incidents that occurred within the last two fiscal years that have significantly disrupted or
degraded the adviser’s ability to maintain critical operations, or that have led to the unauthorized
 73 See, e.g., Amendments to Form ADV, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3060 (July 28, 2010) [75 FR
49233 (Aug.12, 2010)], at n.35 (citing S.E.C. v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 643 (D.C. Cir. 1992); cf. Basic
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-232 (1988); TSC Industries v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 445, 449
(1976)).
access or use of adviser information, resulting in substantial harm to the adviser or its clients. 74
When describing these incidents in their brochures, advisers would be required to identify the
entity or entities affected, when the incidents were discovered and whether they are ongoing,
whether any data was stolen, altered, or accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose, the
effect of the incident on the adviser’s operations, and whether the adviser, or service provider has
remediated or is currently remediating the incident. This information would allow investors to
make more informed decisions when deciding whether to engage or stay with an adviser.
3. Requirement to Deliver Certain Interim Brochure Amendments to
Existing Clients
17 CFR 275.204-3(b) (rule 204-3(b) under the Advisers Act) does not require advisers to
deliver interim brochure amendments to existing clients unless the amendment includes certain
disciplinary information in response to Item 9 Part 2A or Item 3 of Part 2B.
75 We are proposing
an amendment to rule 204-3(b) that would also require an adviser to deliver interim brochure
amendments to existing clients promptly if the adviser adds disclosure of a cybersecurity
incident to its brochure or materially revises information already disclosed in its brochure about
such an incident. Given the potential effect that significant cybersecurity incidents could have
on an adviser’s clients—such as exposing their personal or other confidential information or
resulting in losses in their accounts—time is of the essence, and we believe that requiring an
adviser to promptly deliver the brochure amendment would enhance investor protection by
enabling clients to take protective or remedial measures to the extent appropriate. Accordingly,
the timing of the brochure amendment delivery should take into account the exigent nature of
 74 We believe disclosure covering this look-back period would provide investors a short history of
cybersecurity incidents affecting the adviser while not overburdening the adviser with a longer disclosure
period. Further, this lookback period would foster consistency between adviser and fund disclosures
regarding significant cybersecurity incidents.
75 Even if an adviser is not required to deliver a brochure to an existing client, as a fiduciary the adviser may
still be required to provide clients with similar information. If an adviser is not required to deliver an
existing client a brochure, the adviser may make any required disclosures to that client by delivery of the
brochure or through some other means. See Instruction 1 of Instructions for Part 2A of Form ADV:
Preparing Your Firm Brochure.
cybersecurity incidents which would generally militate toward swift delivery to clients. We also
believe that requiring advisers to deliver the brochure amendment to existing clients following
the occurrence of a new significant cybersecurity incident would assist investors in determining
whether their engagement of that particular adviser remains appropriate and consistent with their
investment objectives.
We seek comment on the Commission’s proposed amendments to Form ADV Part 2A:
Will the proposed cybersecurity disclosures in Item 20 of Form ADV Part 2A be
helpful for clients and investors? Are there additional cybersecurity disclosures we
should consider adding to Item 20? Should we modify or delete any of the proposed
cybersecurity disclosures?
Does the definition of significant adviser cybersecurity incident allow advisers to
inform investors of cybersecurity risks arising from the incident while protecting the
adviser and its clients from threat actors who might use that information for the
current or future attacks? Does this definition allow for disclosures relevant to
investors without providing so much information as to be desensitizing? Why or why
not?
Do the required disclosures provide investors with prompt access to important
information that they need in connection with the decision to engage, or continue to
engage, an adviser? Why or why not?
We propose to require advisers to update their cybersecurity disclosures in Item 20
promptly to the extent the disclosures become materially inaccurate. Do commenters
agree that the lack of disclosure regarding certain cybersecurity risks and
cybersecurity incidents would render an adviser’s brochure materially inaccurate?
Should we only require advisers to update their cybersecurity disclosures on an
annual basis (rather than an ongoing basis, as proposed)?
We propose to require advisers to deliver brochure amendments to existing clients if
the adviser adds disclosure of an event, or materially revises information already
disclosed about an event, that involves a cybersecurity incident in response to
proposed Item 20. Is this delivery requirement appropriate? Why or why not? Are
there other delivery or client-notification requirements that we should consider for
advisers when updates to their cyber security disclosures are made?
Should advisers also be specifically required to disclose if there has not been a
significant cybersecurity incident in its last two fiscal years? Would this disclosure
assist investors in their investment decision-making? Why or why not?
Should the rule include a requirement to disclose whether a significant adviser
cybersecurity incident is currently affecting the adviser? Why or why not? Is the
look-back period of two fiscal years appropriate? Why or why not?
4. Proposed Amendments to Fund Registration Statements
Like advisers, funds would also be required to provide prospective and current investors
with disclosure about significant cybersecurity incidents under our proposal. We are proposing
amendments to funds’ registration forms that would require a description of any significant fund
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in its last two fiscal years, and that funds must tag the
new information that would be included using a structured data language (specifically, Inline
eXtensible Business Reporting Language or “Inline XBRL”).
76 The proposed disclosure
amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration statement whether
a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund or its service
providers.77
 76 We are proposing amendments to Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4, Form N-6, Form N-8B-2,
and Form S-6.
77 The proposed disclosure amendments would also require funds to disclose significant fund cybersecurity
incidents affecting insurance companies (for separate accounts that are management investment companies
that offer variable annuity contracts registered on Form N-3) and depositors (for separate accounts that are
unit investment trusts that offer variable annuity contracts on Form N-4; unit investment trusts that offer
variable life insurance contracts on Form N-6; and unit investment trusts other than separate accounts that
Specifically, the proposed amendments would require a description of each significant
fund cybersecurity incident, including the following information to the extent known: the entity
or entities affected; when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing; whether any
data was stolen, altered, or accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose; the effect of the
incident on the fund’s operations; and whether the fund or service provider has remediated or is
currently remediating the incident. The requirements for disclosure describing the incident
would be similar to the information that new Form ADV-C requires, which we believe would
increase compliance efficiencies for funds and their advisers.
The fund would be required to disclose any significant fund cybersecurity incident that
has occurred during its last two fiscal years. We believe disclosure covering this look-back
period would provide investors a short history of cybersecurity incidents affecting the fund while
not overburdening the fund with a longer disclosure period.78 We believe providing a
description of a significant fund cybersecurity incident would improve the ability of shareholders
and prospective shareholders to evaluate and understand relevant cybersecurity risks and
incidents that a fund faces and their potential effect on the fund’s operations.
In addition to providing investors with information on significant fund cybersecurity
incidents, funds should consider cybersecurity risks when preparing risk disclosures in fund
registration statements under the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act. Funds are
currently required to disclose “principal risks” of investing in the fund, and if a fund determines
that a cybersecurity risk is a principal risk of investing in the fund, the fund should reflect this
information in its prospectus.
79 For example, a fund that has experienced a number of significant

are currently issuing securities, including unit investment trusts that are issuers of periodic payment plan
certificates and unit investment trusts of which a management investment company is the sponsor or
depositor on Form N-8b-2 or Form S-6).
78 The two-year period is consistent with other items in Form N-1A (for example, Item 16(e) (description of
the fund’s portfolio turnover), Item 17(b)(6) through (9) (management of the fund), and Item 31 (business
and other connections of investment adviser). We are proposing a corresponding period for the disclosures
in Part 2A of Form ADV.
79 See Form N-1A, Item 4(b)(1) (narrative risk disclosure), Item 9(c) (risks), and Item 16(b) (investment
fund cybersecurity incidents in a short period of time may need to disclose heightened
cybersecurity risk as a principal risk of investing in the fund. This information would allow
investors to make more informed decisions when deciding whether to invest in a fund.
Funds are required to update their prospectuses so that they do not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact (or omit a material fact necessary to make the disclosure not
misleading).80 To make timely disclosures of cybersecurity risks and significant fund
cybersecurity incidents, a fund would amend its prospectus by filing a supplement with the
Commission.
81 In addition, funds should generally include in their annual reports to
shareholders a discussion of cybersecurity risks and significant fund cybersecurity incidents, to
the extent that these were factors that materially affected performance of the fund over the past
fiscal year.
82
We are proposing to require all funds to tag this information about significant fund
cybersecurity incidents in a structured, machine-readable data language.83 Specifically, we are
proposing to require funds to tag the disclosures in Inline XBRL in accordance with rule 405 of

strategies and risks); Form N-2, Item 8(3) (risk factors); Form N-3, Item 5 (principal risks of investing in
the contract) and Item 22 (investment objectives and risks); Form N-4, Item 5 (principal risks of investing
in the contract) and Item 20 (non-principal risks of investing in the contract); Form N-6, Item 5 (principal
risks of investing in the contract) and Item 21 (non-principal risks of investing in the contract). UITs filing
on Form N-8B-2 must disclose instead information concerning the operations of the trust (Form N-8B-2,
Items 14-24).
80 See generally 17 CFR 230.497 [rule 497 under the Securities Act]; section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act
(providing a civil remedy if a prospectus includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading); 17 CFR 230.408 [rule 408 under the Securities Act] (requiring registrants to
include, in addition to the information expressly required to be included in a registration statement, such
further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading).
81 See 17 CFR 230.497 (open-end funds); 17 CFR 230.424 (closed-end funds).
82 See, e.g., Disclosure of Mutual Fund Performance and Portfolio Managers, Investment Company Act
Release No. 19382 (Apr. 6, 1993) [58 FR 21927 (Apr. 26, 1993)], at n.15 (noting that management’s
discussion of fund performance requires funds to “explain what happened during the previous fiscal year
and why it happened”).
83 Many funds are already required to tag certain registration statement disclosure items using Inline XBRL;
however, UITs that register on Form N-8B-2 and file post-effective amendments on Form S-6 are not
currently subject to any tagging requirements. The costs of these requirements for funds that are currently
subject to tagging requirements and those that newly would be required to tag certain disclosure items are
discussed in the Economic Analysis. See section III.D.2 infra.
Regulation S-T and the EDGAR Filer Manual.84 The proposed requirements would include
block text tagging of narrative information about significant fund cybersecurity incidents, as well
as detail tagging of any quantitative values disclosed within the narrative disclosures.
Many funds are already required to tag certain registration statement disclosure items
using Inline XBRL.85 Requiring Inline XBRL tagging of significant fund cybersecurity
incidents for all funds would benefit investors, other market participants, and the Commission by
making the disclosures more readily available and easily accessible for aggregation, comparison,
filtering, and other analysis, as compared to requiring a non-machine readable data language
such as ASCII or HTML. This would enable automated extraction and analysis of granular data
on significant fund cybersecurity incidents, such as the date the incident was discovered,
allowing investors and other market participants to more efficiently perform large-scale analysis
and comparison across funds and time periods. An Inline XBRL requirement would facilitate
other analytical benefits, such as more easily extracting/searching disclosures about significant
fund cybersecurity incidents, performing targeted assessments (rather than having to manually
run searches for these disclosures through entire documents), and automatically comparing these
disclosures against prior periods. We believe requiring structured data for significant fund
 84 This proposed tagging requirement would be implemented by including cross-references to rule 405 of
Regulation S-T in each fund registration form (and, as applicable, updating references to those fund
registration forms in rule 11 and rule 405), by revising rule 405(b) of Regulation S-T to include the
proposed significant fund cybersecurity incident disclosures, and by proposing conforming amendments to
rule 485 and rule 497 under the Securities Act.
Pursuant to rule 301 of Regulation S-T, the EDGAR Filer Manual is incorporated by reference into the
Commission’s rules. In conjunction with the EDGAR Filer Manual, Regulation S-T governs the electronic
submission of documents filed with the Commission. Rule 405 of Regulation S-T specifically governs the
scope and manner of disclosure tagging requirements for operating companies and investment companies,
including the requirement in rule 405(a)(3) to use Inline XBRL as the specific structured data language to
use for tagging the disclosures.
85 The Commission has adopted rules requiring funds registering on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6 to
submit data using Inline XBRL. See Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting, Release No. 33-9002
(Jan. 30, 2009) [74 FR 6776 (Feb. 10, 2009)] as corrected by Release No. 33-9002A (Apr. 1, 2009) [74 FR
15666 (Apr. 7, 2009)]; Inline XBRL Filing of Tagged Data, Release No. 33-10514 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR

and Variable Life Insurance Contracts, Investment Company Act Release No. 33814 (Mar. 11, 2020) [85

(Oct. 13, 2021) [86 FR 70166 (Dec. 9, 2021)].
cybersecurity incidents for all funds would make cybersecurity disclosure more readily available,
accessible, and comparable for investors, other market participants, and the Commission.
We seek comment on the Commission’s proposed amendments to fund registration
statement disclosure requirements:
Should there be a prospectus disclosure requirement of significant fund cybersecurity
incidents for all registered funds? If some types of funds should be exempt, have
different disclosure requirements, or not be subject to the proposed structured data
requirement, which and why?
Will the proposed cybersecurity disclosures be helpful for shareholders and potential
shareholders? Are there additional cybersecurity disclosures we should add? Should
we modify or delete any of the proposed cybersecurity disclosures?
Does the definition of significant fund cybersecurity incident allow funds to inform
investors of cybersecurity risks arising from the incident while protecting the fund
from threat actors who might use that information for the current or future attacks?
Does this definition allow for disclosures relevant to investors without providing so
much information as to be desensitizing? Why or why not?
Should the rule include a requirement to disclose whether a significant fund
cybersecurity incident is currently affecting the fund as proposed? Why or why not?
How often should cybersecurity disclosure be updated? Is the lookback period of two
fiscal years appropriate? Why or why not?
Should the rule include an instruction about significant fund cybersecurity incidents
that may have occurred in the fund’s last two fiscal years but was discovered later?
Why or why not? Should the Commission provide more specific guidance or
requirements on when a fund should update its disclosure to provide information
about a significant fund cybersecurity incident? Should the timing or information
about a significant cybersecurity incident for updated disclosure match the prompt
reporting requirement for advisers on Form ADV-C? Why or why not?
Are there other delivery or shareholder-notification requirements that we should
consider for funds when updates to their cybersecurity disclosures are made? For
example, should there be an alternate website disclosure regime, similar to how proxy
voting records may be disclosed, for cybersecurity incidents? Why or why not? Or
alternatively or additionally, should information about significant fund cybersecurity
incidents be included in funds’ annual reports to shareholders, filed on Form N-CSR,
or reported on Form N-CEN?
Should funds also be specifically required to disclose if there has not been a
significant cybersecurity incident in its last two fiscal years? Would this disclosure
assist investors in their investment decision-making? Why or why not?
Should the Commission provide more specific guidance or requirements on when and
what cybersecurity risk funds should disclose, including when cybersecurity risk
would be considered a principal risk factor? Why or why not?
Should we require all funds to tag significant fund cybersecurity incidents in Inline
XBRL, as proposed? Why or why not?
Should we require funds to use a different structured data language to tag significant
fund cybersecurity incident disclosures? If so, what structured data language should
we require?
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
The Commission is mindful of the economic effects, including the costs and benefits, of
the proposed rules and amendments. Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act, section 2(c) of the
Investment Company Act, and section 202(c) of the Advisers Act provide that when engaging in
rulemaking that requires us to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in or consistent with the public interest, to also consider, in addition to the protection
of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act also requires us to consider the effect that the rules would
have on competition, and prohibits us from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act. The analysis
below addresses the likely economic effects of the proposed amendments, including the
anticipated and estimated benefits and costs of the amendments and their likely effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The Commission also discusses the potential
economic effects of certain alternatives to the approaches taken in this proposal.
The proposed rules and amendments would provide a more specific and comprehensive
framework for advisers and funds to address, report on, and disclose cybersecurity-related risks
and incidents. They would directly affect advisers and funds through changes in their
obligations related to cybersecurity risks. They would also directly affect investment advisers’
and funds’ current and prospective clients and investors. In addition, the proposed rules may
affect third-party service providers to advisers and funds.
We anticipate that the main economic benefits of the proposed rules and amendments
would be to enhance certain advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity preparedness and thereby reduce
related risks to clients and investors, to improve clients’ and investors’ information about
advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity exposures, and to enhance the Commission’s ability to assess
systemic risks and its oversight of advisers and funds. We expect the main economic costs of the
proposed rules and amendments to be compliance costs86 borne by investment advisers and
 86 Throughout this economic analysis, “compliance costs” refers to the direct and indirect costs resulting from
material changes to affected registrants’ business practices that may be required to comply with the
proposed regulations (e.g., conducting cybersecurity analysis of deployed systems, replacing outdated
insecure computer software, hiring staff to implement cybersecurity improvements, renegotiating contracts
with service providers, exposing aspects of secret business practices through mandated disclosures). As
used here, “compliance costs” excludes certain administrative costs of the proposed regulations (e.g., filling
out and filing required forms, conducting legal reviews of mandated disclosures) subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act. These administrative costs are discussed in detail in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis
in section IV.
funds—costs likely to be passed on to their respective clients and investors. We do not
anticipate that these costs and benefits will be material in the aggregate, although they may have
significant effects on individual advisers, funds, and their respective clients and investors.
We expect that the proposed rules and amendments would have a more significant effect
on smaller advisers and smaller fund families as well as their clients and investors. Such
differential impacts would likely have some effect on competition in the adviser and fund
management markets, although the direction of this effect is ambiguous.87 In addition to
providing clients and investors with additional cybersecurity-related information about advisers
and funds, we expect the proposed amendments to increase investors’ confidence in the
operational resiliency of advisers and funds and safety of their investments held through those
firms. In so doing, we expect that the proposed amendments would improve economic
efficiency and enhance capital formation.
Many of the benefits and costs discussed below are difficult to quantify. For example,
the effectiveness of cybersecurity hygiene measures taken as a result of the proposed
amendments on the probability of a cybersecurity incident and on the expected cost of such an
incident, including remediation costs, is subject to numerous assumptions and unknowns, and is
thus impracticable to quantify. Also, in some cases, data needed to quantify these economic
effects are not currently available. For example, the Commission does not have reliable data on
the incidence of cybersecurity incidents for advisers and funds. While we have attempted to
quantify economic effects where possible, much of the discussion of economic effects is
qualitative in nature. The Commission seeks comment on all aspects of the economic analysis,
especially any data or information that would enable a quantification of the proposal’s economic
effects.
 87 Both costs and benefits would have differential effects. See infra section III.E.
B. Broad Economic Considerations
While advisers and funds have private incentives to maintain some level of cybersecurity
hygiene, market failures can lead the privately optimal level to be inadequate from the
perspective of overall economic efficiency: such market failures provide the economic rationale
for regulatory intervention in advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity practices. At the core of these
market failures is asymmetric information about cybersecurity preparations and incidents as well
as negative externalities to these incidents. Asymmetric information contributes to two main
inefficiencies: first, because the production of cybersecurity defenses must constantly evolve, an
adviser’s or fund’s inability to observe cyberattacks on its competitors inhibits the efficacy of its
own cybersecurity preparations. Second, for a client or investor, the inability to observe an
adviser’s or fund’s effort in cybersecurity preparation gives rise to a principal-agent problem that
can contribute to an adviser or fund exerting too little effort (i.e., underinvesting or
underspending) on cybersecurity preparations. Moreover, because there can be substantial
negative externalities related to cybersecurity incidents, advisers’ and funds’ private incentives to
exert effort on cybersecurity preparations are likely to be lower than optimal from a societal
standpoint.
In the production of cybersecurity defenses, the main input is information. In particular,
information about prior attacks and their degree of success is immensely valuable in mounting
effective countermeasures.88 However, firms are naturally reluctant to share such information
freely: doing so can assist future attackers as well as lead to loss of customers, reputational harm,
litigation, or regulatory scrutiny.
89 Moreover, because disclosure of such information creates a
positive information externality90—the benefits of which accrue to society at large and which
 88 See Peter W. Singer and Allan Friedman, Cybersecurity: What Everyone Needs to Know. Oxford
University Press 222 (2014).
89 See, e.g., Federal Trade Commission v. Equifax, Inc. (2019), available at
https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/172-3203/equifax-inc.
90 However, disclosure of this information to parties that do not obey the law creates significant negative
externalities as it can facilitate attacks against those who employ similar business methods and IT systems.
cannot be fully captured by the firm making the disclosure—an inefficient market equilibrium is
likely to arise. In this market equilibrium, too little information about cybersecurity incidents is
disclosed, leading to inefficiently low levels of cybersecurity defense production.91
Asymmetric information also contributes to a principal-agent problem. The relationship
between an adviser and its client or a fund and its investor is one where the principal (the client
or fund investor) relies on an agent (the investment adviser or fund complex and its
management) to perform services on the principal’s behalf.92 Because principals and their agents
do not have perfectly aligned preferences and goals, agents may take actions that increase their
well-being at the expense of principals, thereby imposing “agency costs” on the principals.93
Although private contracts between principals and agents aim to minimize such costs, they are
limited in their ability to do so; this limitation provides one rationale for regulatory
intervention.
94
In the context of cybersecurity, the principal-agent problem is one of underspending in
cybersecurity—agents exerting insufficient effort toward protecting the personal information,
investments, or funds of the principals from being stolen or otherwise compromised. For
example, in a recent survey of financial firms, 58% of the respondents self-reported
“underspending” on cybersecurity.95 Several factors can contribute to this underspending.

See infra section III.D.2.b (discussing the potential costs of excessive disclosure).
91 This problem has long been recognized by policymakers leading to various efforts aimed at encouraging
voluntary information sharing across firms. See infra section III.C.1.
92 See Michael C. Jensen and William H. Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs
and Ownership Structure, 3 Journal of Financial Economics, 305-360 (1976) (“Jensen and Meckling”).
93 Id.
94 Such limitations can arise from un-observability or un-verifiability of actions, transactions costs associated
with including numerous contingencies in contracts, or bounded rationality in the design of contracts. See
e.g. Jean Tirole, Cognition and Incomplete Contracts, 99 (1) American Economic Review, 265–94 (Mar.
2009) (discussing a relatively modern treatment of these issues) (“Tirole”).
95 Institute of International Finance, IIF/McKinsey Cyber Resilience Survey (Mar. 2020), available at
https://www.iif.com/Portals/0/Files/content/cyber_resilience_survey_3.20.2020_print.pdf 2020)
(“IIF/McKinsey Report”). A total of 27 companies participated in the survey, with 23 having a global
footprint. Approximately half of respondents were European or U.S. Globally Systemically Important
Banks (G-SIBs).
Agents (i.e., advisers and funds) may not be able to credibly signal to their principals (i.e., clients
or investors) that they are better at addressing cybersecurity risks than their peers, reducing their
incentives to bear such costs.96 At the same time, agents who do not bear the full cost of a
cybersecurity failure (e.g., losses of their customers’ information or assets) will prefer to avoid
bearing costs—such as elaborate cybersecurity practices—the benefits of which accrue in large
part to principals (i.e., clients and investors).
Agents’ reputation motives—the fear of market-imposed loss of future profits—should
generally work against the tendency for agents to underinvest in cybersecurity measures.
However, for smaller agents—who do not enjoy economies of scale or scope, and generally have
less valuable brands—the cost of implementing robust cybersecurity measures will be relatively
high, while their reputation motives will be more limited. Thus, smaller agents can be expected
to be especially prone to underinvestment.
Even in the absence of agency problems, advisers and funds may still underinvest in
cybersecurity due to negative externalities or moral hazard. In the context of cybersecurity,
negative externalities arise because a disruption to the operation or financial condition of one
financial entity can have significant negative repercussions on the financial system broadly.97
For example, a cybersecurity incident at a large money market fund that affects its ability to
process redemptions could disrupt the fund’s shareholders’ ability to access cash needed to
satisfy other obligations, potentially leading those shareholders to default, which, in turn, could
trigger further defaults by those shareholders’ creditors. Alternatively, a cybersecurity incident
may adversely affect market confidence and curtail economic activity through a confidence

Quality, 24 (3) The Journal of Law and Economics 461–83 (Dec. 1981); see also Michael Spence,

of Economic Theory 296-332 (Mar. 1, 1974); G. A. Akerlof, The Market for “Lemons”: Quality

Proceedings 109, 482-487 (May 2019).
channel.98 As such costs would not be internalized by advisers and funds, advisers and funds
would be expected to underinvest in measures aimed at avoiding such costs. In addition,
advisers and funds may also underinvest in their cybersecurity measures due to moral hazard
from expectations of government support.
99 For example, a large fund may realize that it is an
attractive target for sophisticated state actors aiming to disrupt the U.S. financial system.
Protection against such “advanced persistent threats”100 from sophisticated actors is costly.101 A
belief that such an attack would be met with government support could lead to moral hazard
where the fund underinvests in defenses aimed at countering this threat.
The proposed amendments could mitigate these problems in several ways. First,
establishing explicit requirements for cybersecurity policies and procedures could help ensure
that investment advisers and funds devote a certain minimum amount of effort toward
cybersecurity readiness. Second, the proposed disclosure and regulatory reporting requirements
could help alleviate the information asymmetry problems by providing current and prospective
investors and clients, third parties (e.g., fund rating services), and regulators with more
information about funds’ and advisers’ cybersecurity exposure. The publicly disclosed
information could in turn be used by investors, clients, and third parties to screen and monitor
 98 Id.
99 It has long been noted that it is difficult for governments to commit credibly to not providing support to
entities that are seen as critical to the functioning of the financial system, resulting in problems of moral
hazard. See, e.g., Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street, King (1873). Historically, banking entities seen as “too
big to fail” or “too interconnected to fail” have been the principal recipients of such government support.
Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, non-bank financial institutions (such as investment banks), money
market funds, and insurance companies, as well as specific markets such as the repurchase market have
also benefited. See, e.g., Gary B. Gorton, Slapped by the Invisible Hand: The Panic of 2007, Oxford
University Press (2010). See also Viral V. Acharya, Deniz Anginer, and A. Joseph Warburton, The End of
Market Discipline? Investor Expectations of Implicit Government Guarantees, SSRN Scholarly Paper.

100 Advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to sophisticated cyberattacks by hostile organizations with the goal
of: gaining access to defense, financial and other targeted information from governments, corporations and
individuals; maintaining a foothold in these environments to enable future use and control; and modifying
data to disrupt performance in their targets. See Michael K, Daly, The Advanced Persistent Threat (or
Informationized Force Operations), Usenix LISA 09 (Nov. 4, 2009), available at
https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/lisa09/tech/slides/daly.pdf.

funds and investment advisers, while the confidential regulatory reports could be used by
regulators to inform industry and law enforcement about ongoing threats. Finally, by reducing
uncertainty about the effectiveness of funds’ and investment advisers’ cybersecurity measures,
the proposed amendments could help level the competitive playing field for funds and advisers
by simplifying prospective investors’ and clients’ decision making.
102 By addressing important
market imperfections, the proposed amendments could mitigate underinvestment in
cybersecurity and improve the adviser and fund industry’s ability to produce effective
cybersecurity defenses through better information sharing, which could in turn lead to improved
economic efficiency.
The effectiveness of the proposed amendments at mitigating the aforementioned
problems would depend on several factors. It would depend on the extent to which the proposed
amendments materially affect registrants’ policies and procedures and disclosures. Insofar as the
new requirements affect registrants’ policies and procedures, the effectiveness of the proposed
amendments would also depend on the extent to which the actions they induce alleviate
cybersecurity underinvestment. The effectiveness of the proposed amendments would also
depend on the extent to which the proposed disclosure requirements provide useful information
to investors, clients, third parties, and regulators.
103
C. Baseline
The market risks and practices, regulation, and market structure relevant to the affected
parties in place today form the baseline for our economic analysis. The parties directly affected
by the proposed amendments are advisers that are registered or required to be registered with the
Commission and funds. In addition, the proposed amendments would indirectly affect current

considerably more complex as one would need to consider not only each airline’s price and level of service,
but also the adequacy of each airline’s maintenance regime, the age of its fleet, and the training of its pilots.
103 Similar arguments have been put forward with respect to disclosure’s utility in predicting adviser fraud.
See, e.g., Stephen Dimmock and William Gerken, Predicting Fraud by Investment Managers, 105 (1)
Journal of Financial Economics, 153-173 (2012).
and prospective clients of such advisers (including private funds) and investors in such funds as
well as certain service providers to advisers and funds. Finally, these amendments could also
affect issuers of financial assets whose access to and cost of capital could change because of the
proposed amendments’ effects on the asset management markets.
1. Cybersecurity Risks and Practices
With the widespread adoption of internet-based products and services over the last two
decades, all businesses have had to address issues of cybersecurity. For financial services firms,
the stakes are particularly high—it is where the money is. Cybersecurity threat intelligence
surveys consistently find the financial sector to be one of—if not the most—attacked industry,
104
and remediation costs for such incidents can be substantial.105 The financial services sector has
also been at the forefront of digitization and now represents one the most digitally mature sectors
of the economy.106 Not surprisingly, it is also one of the biggest spenders on cybersecurity
measures: a recent survey found that non-bank financial firms spent an average of approximately
0.5% of revenues—or $2,348/employee—on cybersecurity.107
The ubiquity and rising costs of cybercrime108 along with firm’s increasingly costly
efforts to prevent it109 has created a boom in the cybersecurity industry110 and led to the

(“VentureBeat”).
development of a numerous technologies, standards, and industry noted “best practices” aimed at
mitigating cybersecurity threats. Many of these developments— multi-factor authentication,
HTTPS, and user-access control—are so widely deployed as to be in common parlance. Among
practitioners (chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief security officers
(“CISOs”) and their staffs), best practice frameworks such as Carnegie Mellon University’s
Cyber Resilience Review,
111 the NIST Framework,
112 and similar offerings from cybersecurity
consultants and product vendors are now frequently employed to assess and address institutional
cybersecurity preparedness. Such frameworks cover the gamut of cybersecurity, including: IT
asset management, controls, change management, vulnerability management, incident
management, continuity of operations, risk management, dependencies on third parties, training,
and information sharing. In recent years, company boards and executive management teams
have been paying more attention to many of these areas.113
While spending on cybersecurity measures in the financial services industry is
considerable, it may nonetheless be inadequate—even in the estimation of financial firms
themselves: according to one recent survey, 58% of financial firms self-reported
“underspending” on cybersecurity measures.114 And while adoption of cybersecurity best
practices has been accelerating overall, many firms continue to lag in their adoption.115 While
surveys of financial services firms are suggestive, the true extent of advisers’ and funds’
underspending—and of failing to adopt industry-accepted cybersecurity “best practices”—is
impracticable to quantify.116

116 As noted in section III.B, the quality of cybersecurity measures is difficult to quantify. Moreover, the
Similarly, it is impracticable to quantify the adequacy of advisers’ and funds’ information
sharing arrangements.117 The value of such information sharing has long been recognized. In
1998, Presidential Decision Directive 63 established industry-based information sharing and
analysis centers (“ISACs”) to promote the disclosure and sharing of cybersecurity information
among firms.118 The FS-ISAC provides financial firms with such a forum.119 However,
observers have questioned the efficacy of these information-sharing partnerships,120 while the
U.S. Government has continued in attempts to further such efforts. For example, President
Obama’s 2015 Executive Order, “Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing”
aimed “to encourage the voluntary formation of [information sharing organizations], to establish
mechanisms to continually improve the capabilities and functions of these organizations, and to
better allow these organizations to partner with the Federal Government on a voluntary basis.”121
Although the Commission does not have data on the extent of advisers’ and funds’ use of such
forums or their efficacy, surveys of securities firms conducted by FINRA suggest that there is
considerable variation in firms’ willingness to share information about cybersecurity threats
voluntarily, with larger firms being more likely to do so.122 Other surveys paint a similar picture;
a recent survey of financial firms found that while recognition of the value of information-

cybersecurity measures being employed by registrants are not generally observable. Consequently, it is not
practicable to estimate the adequacy of measures currently being employed by registrants.
117 The Commission does not currently collect data from registrants regarding the presence of such
arrangements. We are also not aware of any third-party data providers that tabulate this information.

advisers and funds.
sharing arrangements is widespread, a majority of firms report hesitance to participate due to
regulatory restrictions or privacy concerns.123
2. Regulation
As discussed in greater detail in section I.B above, although existing rules and regulations
do not impose explicit cybersecurity requirements on advisers and funds, advisers’ duties as
fiduciaries, as well as several existing rules and regulations applicable to advisers and funds
indirectly implicate cybersecurity. As fiduciaries, advisers are required to act in the best interest
of their clients at all times.124 This fiduciary obligation includes taking steps to minimize
cybersecurity risks that could lead to significant business disruptions or a loss or misuse of client
data.125 Additionally, the Advisers Act compliance rule requires advisers to consider their
fiduciary and regulatory obligations and formulate policies and procedures to address them.126
While the Advisers Act compliance rule does not enumerate specific cybersecurity elements that
an adviser must include in its compliance program,
127 the Commission has previously stated that
advisers should consider factors creating risk exposure for the firm and its clients and design
policies and procedures that address those risks.128 As the potential for a cybersecurity incident
to create significant operational disruptions is well understood at this point, we understand that
larger advisers with significant IT infrastructures are assessing cybersecurity risks when
developing their compliance policies and procedures.129
 123 See Reshaping the Cybersecurity Landscape, supra footnote 107 . Survey respondents consisted of CISOs
(or equivalent) of 53 members of the FS-ISAC. Of the respondents, twenty-four reported being in the
retail/corporate banking sector, twenty reported being in the consumer/financial services (non-banking)
sector, and seventeen reported being in the insurance sector. Other respondents included IT service
providers, financial utilities, trade associations, and credit unions. Some respondents reported being in
multiple sectors.
124 See supra footnote 9.
125 See supra section I.B (discussing fiduciary obligations).
126 See supra section I.B (discussing Advisers Act compliance rule).
127 According to the rule, an adviser should identify conflicts of interest and other compliance factors creating
risk exposure for the firm and its clients in light of the firm’s particular operations. See supra footnote 10
and accompanying text.
128 See Compliance Program Release, supra footnote 10, at n.22 and accompanying text.
129 See, e.g., Chuck Seets, Jamie Smith, and Steve Klemash, What Companies Are Disclosing About
One potential risk for an adviser’s client stemming from the cybersecurity threats faced
by the adviser, is that a cybersecurity incident at the adviser could lead to the client’s
information130 being compromised or the loss of the client’s assets. Nominally, the risk of
outright loss should be limited for assets subject to 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2 (the “Custody
Rule”),
131 which are—by effect of said rule—generally held by “qualified custodians.”
Qualified custodians are typically large financial institutions.
132 Such financial institutions
generally enjoy significant economies of scale, have large franchise (and reputation) values, and
are subject to numerous additional regulatory requirements.133 For these reasons, cybersecurity
protections provided by qualified custodians may be well-developed, and could help mitigate the
risk of outright loss of client funds and securities in advisers’ custody.134
Although protection provided by qualified custodians can mitigate risk to certain client
assets to some extent, they cannot replace cybersecurity hygiene at the adviser level. As an
adviser’s “custody” of client assets implies a degree of control over those assets, compromise of
adviser’s systems—or the adviser’s service providers’ systems—could lead to unauthorized
actions being taken with respect to those assets—including assets maintained with qualified

merchant, or certain foreign financial institutions. The qualified custodian maintains client’s funds and
securities in a separate account for each client. Alternatively, the adviser’s clients’ funds and securities can
be held in an account under the adviser’s name as agent or trustee for the clients.

custodians. Moreover, as observed by Commission staff, advisers may fail to realize that they
have “custody” of client funds and securities, and may not place these assets with a qualified
custodian.
135 Such problems can occur when, for example, an adviser holds login credentials to
clients’ accounts or when the adviser or a related person of the adviser serves as trustee of, or has
been granted power of attorney for, client accounts.136
The Investment Company Act compliance rule requires a fund to adopt and implement
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Federal
securities laws by the fund and named service providers.137 We believe that operating a fund
today generally requires considerable IT sophistication, especially in the case of open-end
funds.138 Therefore, we believe that all but the smallest funds likely take into account
cybersecurity risks when developing their compliance policies and procedures under the
Investment Company Act compliance rule.
A number of other Commission rules also implicate cybersecurity. Regulation S-P
requires advisers and funds to adopt written policies and procedures that address protection of
customer records and information, which likely would include reasonably designed cybersecurity
policies and procedures.139 In addition, advisers and funds subject to Regulation S-ID must

137 17 CFR 270.38a-1. The Investment Company Act compliance rule also requires the fund to: (1) designate

providing the fund’s board with an annual report; and (2) review the adequacy of the policies and
procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation at least annually.

140 Compliance with one or both of the aforementioned
requirements requires certain reasonably designed cybersecurity policies and procedures to be in
place.141
Some affected registrants may also be subject to other regulators’ rules implicating
cybersecurity. We understand that private funds may be subject to the Federal Trade
Commission’s recently amended 16 CFR 314.1 through 16 CFR 314.5 (Standards for
Safeguarding Customer Information (“FTC Safeguards Rule”)) that contains a number of
modifications to the existing rule with respect to data security requirements to protect customer
financial information.
142 To the extent that a private fund subject to the FTC Safeguards Rule is
managed by an adviser that is registered with the Commission, our proposed rule would result in
some overlapping regulatory requirements.143 As recently amended, the FTC Safeguards Rule
generally requires financial institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive
information security program that consists of the administrative, technical, and physical
safeguards the financial institution uses to access, collect, distribute, process, protect, store, use,
transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle customer information.144 The key provision of the rule
is the requirement to design and implement a comprehensive information security program with
 140 See Identity Theft Release, supra footnote 16 .
141 The scope of the Regulation S-ID differs from Regulation S-P. Regulation S-P applies to the protection of
customer records and information by advisers and funds, whereas Regulation S-ID applies to funds and
advisers that meet the definition of “financial institution” or “creditor” that offers or maintains “covered
accounts.” See Regulation S-P Release, supra footnote 14 ; see also Identity Theft Release, supra footnote
16 ().

number of detailed measures must generally be adopted by December 9, 2022. Id.

145 It also requires written periodic risk assessments, and that the safeguards’
be designed so as to address risks identified through such assessments.146 In addition, it requires
financial institutions to take reasonable steps to select and retain service providers capable of
maintaining appropriate safeguards for customer information and require those service providers
by contract to implement and maintain such safeguards.147 Although narrower in scope than the
rules being proposed here148 and generally more prescriptive,

provisions are congruent with the requirements for cybersecurity policies and procedures,

not currently include disclosure, regulatory reporting, or recordkeeping requirements.153
3. Market Structure
Advisers that would be subject to the proposed rules provide a variety of services to their
clients, including: financial planning advice, portfolio management, pension consulting, selecting
other advisers, publication of periodicals and newsletters, security rating and pricing, market
timing, and educational seminars.154 Although advisers can expose clients to cybersecurity
 145 16 CFR 314.4(c), (d), and (h). These “safeguard” elements of the FTC rule are effectively more
prescriptive versions of the User Security and Access, Information Protection, and Cybersecurity Incident
Response and Recovery elements being proposed here. See supra sections II.A.1.b, II.A.1.c, and II.A.1.e.
146 16 CFR 314.4(b), (c). These elements of the FTC rule are analogous to the Risk Assessment and Threat
and Vulnerability Management elements being proposed here. See supra sections II.A.1.a and II.A.1.d.
147 16 CFR 314.4(d). Similar to the rules being proposed here, the FTC Safeguards Rule requires oversight of
third-party service providers. See proposed rules 38a-2(a)(3)(ii) and 206(4)-9(a)(3)(ii).
148 The scope of the FTC Safeguards Rule is limited to protecting customer information. 16 CFR 314.3(a).
149 The FTC Safeguards Rule imposes various technical requirements such as the use of encryption and multifactor authentication. 16 CFR 314.4(c)(3) and (c)(5).

152 See proposed rule 38a-2(c) and 16 CFR 314.4(i); see also supra section II.A.3.
153 The FTC, however, issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comment on further
amending the Safeguards Rule to require regulatory reporting of certain security events. See FTC,
Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information (Oct. 27, 2021) [86 FR 70062 (Dec. 9, 2021)].
154 See Form ADV.
threats through any of these activities, the potential for harm can vary widely across advisers. A
cybersecurity breach at an adviser that only offers advice on wealth allocation strategies may not
have a significant negative effect on its clients: such adviser may not hold much client
information beyond address, payment details, and the client’s overall financial condition. On the
other hand, a breach at an adviser that performs portfolio management services exposes clients to
much greater risk: such an adviser will not only hold client personally identifiable information
and records, but also typically have some degree of control over client assets. In addition, even a
brief disruption to the services offered by advisers performing portfolio management services
(e.g., a ransomware attack) could have large negative repercussions on the adviser’s clients (e.g.,
inability to access funds and securities).
Based on Form ADV filings up to October 31, 2021, there were 14,774 advisers with a
total of $113 trillion in assets under management.155 Practically all (97%) of the advisers
reported providing portfolio management services to their clients.156 Over half (55%) reported
having custody157 of clients’ cash or securities either directly or through a related person with
client funds in custody totaling $39 trillion.158
 155 Broadly, regulatory assets under management is the current value of assets in securities portfolios for which
the adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services. See Form ADV, Item 5F.
156 Form ADV, Items 5G(2-5) (as of Oct. 4, 2021).
157 Here, “custody” means “holding, directly or indirectly, client funds or securities, or having any authority to
obtain possession of them.” An adviser also has “custody” if “a related person holds, directly or indirectly,
client funds or securities, or has any authority to obtain possession of them, in connection with advisory
services [the adviser] provide[s] to clients.” See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-2(d)(2).

Figure 1 plots the distribution of client assets for which advisers have custody as defined
in rule 206(4)-2. The distribution is highly skewed: four advisers have custody over more than
$1 trillion, while half of advisers have custody over less than $10 million. Approximately two
thirds of advisers have custody of over $100 million. Many such advisers are quite small, with
half reporting fewer than 15 employees.159 Nearly all (97%) advisers rely on an unrelated person
to act as a qualified custodian for customer assets.160 The qualified custodian industry is
dominated by a small number of large U.S. entities.161

The funds that would be directly subject to the proposed rules include open-end funds,
registered closed-end funds, business development companies, and unit investment trusts.

Table 1 presents the breakdown of funds registered with the Commission in 2020. In 2020, there
were 15,750 registered funds, with over $25 trillion in net assets.
163 The vast majority of the
registered funds (13,248) are open-end funds. Many of the funds (82%) are part of a fund
family. There are 290 such fund families. As shown in Figure 2, fund families exhibit
considerable variation in size: some families consist of hundreds of funds, while others consist of
just a handful of funds, with the median family consisting of 10 funds. The larger-than-median
families represented the majority (10,389) of funds, and nearly all ($23 trillion) industry NAV.164

Although private funds would not be directly subject to the proposed rules, they would be
indirectly affected through the proposed provisions on advisers. Approximately one third of
advisers (5,231) report advising private funds.165 Private funds have grown dramatically over
the past decade. As plotted in Figure 3, advisers’ reported assets under management of private
funds more than doubled from $8 trillion to $17 trillion, while the reported number of private
funds grew from 24 thousand to 44 thousand.166

D. Benefits and Costs of the Proposed Rule and Form Amendments
The proposed rules would impose four types of new requirements on advisers and funds:
(1) cybersecurity policies and procedures; (2) cybersecurity disclosures; (3) regulatory reporting
of cybersecurity incidents; and (4) recordkeeping of cybersecurity incidents. The new
requirements would be substantially similar for both advisers and funds. In this section, we
consider the benefits and costs of each of these in turn.
167
1. Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures
The Commission’s proposed risk management rules168 would require all advisers and
funds registered with the Commission to implement reasonably designed cybersecurity policies
and procedures addressing key elements of cybersecurity preparedness: (1) risk assessment,
including assessment of risks associated with certain service providers, oversight of such

efficiency, competition, and capital formation. We summarize these effects in section III.E.

169 Advisers and funds would need to review these
policies and procedures at least annually and to prepare a written report of the review’s findings;
for funds the policies and reviews would be subject to board oversight.
170
As discussed in section III.C.2, it can be argued that the fiduciary obligations of advisers,
existing rules applicable to advisers and funds, the modern technological context, and commonly
employed best practices that forms the baseline, may require funds and advisers to implement
reasonably designed cybersecurity policies and procedures.171 However, as noted earlier,
Commission staff has observed that some funds and advisers practices in the cybersecurity area
raise concerns, and there is reason172 and evidence173 to suggest that underinvestment in
cybersecurity may be a fairly widespread problem.
a. Benefits
We believe that the Commission’s proposed risk management rules would, by imposing
comprehensive, explicit requirements to address key elements of cybersecurity preparedness,
generally improve the cybersecurity policies and procedures of advisers and funds, and in so
doing reduce registrants’—and hence their clients’ and investors’—exposure to cybersecurity
incidents, as well as reduce the costs incurred by registrants (and their clients and investors) in
dealing with such incidents.
 169 See supra section II.A.1 (discussing elements of proposed cybersecurity policies and procedures).
170 In the case of funds, the initial cybersecurity policies and procedures would need to be approved by the
fund’s board, including a majority of its independent directors; the board would also be provided annual
written reports detailing the findings of the reviews. See supra sections II.A.2 and II.A.3 (discussing
annual written reports and fund board oversight).
171 See supra section III.C.2 (discussing existing rules).
172 See supra section III.C.1.
173 See IIF/McKinsey Report, supra footnote 95 .
Because unaddressed cybersecurity risks impose externalities on the broader financial
system, the proposed risk management rules would also likely reduce systemic risk in the
economy.
174 In addition, we expect that by imposing explicit cybersecurity requirements on
registrants, the proposed rules would enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee and enforce
rules designed to protect client and investor information and assets.
Registrants that have already implemented cybersecurity policies and procedures that
adhere to best practices and are consistent with the proposed rules are not expected to undertake
material changes to their existing policies and procedures, in which instance the proposed rules
would have limited added benefits. Conversely, registrants who do not currently have
cybersecurity policies and procedures or have policies and procedures that lack one or more of
the enumerated elements, such as those that are not reasonably designed or not reviewed on an
annual basis would need to improve their policies and procedures to comply with the proposed
rules with attendant benefits to registrants, investors, the broader financial system, and
regulators. As we do not currently have reliable data on the extent to which registrants’ existing
policies and procedures follow industry best practices, address cybersecurity risks, their
“reasonableness,” or the frequency at which they are reviewed, it is not possible for us to
quantify the scale of the benefits arising from the proposed requirements.
175
b. Costs
We believe that the costs associated with the proposed amendments related to
cybersecurity policies and procedures would primarily result from compliance costs borne by
advisers and funds in the adoption and implementation of “reasonably designed” cybersecurity
policies. In addition to the aforementioned direct compliance costs faced by registrants, the
 174 See supra footnote 97 and accompanying text.
175 Generally, quantification in areas that involve “reasonableness” criteria is difficult as establishing
reasonableness requires case-by-case consideration.
proposed requirements would likely impose indirect costs to service providers catering to
advisers and funds. Under the proposal, the cybersecurity practices of these service providers
would need to be evaluated by advisers and funds subject to the proposed amendments to help
ensure that service providers implement and maintain cybersecurity measures that address the
required elements of the policies and procedures provisions of this proposal.
176 Some of the cost
of such evaluations, as well as the costs of resulting remedial actions may fall on service
providers. Moreover, because the proposal requires registrants to include contractual provisions
in its agreements with service providers to guarantee adherence to the required measures, the
costs associated with negotiating such contractual provisions may also be partly borne by service
providers.177 Ultimately, all these costs may be passed on—in whole or in part—to clients and
investors.
As discussed above, we believe that advisers and funds that currently follow
cybersecurity best practices will likely find that their existing policies and procedures are largely
consistent with the requirement of this proposal and as such, would not need to be materially
altered. Similarly, we believe that advisers of private funds subject to the FTC Safeguards Rule
will have already developed policies and procedures consistent with the requirements of the
current proposal.178 Consequently, for such registrants, the compliance costs associated with the
proposed policies and procedures requirements would likely be minimal.
179 Conversely,
registrants who currently do not have policies and procedures in place meeting the proposed
requirement would bear compliance costs related to improving them. In the extreme, we expect
that registrants with no current cybersecurity policies and procedures would have to bear
substantial costs. Typical estimates of cybersecurity spending in the financial industry are on the
 176 See proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(3)(ii) and 38a-2(a)(3)(ii).
177 Id.
178 See supra section III.C.2.
179 We separately consider direct costs associated with information collection burdens within the meaning of
the Paperwork Reduction Act in section IV. See also supra footnote 86.
order of 0.5% of revenue;
180 assuming that levels of spending of this order are required to obtain
“reasonably designed” policies and procedures, registrants who have no such policies would
need to bear costs of that order. Of course, as discussed above, it is unlikely that a fund or
adviser operating today completely lacks cybersecurity policies and procedures. Here, the same
issues that make quantifying the benefits impracticable also render quantification of compliance
costs impracticable.
181 However, as discussed in section III.C.1 we believe that existing adviser
and fund rules require certain cybersecurity practices to be substantially in place; consequently,
the largest compliance costs resulting from the proposed policies and procedures requirement are
likely to be borne by registrants not currently following industry noted best practices.
182 We also
anticipate that the bulk of any compliance costs associated with developing and implementing
policies and procedures would be incurred at the level of an advisory firm (or parent firm) and
fund family, rather than by each adviser and fund individually.183
The proposed provisions require registrants to consider the cybersecurity risks resulting
from their reliance on third-party service providers that receive, maintain, or process adviser or
fund information, or are otherwise permitted to access their information systems and any
information residing therein.
184 Thus, the proposed requirements would affect a broad range of
service providers: not only entities such as custodians, brokers, and valuation services, but also
email providers, customer relationship management systems, cloud applications, and other
technology vendors that meet this criterion. Registrants would be required to document that such
service providers implement and maintain appropriate measures to protect information of clients
and investors and the systems hosting said information, pursuant to a written contract between
 180 See supra footnote 107.
181 As noted earlier, we do not currently have reliable data on the extent to which registrants address
cybersecurity risks, their “reasonableness,” or the frequency at which they are evaluated.
182 See supra section III.C.2.
183 See supra section III.C.3 (noting that 82% of funds belong to 290 fund families).
184 See proposed rules 206(4)-9 and 38a-2.
the registrant and its service provider.
185 As a result, practically all service providers providing
business-critical services would face market pressure to (and thus bear costs related to) document
and, in some cases, enhance their cybersecurity practices so as to satisfy affected registrants’
requirements.186 Some funds and advisers may find that one or several of their existing service
providers may not be able to—or wish to—support compliance with the proposed rule.
Similarly, some funds and advisers may find that one or several of their existing service
providers may not be able to—or wish to—enter into suitable written contracts. In these cases,
the fund or adviser would need to switch service providers and bear the associated switching
costs, while the service providers would suffer loss of their fund and adviser customers.187 In
other cases, a fund or adviser may determine that a service provider can be used subject to
renegotiation of service agreements, potentially imposing substantial contracting costs on the
parties.188
We expect that for service providers that offer specialized services to the adviser and
fund industry, the proposed rule amendments would impose additional costs related to
remediating and/or documenting the provider’s cybersecurity practices so as to satisfy advisers
and funds subject to the proposed amendments. These costs may be passed on to advisers and
funds and ultimately to clients and investors. However, we do not generally expect these costs to
be large, as we believe that the nature of service provider business models and resulting
economies of scale give service providers motivation for and advantages in the development of
 185 See supra section II.A.1.c.
186 We note that a service provider involved in any business-critical function would likely need to receive,
maintain, or process either adviser or fund information.
187 If for example the fund or adviser has insufficient market power to affect changes in the service provider’s
cybersecurity policies. This is most likely to occur with smaller advisers and funds employing generic
service providers who do not specialize in providing services to funds or advisers.
188 These costs include the direct costs associated with reviewing and renegotiating existing agreements as
well as indirect costs arising from service providers requiring additional compensation for providing the
required contractual provisions.
robust cybersecurity measures and that such measures would generally address the elements
required in this proposal.
189
Providers of more generic services (e.g., customer relationship management systems,
cloud storage, or email systems) may also bear some costs related to satisfying requests from
large funds and advisers attempting to assess service providers’ cybersecurity risk. For example,
such providers may be asked to provide additional documentation of their cybersecurity
practices, to offer additional guarantees, or to change some aspect of their practices during
contract negotiations. Even if satisfying the intent of these additional customer requirements
would not represent a significant expense for service providers, contracting frictions are likely to
prevent some service providers from doing so.190 In such cases, registrants would bear costs
related to finding alternative service providers while existing service providers would suffer lost
revenue.191
The aforementioned costs would be particularly acute for smaller advisers and funds that
rely on generic service providers. Smaller registrants may not have sufficient bargaining power
with service providers of more generic services to effect meaningful changes in cybersecurity
practices or contractual provisions.192 Thus, to the extent that the existing cybersecurity
practices of generic service providers cannot be reconciled with the proposed requirements, some
advisers and funds may be forced to switch providers and bear the associated switching costs; at
the same time, the former service providers would suffer loss of revenue from these customers.
2. Disclosures of Cybersecurity Risks and Incidents
 189 For such service providers, the delivery of services via communication networks is often at the core of the
business, practically necessitating reasonably designed cybersecurity policies. Moreover, such service
providers generally deliver their products (or some customizations thereof) to multiple customers, resulting
in economies of scale in the development of cybersecurity measures.
190 For example, the costs associated with legal review of alterations to standard contracts may not be worth
bearing if affected registrants represent a small segment of the service provider’s business.
191 At the same time, these frictions would benefit service providers that cater to customers in regulated
industries.
192 For example, it is highly unlikely that a small investment adviser would be able to effect any changes in its
contracts with providers of generic services such as Amazon or Google.
Proposed amendments to part 2A for Form ADV and proposed amendments to fund
registration statements would require a narrative description of the cybersecurity risks advisers’
face, how they assess, prioritize, and address cybersecurity risks and any significant adviser or
fund cybersecurity incidents that had occurred in the past two years.193 Under the proposed
amendments, significant cybersecurity incidents would need to be disclosed either by filing an
amendment to Form ADV promptly (in the case of advisers) or by amending a prospectus by
filing a supplement with the Commission (in the case of funds).194 For fund registration
statements, the proposed amendments would require the disclosures to be submitted using the
Inline XBRL structured data language.195
a. Benefits
As discussed in section III.B there exists an information asymmetry between clients and
investors vis-à-vis advisers and funds. This information asymmetry, together with limitations to
private contracting,
196 inhibits clients’ and investors’ ability to screen and discipline advisers and
funds based on the effectiveness of their cybersecurity policies. In principle, the proposed
disclosure requirements would help alleviate this information asymmetry, and in so doing enable
clients and investors to better assess the effectiveness of advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity
preparations and the cybersecurity risks of different advisers and funds. For example, clients and
investors could use the frequency or nature of significant cybersecurity incidents—as disclosed
under the proposed amendments—to infer an adviser’s or fund’s effort toward preventing
cyberattacks. Likewise, clients and investors could use the narrative descriptions of
cybersecurity incident handling procedures to avoid advisers and funds with less well-developed
procedures.
 193 See supra section II.C.
194 See proposed rule 204-3; see also supra footnotes 80 and 81 and accompanying text.
195 See supra section II.C.4.
196 See Tirole, supra footnote 94.
The scale of an information asymmetry mitigation benefit would depend on the degree to
which the proposed disclosures reveal information useful to clients and investors about risks and
on their ability to use it to infer the level of cybersecurity preparations implemented by advisers
and funds. Even when cybersecurity preparations are high, a cybersecurity attack may
succeed.
197 If some types of reportable cybersecurity incidents are largely the result of chance
while other types are a result of insufficient cybersecurity preparation, the client or investor
would need to be able to differentiate between the two types of incidents to extract useful
information about a fund’s or adviser’s level of cybersecurity preparations.198 Many clients and
investors are unlikely to be experts on cybersecurity, and their ability to make these distinctions
could be limited.
199
To the extent such information asymmetry reduction effects result from the proposed
cybersecurity incident disclosures in fund registration statements, an Inline XBRL requirement
would likely augment those effects by making the proposed disclosures more easily retrievable
and usable for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis.
200 As a point of
comparison, XBRL requirements for public operating company financial statement disclosures
 197 Although “adequate” cybersecurity preparations can be expected to reduce cybersecurity incidents, they are
unlikely to eliminate them entirely. For example, a firm may suffer a cybersecurity breach due to an
attacker discovering a “zero-day exploit” (i.e., an exploit that is not generally known to exist) in some
underlying IT system. As a practical matter, even the best preparation (e.g., keeping up to date with vendor
patches, quickly addressing vulnerabilities, etc.) may not be effective against such exploits. Similarly, for
many firms, it may not be feasible to fix a known vulnerability immediately (e.g., weakness in an
encryption algorithm) as the fix may require upgrades to numerous systems. In this case, many firms could
be exposed to a vulnerability for some time. Because the time it takes for an attacker to exploit such a
vulnerability successfully is likely to involve some element of chance, firms that ultimately suffer an
incident resulting from such a vulnerability may simply be “unlucky.”
198 For example, incidents resulting from advanced persistent threats may be unavoidable, or avoidable only
through very high level of effort. See supra footnote 100. On the other hand, incidents arising from brute
force password attacks can be avoided with minimal effort. Observers unable to differentiate between
these two types of incidents would have difficulty drawing correct inference about the relative effort of
different incident reporters.
199 They may however rely on experts for such assessments.
200 The proposed Inline XBRL requirement would apply to cybersecurity risks and incidents disclosures in
fund registration statements on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6. See supra section
II.C.4. Advisers would not be required to tag the proposed Form ADV disclosures in Inline XBRL. See
supra section II.C.1.
have been observed to mitigate information asymmetry by reducing information processing
costs, thereby making the disclosures easier to access and analyze.201 This reduction in
information processing cost has been observed to facilitate the monitoring of companies by
external parties, and, as a result, to influence companies’ behavior, including their disclosure
choices.202
While these observations are specific to operating company financial statement
disclosures, and not to disclosures from funds that are outside the financial statements, such as
the proposed cybersecurity incident disclosures, they indicate that the proposed Inline XBRL
requirements could directly or indirectly (i.e., through information intermediaries such as
financial media, data aggregators, and academic researchers), provide fund investors with
increased insight into cybersecurity-related incidents at specific funds and across funds, fund
managers, and time periods.
203 Also, in contrast to XBRL financial statements (including

playing field between insiders and non-insiders, in line with the hypothesis that “the adoption of XBRL
enhances the processing of financial information by investors and hence reduces information asymmetry”).

Costs and Corporate Tax Avoidance: Evidence from the SEC’s XBRL Mandate, 40 Journal of Accounting
and Public Policy 2 (Mar.-Apr. 2021) (finding XBRL reporting decreases likelihood of firm tax avoidance

dampens managerial incentives to engage in tax avoidance behavior”); Paul A. Griffin, Hyun A Hong,

costs,” and “both regulatory and non-regulatory market participants play a role in monitoring firm
disclosures,” suggesting that the “processing costs of market participants can be significant enough to
impact firms’ disclosure decisions”).
203 See, e.g., Nina Trentmann, Companies Adjust Earnings for Covid-19 Costs, but Are They Still a One-Time
Expense? The Wall Street Journal (Sept. 4, 2020) (citing an XBRL research software provider as a source
for the analysis described in the article); Bloomberg Lists BSE XBRL Data, XBRL.org (Mar. 17, 2019);

Accounting Review 259–287 (2018).
footnotes), which consist of tagged quantitative and narrative disclosures, the proposed incident
disclosures would consist largely of tagged narrative disclosures.204 Tagging narrative
disclosures can facilitate analytical benefits such as automatic comparison/redlining of these
disclosures against prior periods and the performance of targeted artificial intelligence/machine
learning assessments (tonality, sentiment, risk words, etc.) of specific cybersecurity disclosures
rather than the entire unstructured document.205
The markets for advisory services and funds present clients and investors with a complex,
multi-dimensional, choice problem. In choosing an adviser or fund, clients and investors may
consider investment strategy, ratings or commentaries, return histories, fee structures, risk
exposures, reputations, etc. While we are not aware of any studies that examine the role
perceptions of cybersecurity play in this choice problem, the extant academic literature suggests
that investors focus on salient, attention-grabbing information such as past performance and
commissions when making such choices.206 Moreover, to the extent that cybersecurity
disclosures are “boilerplate” they may be less informative.
207 Conversely, cybersecurity
incidents—especially those that involve loss of customer data or assets—are likely to garner
attention. Thus, we expect that the proposed requirement to disclose significant cybersecurity
incidents would have more of a direct effect on clients’ and investors’ choices. In addition, third
parties such as rating services, journalists, or “adviser advisers”208—who may be more capable
 204 The proposed fund disclosure requirements do not expressly require the disclosure of any quantitative
values in the discussion of cybersecurity incidents; if a fund includes any quantitative values as nested
within the required discussion (e.g., disclosing the number of days until containment), those values would
be individually detail tagged, in addition to the block text tagging of the narrative disclosures.
205 To illustrate, using the search term “remediation” to search through the text of all fund registration
statements over a certain period of time, so as to analyze the trends in funds’ disclosures related to
cybersecurity incident remediation efforts during that period, could return many narrative disclosures
outside of the cybersecurity incident discussion (e.g., disclosures related to potential environmental
liabilities in the risk factors section).
206 See, e.g., Brad M. Barber, Terrance Odean, and Lu Zheng, Out of Sight, Out of Mind: The Effects of
Expenses on Mutual Fund Flows, 78 (6) The Journal of Business 2095 - 2120 (2005).
207 However, the process of adopting “boilerplate” language by advisers and funds may itself affect
improvements in policies and procedures.
208 “Adviser advisers” are advisers who assist clients in selecting other advisers to manage some subset of the
of extracting useful information out of the proposed disclosures—may incorporate it in
assessments ultimately provided to clients and investors. Whether directly or indirectly,
registrants with subpar cybersecurity policies and procedures—as revealed by “excess”
cybersecurity incidents—could face pressure to improve said policies to reduce such excess
incidents. Similarly, with respect to the proposed disclosures of cybersecurity incident handling
procedures, funds and advisers that disclose having substandard procedures could face market
pressure to improve the quality of their cybersecurity incident handling procedures.209
The proposed incident disclosure requirement should also benefit the current clients and
investors of advisers and funds that experience a cybersecurity incident by providing notice that
personal information, assets, or funds may have been compromised. Based on the notice, the
clients and investors could take timely remedial actions such as auditing financial statements,
blocking accounts that may have been compromised, or monitoring account activity.
b. Costs
Because reasonably designed cybersecurity policies and procedures would—in practice—
require the collection of information that make up the proposed disclosures, we do not believe
that the disclosure requirement itself would impose significant compliance costs beyond those
already discussed.210 However, these disclosures may impose costs due to market reactions, and
due to the information they reveal to cybercriminals.
Funds and advisers that report many cybersecurity incidents and—to a lesser extent—
those who report less well-developed cybersecurity incident handling procedures may bear costs

client’s portfolio.
209 Here we are assuming that clients, investors, or third parties evaluating advisers and funds would favor
advisers and funds that include standard language relating to cybersecurity procedures in their disclosures.
Further, we assume that registrants with “superior” procedures could adopt standard disclosures with no
cost; conversely registrants with “substandard” procedures would need to affect improvements in their
procedures to be able to furnish the standard disclosure.
210 See supra section III.D.1. Administrative costs related to disclosure, including costs associated with legal
reviews of such disclosures and costs attendant to tagging an additional section of a fund registration
statement that is already subject to Inline XBRL requirements, are covered in the Paperwork Reduction Act
analysis in section IV. See also supra footnote 86.
arising from reactions in the marketplace: they may lose business or suffer harm to their
reputations and brand values.
211 These costs would likely be borne not only by advisers and
funds with inadequate cybersecurity policies, but also those who experience cybersecurity
incidents despite having made reasonable efforts to prevent them. In addition, to the extent that
clients and investors “overreact”212 to disclosures of cybersecurity breaches, advisers and funds
may pursue a strategy of “overinvestment” in cybersecurity precautions (to avoid such
overreactions) resulting in reduced efficiency.
Mandating disclosure about cybersecurity incidents entails a tradeoff. While disclosure
can inform clients and investors, disclosure can also inform cyber attackers that they have been
detected. Also, disclosing too much (e.g., the types of systems that were affected, how they were
compromised) could be used by cybercriminals to better target their attacks, imposing costs on
registrants. For example, announcing a cybersecurity incident naming a specific piece of
malware and the degree of compromise can imply a trove of details about the structure of the
victim’s computer systems, the security measures employed (or not employed), and potentially
suggest promising attack vectors for future attacks by other would-be attackers. Under the
proposed amendments, registrants would be required to disclose cybersecurity incidents through
filing of amendments to From ADV or registration statements in a timely manner.213 In so
doing, the registrants would need to identify the entity or entities affected, when the incidents
were discovered and whether they are ongoing, whether any data was stolen, altered, or accessed
or used for any other unauthorized purpose, the effect of the incident on the adviser’s operations,
and whether the adviser or service provider has remediated or is currently remediating the
 211 We expect that clients and investors will be more likely to act in response to realized cybersecurity
incidents than in response to advisers and funds descriptions of their policies and procedures.
212 Such overreactions can be the result of overconfidence about the precision of the signal. See, e.g., Kent
Daniel, David Hirshleifer, and Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, Investor Psychology and Security Market
Under- and Overreactions, 53 (6) The Journal of Finance 1839–85 (Dec. 1998).
213 See supra section II.C.
incident.
214 Thus, registrants would generally not be required to disclose technical details about
incidents that could compromise their cybersecurity going forward. As before, the costs
associated with conveying this information to attackers is impracticable to estimate.215
In addition, for one type of registrant—unit investment trusts—the requirement to tag the
cybersecurity incident disclosures in Inline XBRL would create additional compliance costs.
Unlike the other funds subject to the proposed cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements,
unit investment trusts that register on Form N-8B-2 and file post-effective amendments on Form
S-6 are not currently subject to Inline XBRL requirements.216 As such, for these unit investment
trusts, the proposed Inline XBRL requirement would entail compliance costs beyond the
marginal administrative costs associated with tagging an additional section of a filing that is
already partially tagged.
217 For example, these unit investment trusts could incur implementation
costs associated with licensing Inline XBRL compliance software and training staff to use the
software to tag the cybersecurity incident disclosures. To the extent a unit investment trust
outsources its tagging to a third-party service provider, any costs that such a service provider
would incur in developing the capability to tag unit investment trust filings could be passed on to
the unit investment trust. Given the improvements in technology and the increased familiarity
with XBRL tagging at advisers and service providers since fund XBRL requirements were first
adopted in 2009, we expect these costs would be diminished relative to the compliance costs that
funds incurred at the time of initial XBRL adoption.218
 214 Id.
215 As noted in the Broad Economic Considerations section (supra section III.B), firms are generally hesitant
to provide information about cyberattacks. Similarly, cybercriminals are not generally forthcoming with
data on attacks, their success, or factors that made the attacks possible. Consequently, data from which
plausible estimates could be made is not available.
216 See supra footnote 83.
217 Such administrative costs are covered in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV.
218 As a point of comparison, an AICPA survey of small reporting companies found a 45% decline in the
average annual cost and a 69% decline in the median annual cost of fully outsourced XBRL tagging
services from 2014 to 2017. See Michael Cohn, AICPA Sees 45% Drop in XBRL Costs for Small
Companies, Acct. Today, (Aug. 15, 2018), available at https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/aicpa-sees45-drop-in-xbrl-costs-for-small-reporting-companies.
3. Regulatory Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents
Under the proposed rules, advisers would be required to report significant cybersecurity
incidents to the Commission within 48 hours.219 The reporting requirement would extend to
significant cybersecurity incidents at an adviser’s “covered client”—a client that is a registered
investment company or business development company, or a private fund.
220 Cybersecurity
incident reports would be submitted on proposed new Form ADV-C, and amended when
information reported previously becomes materially inaccurate or if new material information is
discovered.221 Under the proposed rules, significant cybersecurity incidents are those that
significantly affect the critical operations of an adviser or fund or lead to unauthorized access or
use of information that results in substantial harm to the adviser or its clients or a fund or its
investors.
222 Form ADV-C reports would be treated as confidential by the Commission.223
a. Benefits
Confidential, regulatory reporting of significant cybersecurity incidents would allow the
Commission staff to assess trends, identify emerging risks in cybersecurity, and facilitate
information sharing among advisers and funds. It would also allow the Commission to better
coordinate a response to cybersecurity incidents which have the potential to cause broader
disruptions to the financial markets, undermine financial stability, and contribute to systemic
risk.
As discussed in section III.B, advisers and funds have incentives to not disclose
information about cybersecurity incidents. Such incentives reduce the information available
about cybersecurity threats and thereby inhibit the efficacy of collective (i.e., an industry’s or a
 219 See proposed rule 204-6; see also supra section II.B.
220 Id.; see also proposed rule 38a-2.
221 See proposed rule 204-6; see also supra section II.B.
222 See proposed rule 204-6(b); see also proposed rule 206(4)-9.
223 See supra section II.B.
society’s) cybersecurity measures.224 At the same time, complete transparency in this area likely
runs the risk of facilitating future attacks.
225 As discussed in section III.C.1, the challenge of
effective information sharing has long been recognized, and government efforts at encouraging
such sharing on a voluntary basis have had only limited success.226 The proposed reporting
requirement, by channeling incident reports through the Commission, would create the
opportunity for sharing of information valuable in preventing future cyberattacks, while
preserving confidentiality and limiting the cybersecurity risks of public disclosure. For example,
a series of reports detailing the compromise of a system commonly employed by small advisers
could result in the Commission issuing a notice to similar advisers of the risks of the particular
system. On the other hand, a general uptick in “phishing” style attacks using particular language
and originating from similar addresses could lead the Commission to issue a risk alert to all
registrants. Of course, in some cases, it may not be possible for the Commission to disclose any
information discovered from a report without violating the confidentiality of the reporting entity
or without exacerbating cybersecurity risks for some entities.
227 In such cases, the Commission
may still be able to share information with relevant law enforcement or national security
agencies.
In addition to facilitating information sharing, the proposed reporting requirements could
also allow the Commission to coordinate market-wide responses to cybersecurity incidents. For
 224 See, e.g., Denise E. Zheng and James A. Lewis, Cyber Threat Information Sharing, Center for Strategic and
International Studies (Mar. 2015), available at https://www.csis.org/analysis/cyber-threat-informationsharing (recommending that regulators encourage information sharing).
225 Although “security through obscurity” as a cybersecurity philosophy has long been derided, “obscurity,” or
more generally “deception,” has been recognized as an important cyber resilience technique. See Ross,
Ron, Victoria Pillitteri, Richard Graubart, Deborah Bodeau, and Rosalie McQuaid, Developing Cyber
Resilient Systems: A Systems Security Engineering Approach, National Institute of Standards and
Technology (Dec. 2021), available at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v2r1. See also supra
section III.D.2 (discussion of costs associated with disclosure).
226 See supra section III.C.1 (discussion of information sharing).
227 For example, sharing information about the type of attack can be used to draw inferences about the type of
system that was targeted, which may imply a particular target entity (i.e., the entity known to use that
system).
example, an incident that affects the ability of an important money market fund could be used by
the Commission to initiate an inter-agency response aimed at ensuring stability in the money
markets.228 Alternatively, patterns discovered through the reports may trigger referral to national
security agencies for further investigation.
The aforementioned benefits arising from improved information sharing and response
coordination are contingent on the Commission creating effective schemes to do so as well as the
utility of the required reports in mounting effective regulatory responses. In particular, delays in
registrants’ discovery of cybersecurity incidents may hinder the utility of such reports in
triggering a “real-time” regulatory response.229 Thus the utility of such reports may be confined
to information sharing and referrals to law enforcement and national security agencies.
b. Costs
The proposed requirements for advisers and funds to adopt and implement reasonably
designed cybersecurity policies and procedures include provisions related to ongoing monitoring
of threats and vulnerabilities230 as well as provisions related to cybersecurity incident response
and recovery.231 Compliance with the aforementioned provisions effectively requires the
collection of information that is solicited on proposed Form ADV-C.
232 Thus, we do not believe
that the proposed reporting requirement would impose compliance costs beyond those related to
developing and implementing reasonably designed policies and procedures discussed in section
III.D.1. The proposed filing requirements would entail certain administrative costs, and these are
discussed in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV. Other costs that could arise
from the reporting provisions would be the potential for the unintended release of information
 228 Depending on the circumstances, such responses could be coordinated through FSOC or through bilateral
contacts with other regulators.
229 Under the proposed rules registrants would have to report incidents within 48 hours. See proposed rule
204-6(a).
230 See supra section II.A.1.d.
231 See supra section II.A.1.e.
232 See proposed rules 206(4)-9(a)(5) and 38a-2(a)(5).
disclosed on Form ADV-C through the Commission’s response to such disclosures. Unintended
release of such details could facilitate future cyberattacks against funds and advisers as well as
against advisers and fund with similar vulnerabilities.
4. Recordkeeping
Under the new recordkeeping requirements advisers and funds would be required to
maintain, for five years records of: (1) cybersecurity policies and procedures;
233 (2) annual
reviews thereof; (3) documents related to the annual reviews; (4) regulatory filings234 related to
cybersecurity incidents required under the proposed amendments;
235 (5) any cybersecurity
incident; and (6) cybersecurity risk assessments.
a. Benefits
These proposed amendments would help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and
enforcement capabilities. As a result, the Commission would be better able to detect deficiencies
in the advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity hygiene so that such deficiencies could be remedied.
Insofar as correcting deficiencies results in material improvement in the cybersecurity practices
of individual advisers and funds that would reduce the risk and/or magnitude of future
cybersecurity incidents, the proposed amendments would benefit clients and investors.
b. Costs
We do not expect the proposed recordkeeping requirements to impose additional
compliance costs not covered elsewhere in this analysis. The compliance costs related to the
creation of records subject to the recordkeeping provisions are covered in section III.D.1. As
advisers and funds are currently subject to substantially similar recordkeeping requirements
applicable to other required policies and procedures, we do not expect registrants will need to
 233 See proposed rules 204-2 and 38a-2(e).
234 For advisers, copies of any Form ADV-C filed. For funds, reports provided to the Commission pursuant to
proposed rule 38a-2(a)(5).
235 See proposed rules 204-2 and 38a-2(e).
invest in new recordkeeping staff, systems, or procedures to satisfy the new recordkeeping
requirements.
236 The marginal administrative costs arising from maintaining additional records
related to these provisions using existing systems are covered in the Paperwork Reduction Act
analysis in section IV.
E. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
As discussed in the foregoing sections, market imperfections could lead to
underinvestment in cybersecurity by advisers and funds, and information asymmetry could
contribute to inefficient production of cybersecurity defenses. The proposed rules and
amendments aim to mitigate the inefficiencies resulting from these imperfections by: (1)
imposing mandates on cybersecurity policies and procedures that could reduce cybersecurity
underinvestment;237 (2) providing additional disclosure to inform clients and investors about
advisers’ and funds’ cybersecurity efforts, reducing information asymmetry;238 and (3) creating a
reporting framework that could improve information sharing and improved cybersecurity defense
production.
239 While the proposed rules and amendments have the potential to mitigate
inefficiencies resulting from market imperfections, the scale of the overall effect will depend on
numerous factors, including: the state of existing of cybersecurity preparations,
240 the degree to
which the proposed provisions induce increases to these preparations,
241 the effectiveness of
additional preparations at reducing cybersecurity risks,
242 the degree to which clients and
investors value additional cybersecurity preparations,
243 the degree of information asymmetry
 236 See proposed rules 204-2(a)(17) and 38-2(e).
237 See supra footnotes 92-96 and accompanying text; section III.D.1.
238 See supra footnotes 92-96 and accompanying text; section III.D.2.
239 See supra footnotes 118-123 and accompanying text; section III.D.3.
240 See supra section III.C.1. Here, we are concerned about the degree to which registrants’ state of
cybersecurity preparations diverge from socially optimal levels.
241 See supra footnote 175 and accompanying text.
242 Formally, the marginal product of the proposed policies and procedures in the production of cybersecurity
defenses.
243 Formally, clients’ and investors’ utility functions—specifically the marginal utilities of advisers’ and funds’
and bargaining power between clients and investors vis-à-vis advisers and funds,
244 the
bargaining power of registrants vis-à-vis service providers,
245 service providers’ willingness to
provide bespoke contractual provisions to registrants,
246 the informativeness of the proposed
disclosures, the scale of the negative externalities on the broader financial system,
247 the
effectiveness of existing information sharing arrangements, and the informativeness of the
required regulatory reports (as well as the Commission’s ability to make use of them).248 As
discussed earlier in this section, it is not practicable to measure most of these factors. As such, it
is also not practicable to quantify the overall effect of the proposed provisions on economic
efficiency. Although any increased efficiency resulting from the proposed provisions can
generally be expected to lead to improved capital formation,249 quantifying such effects is
similarly impracticable.
250
Because the proposed rules and amendments are likely to have differential effects on
registrants along a number of dimensions, their overall effect on competition among registrants is
difficult to predict. For example, smaller registrants—who we believe are less likely to have
extensive cybersecurity measures already in place—are likely to face disproportionately higher
costs resulting from the proposed rules and amendments.
251 Thus, the proposed rules and

cybersecurity hygiene.
244 In other words, the degree to which clients and investors can affect the policies of advisers and funds.
Generally, we expect that fund investors will typically be small and dispersed and thus be subject to large
information asymmetry and have limited ability to affect the policies of funds. For clients of advisers the
situation is likely to involve more heterogeneity, with some clients wielding very little power over adviser
policies (e.g., small retail clients) while others wield considerable power (e.g., large pension funds).
245 See supra footnotes 184-192 and accompanying text.
246 Id.
247 See supra section III.B.
248 See supra section III.D.3.a.
249 The proposed provisions do not implicate channels typically associated with capital formation (e.g.,
taxation policy, financial innovation, capital controls, investor disclosure, intellectual property, rule-of-law,
and diversification). Thus, the proposed rule amendments are likely to have only indirect, second order
effects on capital formation arising from any improvements to economic efficiency.
250 Id. Qualitatively, these effects are expected to be small.
251 See supra footnote 97 and accompanying text.
amendments could tilt the competitive playing field in favor of larger registrants. On the other
hand, if clients and investors believe that the proposed rules and amendments effectively induce
the appropriate level of cybersecurity effort among registrants, smaller registrants would likely
benefit most from these improved perceptions. Similar differential effects could apply to
registrants and service providers that are more (or less) focused on their digital business.
With respect to competition among registrants’ service providers, the overall effect of the
proposed rules and amendments is similarly ambiguous. It is likely that requiring affected
registrants to provide oversight of service providers’ cybersecurity practices pursuant to a written
contract would lead some service providers to cease offering services to affected registrants.252
This would almost certainly “reduce” competition in a crude sense: the number of potential
service providers available to registrants would likely be diminished. However, this may
“improve” competition in another sense: service providers with “inadequate” cybersecurity
practices (i.e., those unwilling to commit contractually to implementing cybersecurity practices
deemed “reasonably designed” by the registrant) would be unable to undercut service providers
with “adequate” cybersecurity practices.
F. Alternatives Considered
In formulating our proposal, we have considered various alternatives. Those alternatives
are discussed below and we have also requested comments on certain of these alternatives.
1. Alternatives to the Proposed Policies and Procedures Requirement
a. Require Only Disclosure of Cybersecurity Policies and
Procedures Without Prescribing Elements
Rather than requiring registrants to adopt cybersecurity policies and procedures with
specific enumerated elements, the Commission considered requiring advisers and funds to only
provide explanations or summaries of their cybersecurity practices to their clients or investors.
 252 See supra footnotes 184-192 and accompanying text.
We believe that such an approach would create weaker incentives to address potential
underspending in cybersecurity measures as it would rely entirely on clients’ and investors’ (or
third parties’ providing analysis to clients and investors)253 ability to assess the effectiveness of
registrants’ cybersecurity practices from registrants’ explanations. Given the cybersecurity risks
of disclosing detailed explanations of cybersecurity practices,254 it is likely that such
explanations would include only vague boilerplate language and provide little information that
could be used by observers to infer the degree of cybersecurity preparedness. Such a
“disclosure-only” regime is unlikely to be effective at resolving the underlying information
asymmetry and would therefore be unlikely to affect meaningful change in registrants’
cybersecurity practices.
255 Moreover, not requiring specific enumerated elements in
cybersecurity policies and procedures would likely result in less uniform cybersecurity
preparedness across registrants, undermining clients’ and investors’ broader confidence in the
fund and adviser industries. At the same time, the costs associated with this alternative would
likely be minimal, as registrants would be unlikely to face pressure to adjust practices as a result
of such disclosures.
b. Require Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures with More
Limited Prescribed Elements
We also considered paring down some enumerated elements from the proposed
cybersecurity policies and procedures requirement, more specifically the oversight of service
providers component of the information protection element. In this regard, we considered
narrowing the scope of the types of service providers to named service providers discussed
further above and requiring a periodic review and assessment of a named service provider’s
cybersecurity policies and procedures in lieu of a written contract. We further considered
 253 See supra footnote 208 and accompanying text.
254 See supra section III.D.2.B (discussing tradeoffs of cybersecurity disclosure).
255 Here changes in cybersecurity practices would depend entirely on market discipline exerted by relatively
uninformed market participants.
requiring service providers that receive, maintain, or process adviser or fund information to
provide security certifications in lieu of the written contract requirement.
Narrowing the scope of the types of service providers affected by the proposal could
lower costs for registrants, especially smaller registrants who rely on generic service providers
and would have difficulty effecting changes in contractual terms with such service providers.
256
However, given that in the current technological context257 cybersecurity risk exposure of
registrants is unlikely to be limited to (or even concentrated in) certain named service providers,
narrowing the scope of service providers would likely lead to lower costs only insofar as it
reduces effectiveness of the regulation. In other words, absent a written contractual arrangement
with a service provider relating to the provider’s cybersecurity practices, it is unlikely that
registrants could satisfy their overarching obligations under the proposed rules.
Alternatively, maintaining the proposed scope but only requiring a standard, recognized,
certification in lieu of a written contract could also lead to cost savings for registrants.258
However, we preliminarily believe that it would be difficult to prescribe a set of characteristics
for such a “standard” certification that would sufficiently address the varied types of advisers and
funds and their respective service providers.
259
c. Require Specific Prescriptive Requirements for Addressing
Cybersecurity Risks
The Commission considered including more prescriptive elements in the cybersecurity
policies and procedures requirement of the current proposal. For example, advisers and funds
could have been required to implement particular controls (e.g., specific encryption protocols,
 256 See supra section III.D.1.b (discussing service providers).
257 Specifically, a context where businesses increasingly rely on third-party “cloud services” that effectively
place business data out of the business’ immediate control.
258 Service providers may currently be providing certifications as part of an adviser’s or fund’s policies and
procedures.
259 See supra section III.C.3 (discussing the variety of affected registrants); see also infra section III.F.1.c
(discussing limitation of uniform prescriptive requirements).
network architecture, or authentication procedures) designed to address each general element of
the required cybersecurity policies and procedures. Given the considerable diversity in the size,
focus, and technical sophistication of affected registrants,
260 any specific requirements would
result in some registrants needing to substantially alter their cybersecurity policies and
procedures.
The potential benefit of such an approach would be to provide assurance that advisers and
funds have implemented certain specific cybersecurity hygiene practices. But this approach
would also entail considerably higher costs as many registrants would need to adjust their
existing practices. Considering the variety of advisers and funds registered with the
Commission, it would be exceedingly difficult for the Commission to devise specific
requirements that are appropriately suited for all registrants: a uniform set of requirements would
certainly be both over- and under-inclusive, while providing varied requirements based on the
circumstances of the registrant would be complex and impractical. For example, uniform
prescriptive requirements that ensure reasonably designed cybersecurity policies and procedures
for the largest, most sophisticated advisers and funds would likely be overly burdensome for
smaller, less sophisticated advisers with more limited cybersecurity exposures. Conversely, if
these uniform prescriptive requirements were tailored to advisers and funds with more limited
operations or cybersecurity risk, such requirements likely would be inadequate to address larger
registrants’ cybersecurity risks appropriately. Alternatively, providing different requirements for
different categories of registrants would involve considerable regulatory complexity in
delineating the classes of advisers and defining the appropriate requirements for each class.
More broadly, imposing detailed prescriptive requirements would effectively place the
Commission in the role of dictating details of the IT practices of registrants without the benefit of
the registrants’ knowledge of their own particular circumstances. Moreover, given the complex
 260 See supra section III.C.3.
and constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape, detailed regulatory requirements for
cybersecurity practices would likely limit registrants’ ability to adapt quickly to changes in the
cybersecurity landscape.261
d. Require Audits of Internal Controls Regarding Cybersecurity
Instead of requiring advisers and funds to adopt and implement cybersecurity policies and
procedures, the Commission considered requiring advisers and funds to obtain audits of the
effectiveness of their existing cybersecurity controls—for example, by obtaining service
organization control audits with respect to their cybersecurity practices. This approach would
not have required advisers and funds to adopt and implement cybersecurity policies and
procedures as proposed, but instead would have required advisers and funds to engage an
independent qualified third party to assess their cybersecurity controls and prepare a report
describing its assessment and any potential deficiencies.
Under this alternative, an independent third party (e.g., an auditing firm) would certify to
the effectiveness of the adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity practices. If the firms providing such
certifications have sufficient reputational motives to issue credible assessment,
262 and if the
scope of such certifications is not overly circumscribed,263 it is likely that registrants’
cybersecurity practices would end up being more robust under this alternative than under the
current proposal. By providing certification of a registrant’s cybersecurity practices, a firm
would—in effect—be “lending” its reputation to the registrant. Because “lenders” are naturally
most sensitive to down-side risks (here, loss of reputation, lawsuits, damages, regulatory
 261 If as in the previous example, the Commission were to require registrants to adopt a specific encryption
algorithm, future discovery of vulnerabilities in that algorithm would prevent registrants from fully
mitigating the vulnerability (i.e., switching to improved algorithms) in the absence of Commission action.
262 This would be the case if there was sufficient market pressure or regulatory requirements to obtain
certification from “reputable” third-parties with business models premised on operating as a going-concern
and maintaining a reputation for honesty.
263 We are assuming that in this alternative, certification would not be limited to only evaluating whether a
registrant’s stated policies and procedures are reasonably designed, but rather also would include an
assessment of whether the policies and procedures are actually implemented in an effective manner.
enforcement actions), one would expect them to avoid “lending” to registrants with cybersecurity
practices whose effectiveness is questionable.
264
While certification by credible third parties could lead to more robust cybersecurity
practices, the costs of such an approach would likely be considerably higher. Because of the
aforementioned sensitivity to down-side risk, firms would likely be hesitant to provide
cybersecurity certifications without a thorough understanding of a registrant’s systems and
practices; in many cases, developing such an understanding would involve considerable effort.265
In addition, it is possible that the inherent ambiguity of what represents “effective” practices in
an evolving context like cybersecurity would lead to a reluctance among third parties to provide
the necessary certification services.266
e. Vary Requirements of the Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity
and Procedures for Different Subsets of Advisers and Funds
The Commission considered requiring different elements in an adviser’s or fund’s
cybersecurity policies and procedures based on characteristics of the adviser or fund. For
example, advisers or funds with assets under management below a certain threshold or with only
a limited number of clients or investors could have been required to implement more limited
cybersecurity policies and procedures.
This approach could have scaled based on adviser or fund size, business or other criteria,
with larger firms, for example, being required to address more elements in their cybersecurity
policies and procedures or being required to implement more prescriptive cybersecurity
 264 Under the proposal it is the registrant itself that effectively “certifies” its own cybersecurity policies and
procedures. Like the third-party auditor, the registrant faces down-side risks from “certifying” inadequate
cybersecurity practices (i.e., Commission enforcement actions). However, unlike the auditor, the registrant
also realizes the potential up-side: cost savings through reduced cybersecurity expenditures.
265 It would be difficult for an auditor to provide a credible assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant’s
cybersecurity practices without first understanding the myriad of systems involved and how those practices
are implemented. Presumably, a registrant would not bear these costs as it is likely to possess such an
understanding.
266 What constitutes “effective” practices with respect to cybersecurity is likely not as universally accepted as
what constitutes “adequate” internal controls with respect to accounting or financial disclosure. Thus
certifying a firm’s cybersecurity practices would likely involve more litigation risk and uncertainty than
traditional financial auditing.
measures. However, as discussed above, cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities are likely to be
unique to each adviser and fund depending on its particular operations, which could make it
difficult to use any specific characteristics such as firm size, for example, as an effective proxy to
determine the scope of their cybersecurity policies and procedures.
f. Administration and Oversight of Cybersecurity Policies and
Procedures
The Commission considered various alternative requirements with respect to
administration and oversight of an adviser’s or fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures such
as requiring advisers and funds to designate a CISO or requiring funds’ boards to oversee
directly a fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures. There is a broad spectrum of potential
approaches to this alternative, ranging from the largely nominal (e.g., requiring registrants to
designate someone to be a CISO) to the stringent (e.g., requiring a highly qualified CISO to
attest to the effectiveness of the registrant’s policies).
While employee designations and similar nominal requirements may improve
accountability and enhance compliance in certain contexts, they are unlikely to lead to material
improvements in highly technical aspects of business operations. Given the technical complexity
of cybersecurity issues, imposing such nominal requirements is unlikely to do much to further
the policy objectives or provide substantial economic benefit. At the same time, while such an
approach would increase regulatory complexity, it would likely entail minimal costs for
registrants.
On the other hand, stringent requirements such as requiring an attestation from a highly
qualified CISO as to the effectiveness of a registrant’s cybersecurity practices in specific
enumerated areas could be quite effective. Expert practitioners in cybersecurity are in high
demand and command high salaries.267 Thus, such an approach would impose substantial
 267 A recent survey reports CISO median total compensation of $668,903 for CISOs at companies with
revenues of $5 billion or less. See Matt Aiello and Scott Thompson, 2020 North American Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO) Compensation Survey, Heidrick & Struggles (2020), available at
https://www.heidrick.com/-/media/heidrickcom/publications-and-reports/2020-north-american-chief-
ongoing costs on registrants who do not already have appropriately qualified individuals on staff.
This burden would be disproportionately borne by smaller registrants, for whom keeping a
dedicated CISO on staff would be cost prohibitive. Allowing registrants to employ part-time
CISOs would mitigate this cost burden, but such requirements would likely create a de facto
“audit” regime. Such an audit regime would certainly be more effective if explicitly designed to
function as such.268
2. Modify Requirements for Structuring Disclosure of Cybersecurity
Risks and Incidents
The Commission considered changing the scope of the tagging requirements for the
proposed fund cybersecurity incident disclosures, such as by removing the requirements for all or
a subset of funds. For example, the tagging requirements could have excluded unit investment
trusts, which are not currently required to tag any filings in Inline XBRL.269 Under such an
alternative, unit investment trusts would submit their cybersecurity disclosures in unstructured
HTML or ASCII, and forego the initial Inline XBRL implementation costs (such as the cost of
training in-house staff to prepare filings in Inline XBRL, and the cost to license Inline XBRL
filing preparation software from vendors) and ongoing Inline XBRL compliance burdens that
would result from the proposed tagging requirement.270 However, narrowing the scope of
tagging requirements, whether based on fund structure, fund size, or other criteria, would

information-security-officer-ciso-compensation-survey.pdf.
268 In designing an effective audit regime, aligning incentives of auditors to provide credible assessments is a
central concern. In the context of audit regimes, barriers to entry and the reputation motives of auditing
firms helps align incentives. It would be considerably more difficult to obtain similar incentive alignment
with itinerant part-time CISOs. See supra section III.F.1.d (describing the audit regime alternative).
269 By contrast, funds that file Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6 are currently subject to Inline XBRL
tagging requirements for portions of those filings. See supra footnote 85.
270 See infra section III.D.3.b. Funds file registration statements and amendments using the Commission’s
EDGAR electronic filing system, which generally requires filers to use ASCII or HTML for their document
submissions, subject to certain exceptions. See Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.101(a)(1)(iv); 17 CFR
232.301; EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 60 (Dec. 2021), at 5-1. To the extent unit investment
trusts are part of the same fund family as other types of funds that are subject to Inline XBRL requirements,
they may be able to leverage those other funds’ existing Inline XBRL tagging experience and software,
which would mitigate the initial Inline XBRL implementation costs that unit investment trusts would incur
under the proposal.
diminish the extent of any informational benefits that would accrue as a result of the proposed
disclosure requirements by making the excluded funds’ cybersecurity incident disclosures
comparatively costlier to process and analyze.
The scope of structuring requirements for the proposed disclosures could also have been
expanded to cover advisers in addition to funds. Under the proposal, advisers would provide the
required cybersecurity disclosures as part of their narrative brochures, which advisers must file
electronically with the Commission as a text-searchable PDF file using the FINRA-administered
IARD system.271 Alternatively, the Commission could require advisers to structure the
cybersecurity disclosures in IARD-specific XML. Such a requirement would not impose
additional incremental compliance costs on advisers, who would use an online form provided by
the IARD system to submit their disclosures and would not be required to develop technical
expertise to comply with the structuring requirement.272 However, such an alternative would
result in investors receiving most of the narrative brochure disclosures in PDF format and the
remaining cybersecurity disclosures—outside the PDF brochure—in IARD-specific XML, which
could lead to investor confusion about the location of the disclosures.
3. Public Disclosure of Form ADV-C
The Commission considered requiring the public disclosure of Form ADV-C in the
proposal. Assuming that the information submitted by registrants through Form ADV-C filings
does not change, making Form ADV-C filings public would increase clients’ and investors’
information about cybersecurity incidents and thus improve their ability to draw inferences about
an adviser’s or fund’s level of cybersecurity preparations. At the same time, doing so would also
assist would-be attackers, who would gain additional insight into the vulnerabilities of a victim’s
systems. As discussed in section III.D.2.b, release of too much detail about a cybersecurity
 271 See 17 CFR 275.203(a)(1); General Instruction 5 of Form ADV Part 2. The proposed requirement is also
more technically feasible than an Inline XBRL requirement for the advisers’ disclosures, because the IARD
system does not currently accommodate Inline XBRL filings.
272 See FINRA Form ADV Guide, available at https://www.iard.com/sites/iard/files/formADV_guide.pdf.
incident could further compromise cybersecurity of the victim, especially in the short term.
Given these risks, requiring public disclosure of Form ADV-C filings would likely have the
effect of significantly reducing the detail provided by registrants in these filings. As a result, the
information set of clients, investors, and would-be attackers would remain largely unchanged
(vis-à-vis the proposal), while the ability of the Commission to facilitate information sharing and
to coordinate responses aimed at reducing systemic risks to the financial system would be
diminished.
IV. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
Certain provisions of the proposed amendments contain “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).273 We are
submitting the proposed collections of information to the Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA.274 The proposed rules 206(4)-9, 38a-2, 204-6,
and proposed new Form ADV-C would include new information collection burdens, and the
proposed amendments would have an effect on the current collection of information burdens of
rule 204-2 and rule 204-3 under the Investment Advisers Act and Form ADV, as well as Form
N-1A and other registration forms with respect to the Investment Company Act.
Certain funds have current requirements to submit to the Commission information
included in their registration statements, or information included in or amended by any posteffective amendments to such registration statements, in response to certain form items in
structured data language (“Investment Company Interactive Data”).
275 This also includes the
requirement for funds to submit interactive data to the Commission for any form of prospectus
 273 44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3521.
274 44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 CFR 1320.11.
275 The paperwork burdens for the rules under section 8(b) of the Investment Company Act are imposed
through the forms and reports that are subject to the requirements in these rules and are reflected in the
PRA burdens of those documents.
filed pursuant to 17 CFR 230.497(c) or 17 CFR 230.497(e) under the Securities Act that includes
information in response to certain form items. The proposed amendments to fund registration
forms include new structured data requirements to tag information about significant fund
cybersecurity incidents using Inline XBRL. Although the interactive data filing requirements are
included in the instructions to each form, we are separately reflecting the hour and cost burdens
for these requirements in the burden estimate for Investment Company Interactive Data and not
in the estimate for each registration statement form.
The titles of new collections of information we are proposing are “Rule 206(4)-9 under
the Investment Advisers Act,” “Rule 38a-2 under the Investment Company Act,” “Rule 204-6
under the Investment Advisers Act,” and “Form ADV-C.” OMB has not yet assigned control
numbers for these titles. The titles for the existing collections of information are: (1) “Rule 204-
2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940” (OMB control number 3235-0278); (2) Rule 204-
3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940” (OMB control number 3235-0047); (3) “Form
ADV” (OMB control number 3235-0049); (4) “Form N-1A, Registration Statement under the
Securities Act and under the Investment Company Act for Open-End Management Investment
Companies” (OMB control number 3235-0307); (5) “Form N-2, Registration Statement of
Closed-End Management Investment Companies” (OMB control number 3235-0026); (6) “Form
N-3, Registration of Separate Accounts Organized as Management Investment Companies”
(OMB control number 3235-0316); (7) “Form N-4, Registration Statement of Separate Accounts
Organized as Unit Investment Trust” (OMB control number 3235-0318); (8) “Form N-6,
Registration Statement of Separate Accounts Organized as Unit Investment Trust” (OMB control
number 3235-0503); (9) “Form N-8B-2, Registration Statement of Unit Investment Trusts Which
Are Currently Issuing Securities” (OMB control number 3235-0186); (10) “Form S-6, for
Registration under the Securities Act of Unit Investment Trusts registered on Form N-8B-2”
(OMB control number 3235-0184); and (11) “Investment Company Interactive Data” (OMB
control number 3235-0642).
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
Each requirement to disclose information, offer to provide information, or adopt policies and
procedures constitutes a collection of information requirement under the PRA. These collections
of information would help increase the likelihood that advisers and funds are prepared to respond
to a cybersecurity incident, and collectively would serve the Commission’s interest in protecting
investors by reducing the risk that a cybersecurity incident could significantly affect a firm’s
operations and lead to significant harm to clients and investors. The Commission staff would
also use the collection of information in its examination and oversight program in identifying
patterns and trends across registrants. We discuss below the collection of information burdens
associated with the proposed rules and rule amendments.
B. Rule 206(4)-9
Proposed rule 206(4)-9 would require an adviser to adopt and implement written policies
and procedures that are reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks.276 These
cybersecurity policies and procedures would need to be tailored based on the complexity of the
adviser’s business operations and attendant cybersecurity risks. The proposed rule would require
policies and procedures that address: (1) risk assessment, (2) user security and access, (3)
information protection, (4) cybersecurity threat and vulnerability management, and (5)
cybersecurity incident response and recovery. The proposed rule includes certain minimum
activities associated with each of these elements, including requirements for an adviser to
identify and oversee any service providers that receive, maintain, or process adviser information,
or are otherwise permitted to access its information systems and any information residing
therein.
 276 See proposed rule 206(4)-9; supra section II.A (discussing the cybersecurity policies and procedures
requirements).
In addition to adopting and implementing such policies and procedures, the proposed rule
would require advisers to review and assess, at least annually, the design and effectiveness of
their cybersecurity policies and procedures. More specifically, proposed rule 206(4)-9 would
require that an adviser at least annually: (1) review and assess the design and effectiveness of the
cybersecurity policies and procedures; and (2) prepare a written report that, at a minimum,
describes the review, assessment, and any control tests performed, explains their results,
documents any cybersecurity incident that occurred since the date of the last report, and
discusses any material changes to the policies and procedures since the date of the last report.277
The respondents to these collection of information requirements would be investment
advisers that are registered or required to be registered with the Commission. As of October 31,
2021, there were 14,774 investment advisers registered with the Commission. As noted above,
these requirements are mandatory, and all registered investment advisers would be subject to the
requirements of the proposed rule. Responses provided to the Commission in the context of its
examination and oversight program concerning proposed rule 206(4)-9 would be kept
confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. These collections of information would
help increase the likelihood that advisers and funds are prepared to respond to a cybersecurity
incident, and help protect investors from being significantly harmed by a cybersecurity incident.
These collections would also help facilitate the Commission’s inspection and enforcement
capabilities. We have made certain estimates of the burdens associated with the proposed rule
solely for the purpose of this PRA analysis. The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing
annual burden and cost estimates associated with the proposed rule’s policies and procedures and
review and report requirements.

inflation.
3. These estimates are based on an average. Some firms may have a lower burden in the case they will be evaluating exiting policies and
procedures with respect to any cybersecurity risks and/or incidents, while other firms may be creating new cybersecurity policies and procedures
altogether.
4. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 5 ongoing annual burden hours. The estimate of 25 hours is based
on the following calculation: ((50 initial hours /3) + 5 additional ongoing burden hours) = 21.67 hours.
5. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 3 hours, for outside legal services.
The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, take into account staff experience, a
variety of sources including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
6. We estimate 10 additional ongoing burden hours.
7. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 2 hours, for outside legal services. See supra note 5 (regarding
wage rates with respect to external cost estimates).
C. Rule 38a-2
Proposed rule 38a-2 would require a fund to adopt and implement written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks.278 These cybersecurity policies
and procedures would address: risk assessment, user security and access, information protection,
threat and vulnerability management, and incident response and recovery. The proposed rule
includes certain minimum activities associated with each of these elements, including
requirements for the fund to identify and oversee any service providers that receive, maintain, or
process fund information, or are otherwise permitted to access its information systems and any
information residing therein.
Under the rule, a fund would also, at least annually: (1) review and assess the design and
effectiveness of those policies and procedures; and (2) prepare and provide to the fund’s board a
written report.
279 The written report would also include an explanation of any control tests
performed, any cybersecurity incident that occurred since the date of the last report, and any
material changes to the policies and procedures since the date of the last report.
Finally, a fund would need to keep records related to the policies and procedures, written
reports, annual review, and any reports provided to the Commission. Specifically, the fund
would have to maintain copies for at least five years, the first two years in an easily accessible
place, of: (1) its cybersecurity policies and procedures; (2) copies of written reports provided to
its board; (3) records documenting the fund’s cybersecurity annual review; (4) any report of a
significant fund cybersecurity incident provided to the Commission by its adviser that the
proposed rule would require; (5) records documenting the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident,
 278 See proposed rule 38a-2; supra section II.A (discussing the cybersecurity policies and procedures
requirements).
279 For unit investment trusts, the written report would be provided to the principal underwriter or depositor.
including records related to any response and recovery from such an incident; and (6) and
records documenting a fund’s cybersecurity risk assessments.
280
Each requirement to disclose information, offer to provide information, or to adopt
policies and procedures constitutes a collection of information requirement under the PRA. The
respondents to proposed rule 38a-2 would be registered investment companies and BDCs.
281 We
estimate that 14,749 funds would be subject to these proposed rule requirements.
282 The
collections of information associated with these requirements would be mandatory, and
responses provided to the Commission in the context of its examination and oversight program
concerning proposed rule 38a-2 would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of
applicable law. These collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds
are prepared to respond to a cybersecurity incident, and help protect investors from being
significantly harmed by a cybersecurity incident. These collections would also help facilitate the
Commission’s inspection and enforcement capabilities. We have made certain estimates of the
burdens associated with the proposed rule, as discussed below, solely for the purpose of this
PRA analysis. The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden and cost

size, employee benefits, overhead, and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation.
3. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 5 ongoing annual burden hours. The estimate of 25 hours is based
on the following calculation: ((60 initial hours /3) + 5 additional ongoing burden hours) = 25 hours.
4. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 12 hours, for outside legal services.
The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, take into account staff experience, a

the following calculation: ((9 initial hours /3) + 3 additional ongoing burden hours) = 6 hours.
6. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 2 hours, for outside legal services. See supra footnote 4
(regarding wage rates with respect to external cost estimates).
7. Includes all registered investment companies, plus BDCs.
8. We estimate that 50% of funds will use outside legal services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into account that funds
may elect to use outside legal services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as fund budget and the fund’s standard practices for
using outside legal services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
D. Rule 204-2
Under section 204 of the Advisers Act, investment advisers registered or required to
register with the Commission under section 203 of the Advisers Act must make and keep for
prescribed periods such records (as defined in section 3(a)(37) of the Exchange Act), furnish
copies thereof, and make and disseminate such reports as the Commission, by rule, may
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
Rule 204-2 sets forth the requirements for maintaining and preserving specified books and
records. This collection of information is found at 17 CFR 275.204-2 and is mandatory. The
Commission staff uses the collection of information in its examination and oversight program.
As noted above, responses provided to the Commission in the context of its examination and
oversight program concerning the proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would be kept
confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law.
As part of the proposed cybersecurity risk management rules, we are proposing
corresponding amendments to rule 204-2, the books and records rule. The proposed
amendments would require advisers to retain: (1) a copy of their cybersecurity policies and
procedures formulated pursuant to proposed rule 206(4)-9 that is in effect, or at any time within
the past five years was in effect; (2) a copy of the adviser’s written report documenting the
annual review of its cybersecurity policies and procedures pursuant to proposed rule 206(4)-9 in
the last five years; (3) a copy of any Form ADV-C filed by the adviser under rule 204-6 in the
last 5 years; (4) records documenting the occurrence of any cybersecurity incident, as defined in
rule 206(4)-9(c), occurring in the last five years, including records related to any response and
recovery from such an incident; and (5) records documenting any risk assessment conducted
pursuant to the cybersecurity policies and procedures required by rule 206(4)-9(a)(1) in the last
five years.
283 These proposed amendments would help facilitate the Commission’s inspection
and enforcement capabilities.
The respondents to this collection of information are investment advisers registered or
required to be registered with the Commission. All such advisers will be subject to the proposed
amendments to rule 204-2. As of October 31, 2021, there were 14,774 advisers that would be
subject to these policies and procedures requirement. In our most recent Paperwork Reduction
Act submission for rule 204-2, we estimated for rule 204-2 a total annual aggregate hour burden
of 2,764,563 hours, and the total annual aggregate external cost burden is $175,980,426.

table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden estimates associated with the
proposed amendments to rule 204-2.

E. Rule 204-6
Proposed rule 204-6 would require investment advisers to report on new Form ADV-C a
significant adviser cybersecurity incident or a significant fund cybersecurity incident. The rule
would define a significant adviser cybersecurity incident as a cybersecurity incident, or a group
of related incidents, that significantly disrupts or degrades the adviser’s ability, or the ability of a
private fund client of the adviser, to maintain critical operations, or leads to the unauthorized
access or use of adviser information, where the unauthorized access or use of such information
results in: (1) substantial harm to the adviser, or (2) substantial harm to a client, or an investor in
a private fund, whose information was accessed.286 Proposed rule 204-6 would also require
advisers to amend promptly any previously filed Form ADV-C in the event information reported
on the form becomes materially inaccurate; if new material information about a previously
reported incident is discovered; and after resolving a previously reported incident or closing an
internal investigation pertaining to pertaining to a previously disclosed incident.
The respondents to this collection of information are investment advisers registered or
required to be registered with the Commission. As noted above, this requirement is mandatory,
and all registered investment advisers will be subject to the requirements of the proposed rule.
Responses provided to the Commission would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of
applicable law. This collection of information would help the Commission’s examination and
oversight program efforts in identifying patterns and trends across registrants regarding such
incidents. As of October 31, 2021, there were 14,774 registered advisers that would be subject to
this reporting requirement. The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden
and cost estimates associated with the proposed rule’s reporting requirement.

2. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 3 hours, for outside legal services.
The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, take into account staff experience, a
variety of sources including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
3. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 1 hour, for outside legal services.
F. Form ADV-C
The Commission is proposing a new Form ADV-C to require an adviser to provide
information regarding a significant cybersecurity incident in a structured format through a series
of check-the-box and fill-in-the-blank questions. Proposed Form ADV-C would require advisers
to report certain information regarding a significant cybersecurity incident in order to allow the
Commission and its staff to understand the nature and extent of the cybersecurity incident and
the adviser’s response to the incident. We believe that collecting information in a structured
format would enhance the Commission’s and its staff’s ability to effectively carry out the riskbased examination program and other risk assessment and monitoring activities. The structured
format would also assist the Commission and its staff in assessing trends in cybersecurity
incidents across the industry.
The respondents to this collection of information are investment advisers registered or
required to be registered with the Commission. As noted above, the collection of this
information is mandatory for all registered advisers. Information filed on Form ADV-C would
be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. As of October 31, 2021, there
were 14,774 registered advisers that would be subject to this reporting requirement. The table
below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden and cost estimates associated with filing
proposed Form ADV-C.

G. Form ADV
Form ADV is the investment adviser registration form under the Advisers Act. Part 1 of
Form ADV contains information used primarily by Commission staff, and Part 2A is the client
brochure. Part 2B requires advisers to create brochure supplements containing information about
certain supervised persons. Part 3: Form CRS (relationship summary) requires certain registered
investment advisers to prepare and file a relationship summary for retail investors. We use the
information on Form ADV to determine eligibility for registration with us and to manage our
regulatory and examination programs. Clients and investors use certain of the information to
determine whether to hire or retain an investment adviser, as well as what types of accounts and
services are appropriate for their needs. The collection of information is necessary to provide
advisory clients, prospective clients, other market participants and the Commission with
information about the investment adviser and its business, conflicts of interest and personnel.
Rule 203-1 under the Advisers Act requires every person applying for investment adviser
registration with the Commission to file Form ADV. Rule 204-4 under the Advisers Act requires
certain investment advisers exempt from registration with the Commission (“exempt reporting
advisers” or “ERAs”) to file reports with the Commission by completing a limited number of
items on Form ADV. Rule 204-1 under the Advisers Act requires each registered and exempt
reporting adviser to file amendments to Form ADV at least annually, and requires advisers to
submit electronic filings through IARD. The paperwork burdens associated with rules 203-1,
204-1, and 204-4 are included in the approved annual burden associated with Form ADV and
thus do not entail separate collections of information. These collections of information are found
at 17 CFR 275.203-1, 275.204-1, 275.204-4 and 279.1 (Form ADV itself) and are mandatory.
Responses are not kept confidential.
We are proposing amendments to Form ADV to provide clients and prospective clients
with information regarding an adviser’s cybersecurity risks and significant cybersecurity
incidents that have occurred in the past two years. Specifically, the proposed amendments would
add a new Item 20 entitled “Cybersecurity Risks and Incidents” to Form ADV’s narrative
brochure, or Part 2A. The brochure, which is publicly available and the primary client-facing
disclosure document, contains information about the investment adviser’s business practices,
fees, risks, conflicts of interest, and disciplinary events. We believe the narrative format of the
brochure would allow advisers to present clear and meaningful cybersecurity disclosure to their
clients and prospective clients. Advisers would be required to, in plain English, describe
cybersecurity risks that could materially affect the advisory services they offer and describe how
they assess, prioritize, and address cybersecurity risks created by the nature and scope of their
business. The proposed amendments would also require advisers to describe any significant
adviser cybersecurity incidents that have occurred within the last two years.
The collection of information is necessary to improve information available to us and to
the general public about advisers’ cybersecurity risks and incidents. Our staff would use this
information to help prepare for examinations of investment advisers. This information would be
particularly useful for staff in reviewing an adviser’s compliance with the proposed rulemakings
and rule amendments. We are not proposing amendments to Parts 1 or 3 of Form ADV.
The respondents to current Form ADV are investment advisers registered with the
Commission or applying for registration with the Commission and exempt reporting advisers.287
Based on the IARD system data as of October 31, 2021, approximately 14,774 investment
advisers were registered with the Commission, and 4,985 exempt reporting advisers file reports
with the Commission. The amendments we are proposing would increase the information
requested in Part 2A of Form ADV for registered investment advisers. Because exempt
reporting advisers are not required to complete Form ADV Part 2A, they would not be subject to
the proposed amendments to Form ADV Part 2A and would therefore not be subject to this
collection of information.288 However, these exempt reporting advisers are included in the PRA
for purposes of updating the overall Form ADV information collection. In addition, the burdens
associated with completing Part 3 are included in the PRA for purposes of updating the overall
 287 An exempt reporting adviser is an investment adviser that relies on the exemption from investment adviser
registration provided in either section 203(l) of the Advisers Act because it is an adviser solely to one or
more venture capital funds or section 203(m) of the Advisers Act because it is an adviser solely to private
funds and has assets under management in the United States of less than $150 million.
288 An exempt reporting adviser is not a registered investment adviser and therefore would not be subject to the
proposed amendments to Item 5 of Form ADV Part 1A. Exempt reporting advisers are required to
complete a limited number of items in Part 1A of Form ADV (consisting of Items 1, 2.B., 3, 6, 7, 10, 11,
and corresponding schedules), and are not required to complete Part 2.
Form ADV information collection.289 Based on the prior revision of Form ADV, we estimated
the annual compliance burden to comply with the collection of information requirement of Form
ADV is 433,004 burden hours and an external cost burden estimate of $14,125,083.290 We
propose the following changes to our PRA methodology for Form ADV:
• Form ADV Parts 1 and 2. Form ADV PRA has historically calculated a per adviser per
year hourly burden for Form ADV Parts 1 and 2 for each of (1) the initial burden and (2)
the ongoing burden, which reflects advisers’ filings of annual and other-than-annual
updating amendments. We noted in previous PRA amendments that most of the
paperwork burden for Form ADV Parts 1 and 2 would be incurred in the initial
submissions of Form ADV. However, recent PRA amendments have continued to apply
the total initial hourly burden for Parts 1 and 2 to all currently registered or reporting
RIAs and ERAs, respectively, in addition to the estimated number of new advisers
expected to be registering or reporting with the Commission annually. We believe that
the total initial hourly burden for Form ADV Parts 1 and 2 going forward should be
applied only to the estimated number of expected new advisers annually. This is because
currently registered or reporting advisers have generally already incurred the total initial
burden for filing Form ADV for the first time. On the other hand, the estimated expected
new advisers will incur the full total burden of initial filing of Form ADV, and we believe
it is appropriate to apply this total initial burden to these advisers. We propose to
continue to apply any new initial burdens resulting from proposed amendments to Form
ADV Part 2, as applicable, to all currently registered or reporting investment advisers
plus all estimated expected new RIAs and ERAs annually.

Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Approved Form ADV PRA”).

Affairs at reginfo.gov (“2021 Form ADV PRA”).
Table 6 below summarizes the burden estimates associated with the proposed amendments to
Form ADV Part 2A. The proposed new burdens take into account changes in the numbers of
advisers since the last approved PRA for Form ADV, and the increased wage rates due to
inflation.

Notes:
1. This column estimates the hourly burden attributable to annual and other-than-annual updating amendments to Form ADV, plus RIAs’ ongoing obligations to
deliver codes of ethics to clients.
2. As with Form ADV generally, and pursuant to the currently approved PRA (see 2021 Form ADV PRA), we expect that for most RIAs and ERAs, the performance
of these functions will most likely be equally allocated between a senior compliance examiner and a compliance manager, or persons performing similar functions.
The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates are based on salary information for the securities industry compiled by the SIFMA Wage Report. The
estimated figures are modified by firm size, employee benefits, overhead, and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation. For RIAs and ERAs that do not already
have a senior compliance or a compliance manager, we expect that a person performing a similar function would have similar hourly costs. The estimated wage rates
in connection with the proposed PRA estimates are adjusted for inflation from the wage rates used in the currently approved PRA analysis.
3. External fees are in addition to the projected hour per adviser burden. Form ADV has a one-time initial cost for outside legal and compliance consulting fees in
connection with the initial preparation of Parts 2 and 3 of the form. In addition to the estimated legal and compliance consulting fees, investment advisers of private
funds incur one-time costs with respect to the requirement for investment advisers to report the fair value of private fund assets.
4. Based on Form ADV data as of October 31, 2021, we estimate that there are 14,774 RIAs (“current RIAs”) and 514 advisers that are expected to become RIAs
annually (“newly expected RIAs”).
5. The $279.50 wage rate reflects current estimates from the SIFMA Wage Report of the blended hourly rate for a senior compliance examiner ($243) and a
compliance manager ($316). ($243 + $316) / 2 = $279.5.
6. We estimate that a quarter of RIAs would seek the help of outside legal services and half would seek the help of compliance consulting services in connection with
the proposed amendments to Form ADV Part 2. This is based on previous estimates and ratios we have used for advisers we expect to use external services for
initially preparing various parts of Form ADV. See 2020 Form ADV PRA Renewal (the subsequent amendment to Form ADV described in the 2021 Form ADV
PRA did not change that estimate). Because the SIFMA Wage Report does not include a specific rate for outside compliance consultant, we are proposing to use the
rates in the SIFMA Wage Report for outside management consultant, as we have done in the past when estimating the rate of outside compliance counsel. We are
adjusting these external costs for inflation, using the currently estimated costs for outside legal counsel and outside management consultants in the SIFMA Wage
Report: $495 per hour for outside counsel, and $739 per hour for outside management consultant (compliance consultants).
7. Per above, we are proposing to revise the PRA calculation methodology to apply the full initial burden only to expected RIAs, as we believe that current RIAs
have generally already incurred the burden of initially preparing Form ADV.
8. See 2020 Form ADV PRA Renewal (stating that the estimate average collection of information burden per adviser for Parts 1 and 2 is 29.22 hours, prior to the
most recent amendment to Form ADV). See also 2021 Form ADV PRA (adding 0.5 hours to the estimated initial burden for Part 1A in connection with the most
recent amendment to Form ADV). Therefore, the current estimated average initial collection of information hourly burden per adviser for Parts 1 and 2 is 29.72 hours
(29.22 + 0.5 = 29.72).
9. The currently approved average total annual burden for RIAs attributable to annual and other-than-annual updating amendments to Form ADV Parts 1 and 2 is
10.5 hours per RIA, plus 1.3 hours per year for each RIA to meet its obligation to deliver codes of ethics to clients (10.5 + 1.3 = 11.8 hours per adviser). See 2020
Form ADV PRA Renewal (these 2020 hourly estimates were not affected by the 2021 amendments to Form ADV). As we explained in previous PRAs, we estimate
that each RIA filing Form ADV Part 1 will amend its form 2 times per year, which consists of one interim updating amendment (at an estimated 0.5 hours per
amendment), and one annual updating amendment (at an estimated 8 hours per amendment), each year. We also explained that we estimate that each RIA will, on
average, spend 1 hour per year making interim amendments to brochure supplements, and an additional 1 hour per year to prepare brochure supplements as required
by Form ADV Part 2. See id.
10. See 2020 Form ADV PRA Renewal (the subsequent amendment to Form ADV described in the 2021 Form ADV PRA did not affect that estimate).
11. External cost per RIA includes the external cost for initially preparing Part 2, which we have previously estimated to be approximately 10 hours of outside legal
counsel for a quarter of RIAs, and 8 hours of outside management consulting services for half of RIAs. See 2020 Form ADV Renewal (these estimates were not
affected by subsequent amendments to Form ADV). We add to this burden the estimated external cost associated with the proposed amendment (an additional hour
of each, bringing the total to 11 hours and 9 hours, respectively, for ¼ and ½ of RIAs, respectively). (((.25 x 14,774 RIAs) x ($496 x 11 hours)) + ((0.50 x 14,774
RIAs) x ($739 x 9 hours))) / 14,774 RIAs = $4,689.50 per adviser.
12. Per above, we are proposing to revise the PRA calculation methodology for current RIAs to not apply the full initial burden to current RIAs, as we believe that
current RIAs have generally already incurred the initial burden of preparing Form ADV. Therefore, we calculate the initial burden associated with complying with
the proposed amendment of 3 initial hours x 14,774 current RIAs = 44,322 initial hours in the first year aggregated for current RIAs. We are not amortizing this
burden because we believe current advisers will incur it in the first year. For expected RIAs, we estimate that they will incur the full revised initial burden, which is
32.72 hours per RIA. Therefore, 32.72 hours x 514 expected RIAs = 16,818.08 aggregate hours for expected RIAs. We do not amortize this burden for expected new
RIAs because we expect a similar number of new RIAs to incur this initial burden each year. Therefore, the total revised aggregate initial burden for current and
expected RIAs is 44,322 hours + 16,818.08 hours = 61,140.08 aggregate initial hours.
13. 12 amendment hours x (14,774 current RIAs + 514 expected new RIAs) = 183,456 aggregate amendment hours.
14. Per above, for current RIAs, we are proposing to not apply the currently approved external cost for initially preparing Part 2, because we believe that current
RIAs have already incurred that initial external cost. For current RIAs, therefore, we are applying only the external cost we estimate they will incur in complying
with the proposed amendment. Therefore, the revised total burden for current RIAs is (((.25 x 14,774 RIAs) x ($496 x 1 hour)) + ((0.50 x 14,774 RIAs) x ($739 x 1
hour))) / 14,774 RIAs = $7,290,969 aggregated for current RIAs, We do not amortize this cost for current RIAs because we expect current RIAs will incur this initial
cost in the first year. For expected RIAs, we apply the currently approved external cost for initially preparing Part 2 plus the estimated external cost for complying
with the proposed amendment. Therefore, $4,689.50 per expected RIA x 514 = $2,410,403 aggregated for expected RIAs. We do not amortize this cost for expected
new RIAs because we expect a similar number of new RIAs to incur this external cost each year. $7,290,969 aggregated for current RIAs + $2,410,403 aggregated
for expected RIAs = $9,701,372 aggregated external cost for RIAs.
15. Even though we are not proposing amendments to Form ADV Part 3 (“Form CRS”), the burdens associated with completing Part 3 are included in the PRA for
purposes of updating the overall Form ADV information collection. Based on Form ADV data as of October 31, 2021, we estimate that 8,877 current RIAs provide
advice to retail investors and are therefore required to complete Form CRS, and we estimate an average of 347 expected new RIAs to be advising retail advisers and
completing Form CRS for the first time annually.
16. See Form CRS Relationship Summary; Amendments to Form ADV, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 5247 (Jun. 5, 2019) [84 FR 33492 (Sep. 10, 2019)]
(“2019 Form ADV PRA”). Subsequent PRA amendments for Form ADV have not adjusted the burdens or costs associated with Form CRS. Because Form CRS is
still a new requirement for all applicable RIAs, we have, and are continuing to, apply the total initial amendment burden to all current and expected new RIAs that are
required to file Form CRS, and amortize that initial burden over three years for current RIAs.
17. As reflected in the currently approved PRA burden estimate, we stated that we expect advisers required to prepare and file the relationship summary on Form
ADV Part 3 will spend an average 1 hour per year making amendments to those relationship summaries and will likely amend the disclosure an average of 1.71 times
per year, for approximately 1.58 hours per adviser. See 2019 Form ADV PRA (these estimates were not amended by the 2021 amendments to Form ADV),
18. See 2020 Form ADV PRA Amendment (this cost was not affected by the subsequent amendment to Form ADV and was not updated in connection with that
amendment; while this amendment did not break out a per adviser cost, we calculated this cost from the aggregate total and the number of advisers we estimated
prepared Form CRS). Note, however, that in our 2020 Form ADV PRA Renewal, we applied the external cost only to expected new retail RIAs, whereas we had
previously applied the external cost to current and expected retail RIAs. We believe that since Form CRS is still a newly adopted requirement, we should continue to
apply the cost to both current and expected new retail RIAs. See 2019 Form ADV PRA.
19. 8,877 current RIAs x 6.67 hours each for initially preparing Form CRS = 59,209.59 aggregate hours for current RIAs initially filing Form CRS. For expected
new RIAs initially filing Form CRS each year, we are not proposing to use the amortized initial burden estimate, because we expect a similar number of new RIAs to
incur the burden of initially preparing Form CRS each year. Therefore, 347 expected new RIAs x 20 initial hours for preparing Form CRS = 6,940 aggregate initial
hours for expected RIAs. 59,209.59 hours + 6,940 hours = 66,149.59 aggregate hours for current and expected RIAs to initially prepare Form CRS.
20. 1.58 hours x (8,877 current RIAs updating Form CRS + 347 expected new RIAs updating Form CRS) = 14,573.92 aggregate amendment hours per year for RIAs
updating Form CRS.
21. We have previously estimated the initial preparation of Form CRS would require 5 hours of external legal services for an estimated quarter of advisers that
prepare Part 3, and; 5 hours of external compliance consulting services for an estimated half of advisers that prepare Part 3. See 2020 PRA Renewal (these estimates
were not amended by the most recent amendment to Form ADV). The hourly cost estimate of $496 and $739 for outside legal services and management consulting
services, respectively, are based on an inflation-adjusted figure in the SIFMA Wage Report. Therefore, (((.25 x 8,877 current RIAs preparing Form CRS) x ($496 x 5
hours)) + ((0.50 x 8,877 current RIAs preparing Form CRS) x ($739 x 5 hours))) = $21,903,997.50. For current RIAs, since this is still a new requirement, we
amortize this cost over three years for a per year initial external aggregated cost of $7,301,332.50. For expected RIAs that we expect would prepare Form CRS each
year, we use the following formula: (((.25 x 347 expected RIAs preparing Form CRS) x ($496 x 5 hours)) + ((0.50 x 347 expected RIAs preparing Form CRS) x
($739 x 5 hours))) = $856,222.50 aggregated cost for expected RIAs. We are not amortizing this initial cost because we estimate a similar number of new RIAs
would incur this initial cost in preparing Form CRS each year, $7,301,332.50 + $856,222.50 = $8,157,555 aggregate external cost for current and expected RIAs to
initially prepare Form CRS.
22. Based on Form ADV data as of October 31, 2021, we estimate that there are 4,985 currently reporting ERAs (“current ERAs”), and an average of 346 expected
new ERAs annually (“expected ERAs”).
23. See 2021 Form ADV PRA.
24. The previously approved average per adviser annual burden for ERAs attributable to annual and updating amendments to Form ADV is 1.5 hours. See 2021
Form ADV PRA. As we have done in the past, we add to this burden the burden for ERAs making final filings, which we have previously estimated to be 0.1 hour
per applicable adviser, and we estimate that an expected 371 current ERAs will prepare final filings annually, based on Form ADV data as of December 2020.
25. For current ERAs, we are proposing to not apply the currently approved burden for initially preparing Form ADV, because we believe that current ERAs have
already incurred this burden. For expected ERAs, we are applying the initial burden of preparing Form ADV of 3.6 hours. Therefore, 3.6 hours x 346 expected new
ERAs per year = 1,245.6 aggregate initial hours for expected ERAs. For these expected ERAs, we are not proposing to amortize this burden, because we expect a
similar number of new ERAs to incur this burden each year. Therefore, we estimate 1,245.6 aggregate initial annual hours for expected ERAs.
26. The previously approved average total annual burden of ERAs attributable to annual and updating amendments to Form ADV is 1.5 hours. See 2020 Form ADV
Renewal (this estimate was not affected by the subsequent amendment to Form ADV). As we have done in the past, we added to this burden the currently approved
burden for ERAs making final filings of 0.1 hour, and multiplied that by the number of final filings we are estimating ERAs would file per year (371 final filings
based on Form ADV data as of December 2020). (1.5 hours x 4,985 currently reporting ERAs) + (0.1 hour x 371 final filings) = 7,514.6 updated aggregated hours
for currently reporting ERAs. For expected ERAs, the aggregate burden is 1.5 hours for each ERA attributable to annual and other-than-annual updating amendments
to Form ADV x 346 expected new ERAs = 519 annual aggregated hours for expected new ERAs updating Form ADV (other than for private fund reporting). The
total aggregate amendment burden for ERAs (other than for private fund reporting) is 7,514.6 + 519 = 8,033.6 hours.
27. Based on Form ADV data as of October 31, 2021, we estimate that 5,232 current RIAs advise 43,501 private funds, and expect an estimated 136 new RIAs will
advise 407 reported private funds per year. We estimate that 4,959 current ERAs advise 23,476 private funds, and estimate an expected 372 new ERAs will advise
743 reported private funds per year. Therefore, we estimate that there are 66,977 currently reported private funds reported by current private fund advisers (43,501 +
23,476), and there will be annually 1,150 new private funds reported by expected private fund advisers (407 + 743). The total number of current and expected new
RIAs that report or are expected to report private funds is 5,368 (5,232 current RIAs that report private funds + 136 expected RIAs that would report private funds).
28. See 2020 Form ADV PRA Renewal (this per adviser burden was not affected by subsequent amendments to Form ADV).
29. We previously estimated that an adviser without the internal capacity to value specific illiquid assets would obtain pricing or valuation services at an estimated
cost of $37,625 each on an annual basis. See Rules Implementing Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Investment Advisers Act Release No. IA3221 (Jun. 22, 2011) [76 FR 42950 (Jul. 19, 2011)]. However, because we estimated that external cost in 2011, we are proposing to use an inflation-adjusted cost of
$46,865.74, based on the CPI calculator published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm. As with previously
approved PRA methodologies, we continue to estimate that 6% of RIAs have at least one private fund client that may not be audited. See 2020 Form ADV PRA
Renewal.
30. Per above, for currently reported private funds, we are proposing to not apply the currently approved burden for initially reporting private funds on Form ADV,
because we believe that current private fund advisers have already incurred this burden. For the estimated 1,150 new private funds annually of expected private fund
advisers, we calculate the initial burden of 1 hour per private fund. 1 hour per expected new private fund x 1,150 expected new private funds = 1,150 aggregate hours
for expected new private funds. For these expected new private funds, we are not proposing to amortize this burden, because we expect new private fund advisers to
incur this burden with respect to new private funds each year. Therefore, we estimate 1,150 aggregate initial hours for expected private fund advisers.
31. As with previously approved PRA methodologies, we continue to estimate that 6% of registered advisers have at least one private fund client that may not be
audited, therefore we estimate that the total number of audits for current and expected RIAs is 6% x 5,368current and expected RIAs reporting private funds or
expected to report private funds = 322.08 audits. We therefore estimate that approximately 322 registered advisers incur costs of $46,865.74 each on an annual basis
(see note 29 describing the cost per audit), for an aggregate annual total cost of $15,090,768.30.
32. 433,004 currently approved burden hours / 18,179 advisers (current and expected annually) = 23.82 hours per adviser. See 2021 Form ADV PRA.
33. $14,125,083 currently approved aggregate external cost / 18,179 advisers (current and expected annually) = $777 blended average external cost per adviser.
34. 335,748.79 aggregate annual hours for current and expected new advisers (see infra note [38]) / (14,774 current RIAs + 514 expected RIAs + 4,985 current ERAs
+346 expected ERAs) = 16.28 blended average hours per adviser.
35. $32,949,695.30 aggregate external cost for current and expected new advisers (see infra note [39]) / (20,619 advisers current and expected annually) = $1,598.03
blended average hours per adviser.
36. See 2021 Form ADV PRA.
37. See 2021 Form ADV PRA.
38. 61,140.08 hours + 183,456 hours + 66,149.59 hours + 14,573.92 hours + 1,245.6 + 8,033.6 hours + 1,150 hours = 335,748.79 aggregate annual hours for current
and expected new advisers.
39. $9,701,372 + $8,157,555 + $15,090,768.30= $32,949,695.30.
H. Rule 204-3
Rule 204-3, the “brochure rule,” requires an investment adviser to deliver its brochure and
brochure supplements to its new clients or prospective clients before or at the start of the
advisory relationship and to deliver annually thereafter the full updated brochure or a summary
of material changes to its brochure. The rule also requires that advisers deliver an amended
brochure or brochure supplement (or just a statement describing the amendment) to clients only
when disciplinary information in the brochure or supplement becomes materially inaccurate.
The brochure assists the client in determining whether to retain, or continue employing, the adviser.
Advisers registered with the Commission are required to prepare and electronically file firm
brochures through the IARD.
Our proposed amendments to rule 204-3 would require an adviser to deliver interim brochure
amendments promptly to existing clients if the adviser adds disclosure of a cybersecurity incident to
its brochure or materially revises information already disclosed in its brochure about such an
incident. We believe that requiring an adviser to deliver the brochure amendment promptly would
enhance investor protection by enabling clients to take protective or remedial measures to the extent
appropriate. It would also assist investors in determining whether their engagement of that
particular adviser remains appropriate and consistent with their investment objectives.
The collection of information the brochure rule requires is necessary for several reasons.
For example, it enables the client or prospective client to evaluate the adviser’s background and
qualifications, and to determine whether the adviser’s services and practices are appropriate for
that client. It also informs the client of the nature of the adviser’s business, which may inform or
limit the client’s rights under the advisory contract. The information that rule 204-3 requires to
be contained in the brochure is used by the Commission and staff in its enforcement, regulatory,
and examination programs.
The respondents to this collection of information are investment advisers registered or
required to be registered with the Commission. As noted above, the collection of this
information is mandatory for all registered advisers. Responses are not kept confidential. As of
October 31, 2021, there were 14,774 registered advisers that would be subject to this brochure
requirement. The table below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden and cost
estimates associated with the proposed rule’s reporting requirement.
Table 7 below summarizes the initial and ongoing annual burden estimates associated with
the proposed amendments to rule 204-3.

Notes:
1. We continue to estimate that, with a bulk mailing, an adviser will require no more than 0.02 hours to send the adviser’s brochure or summary
of material changes to each client, or an annual burden of 1.66 hours per adviser. (0.02 hours per client x 83 clients per adviser based on IARD
data as of October 31, 2021) = approximately 1.66 hours per adviser. We note that the burden for preparing brochures is already incorporated
into a separate burden estimate for Form ADV. We expect that most advisers will make their annual delivery as part of a mailing of an account
statement or other periodic report they already make to clients; therefore, we estimate that the additional burden will be adding a few pages to the
mailing.
2. See approved rule 204-3 PRA.
3. This is the previously approved burden estimate for interim delivery of updates to disciplinary action on Form ADV. We are not changing this
estimate.
4. This relates only to the amount of time it will take advisers to deliver interim updates to clients, as required by the proposed rule amendments.
The burden for preparing interim updates is already incorporated into a separate burden estimate for Form ADV. This mailing may not be
included with a mailing of a statement or other periodic report; therefore, we estimate that it will take slightly more time to deliver interim
updates than to deliver the annual brochure or summary of material changes.
5. We estimate that large advisers will need to design and implement systems to track changes in supervised persons providing investment advice
to particular clients. We do not expect that such systems will be necessary for small advisers or medium advisers.
For purposes of the estimates in this section, we have categorized small advisers as those with 10 or fewer employees, medium-sized advisers as
those with between 11 and 1,000 employees, and large advisers as those with over 1,000 employees. According to IARD data, only 1.70% of
medium advisers report in response to Form ADV, Part 1A, Item 5.B.(1) that more than 250 employees perform investment advisory functions.
6. See approved rule 204-3 PRA. This includes estimated time for large advisers to design and implement systems to track that the right
supplements are delivered to the right clients as personnel providing investment advice to those clients change.
I. Form N-1A
The proposed amendments to Form N-1A would require a description of any significant
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in a fund’s last two fiscal years. The proposed
disclosure amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration
statement whether a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund
or its service providers.
Form N-1A generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(1) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (2) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement.
In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Form N-1A, we estimated for Form
N-1A a total aggregate annual hour burden of 1,672,077 hours, and a total annual aggregate
annual external cost burden of $132,940,008.291 Compliance with the disclosure requirements of
Form N-1A is mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements will not be kept
confidential. These collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds are
prepared to respond to a cybersecurity incident, and would provide Commission staff with
information in its examination and oversight program in identifying patterns and trends across
registrants regarding such incidents. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate
that 13,248 funds would be subject to these proposed amendments.
The table below summarizes our PRA initial and ongoing annual burden estimates
associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A.

size, employee benefits, overhead, and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation.
3. This estimate represents the average burden for a filer. Filers that experience one or several fund cybersecurity incidents are expected to incur
higher burdens.
4. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 8 ongoing annual burden hours. The estimate of 15 hours is based
on the following calculation: ((21 initial hours /3) + 8 additional ongoing burden hours) = 15 hours.
5. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 2 hours, for outside legal services. The Commission’s estimates
of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, take into account staff experience, a variety of sources including
general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
6. Includes all open-end funds, including ETFs, registered on Form N-1A.
7. We estimate that 50% of funds will use outside legal services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into account that funds
may elect to use outside legal services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as fund budget and the fund’s standard practices for
using outside legal services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
J. Form N-2
The proposed amendments to Form N-2 would require a description of any significant
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in a fund’s last two fiscal years. The proposed
disclosure amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration
statement whether a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund,
any subsidiary, or the fund’s service providers.
Form N-2 generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(1) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (2) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement.
In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Form N-2, we estimated for Form
N-2 a total aggregate annual hour burden of 94,350 hours, and a total aggregate annual external
cost burden of $6,269,752.
292 Compliance with the disclosure requirements of Form N-2 is
mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements will not be kept confidential. These
collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds are prepared to respond
to a cybersecurity incident, and would provide Commission staff with information in its
examination and oversight program in identifying patterns and trends across registrants regarding
such incidents. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate that 786 funds,
including BDCs, would be subject to these proposed amendments.

3. This estimate represents the average burden for a filer. Filers that experience one or several fund cybersecurity incidents are expected to
incur higher burdens.
4. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 8 ongoing annual burden hours. The estimate of 15 hours is based
on the following calculation: ((21 initial hours /3) + 8 additional ongoing burden hours) = 15 hours.
5. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 2 hours, for outside legal services. The Commission’s estimates
of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, take into account staff experience, a variety of sources
including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
6. Includes 691 registered closed-end funds and 95 BDCs.
7. We estimate that 50% of funds will use outside legal services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into account that
funds may elect to use outside legal services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as fund budget and the fund’s standard
practices for using outside legal services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
K. Form N-3
The proposed amendments to Form N-3 would require a description of any significant
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in a fund’s last two fiscal years. The proposed
disclosure amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration
statement whether a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund,
insurance company, or the fund’s service providers.
Form N-3 generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(1) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (2) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement.
In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Form N-3, we estimated for Form
N-3 a total aggregate annual hour burden of 2,836 hours, and a total aggregate annual external
cost burden of $123,114.
293 Compliance with the disclosure requirements of Form N-3 is
mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements will not be kept confidential. These
collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds are prepared to respond
to a cybersecurity incident, and would provide Commission staff with information in its
examination and oversight program in identifying patterns and trends across registrants regarding

such incidents. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate that 14 funds would
be subject to these proposed amendments.

Notes:
1. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a 3-year period.
2. The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates are based on the SIFMA Wage Report. The estimated figures are modified by firm
size, employee benefits, overhead, and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation.
3. This estimate represents the average burden for a filer. Filers that experience one or several fund cybersecurity incidents are expected to
incur higher burdens.
4. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 8 ongoing annual burden hours. The estimate of 15 hours is based
on the following calculation: ((21 initial hours /3) + 8 additional ongoing burden hours) = 15 hours.
5. This estimated burden is based on the estimated wage rate of $496/hour, for 2 hours, for outside legal services. The Commission’s estimates
of the relevant wage rates for external time costs, such as outside legal services, take into account staff experience, a variety of sources
including general information websites, and adjustments for inflation.
6. We estimate that 50% of funds will use outside legal services for these collections of information. This estimate takes into account that
funds may elect to use outside legal services (along with in-house counsel), based on factors such as fund budget and the fund’s standard
practices for using outside legal services, as well as personnel availability and expertise.
L. Form N-4
The proposed amendments to Form N-4 would require a description of any significant
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in a fund’s last two fiscal years. The proposed
disclosure amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration
statement whether a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund,
depositor, or the fund’s service providers.
Form N-4 generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(1) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (2) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement.
In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Form N-4, we estimated for Form
N-4 a total aggregate annual hour burden of 292,487 hours, and a total aggregate annual external
cost burden of $33,348,866.
294 Compliance with the disclosure requirements of Form N-4 is
mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements will not be kept confidential. These
collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds are prepared to respond
to a cybersecurity incident, and would provide Commission staff with information in its
examination and oversight program in identifying patterns and trends across registrants regarding
such incidents. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate that 418 funds would
be subject to these proposed amendments.
The table below summarizes our PRA initial and ongoing annual burden estimates
associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-4.

M. Form N-6
The proposed amendments to Form N-6 would require a description of any significant
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in a fund’s last two fiscal years. The proposed
disclosure amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration
statement whether a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund,
depositor, or the fund’s service providers.
Form N-6 generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(1) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (2) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement.
In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Form N-6, we estimated for Form
N-6 a total aggregate annual hour burden of 31,987 hours, and a total aggregate annual external
cost burden of $3,816,692.
295 Compliance with the disclosure requirements of Form N-6 is
mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements will not be kept confidential. These
collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds are prepared to respond
to a cybersecurity incident, and would provide Commission staff with information in its
examination and oversight program in identifying patterns and trends across registrants regarding
such incidents. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate that 236 funds would
be subject to these proposed amendments.
The table below summarizes our PRA initial and ongoing annual burden estimates
associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-6.
 295 On October 26, 2021, the Office of Management and Budget approved without change a revision of the
currently approved information collection estimate for Form N-6.

N. Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6
The proposed amendments to Form N-8B-2 would require a description of any significant
cybersecurity incident that has occurred in a fund’s last two fiscal years. The proposed
disclosure amendments would require that a fund disclose to investors in its registration
statement whether a significant fund cybersecurity incident has or is currently affecting the fund,
depositor, or the fund’s service providers. Form N-8B-2 is used by UITs to initially register
under the Investment Company Act pursuant to section 8 thereof.296 UITs are required to file
Form S-6 in order to register offerings of securities with the Commission under the Securities
Act.297 As a result, UITs file Form N-8B-2 only once when the UIT is initially created and then
use Form S-6 to file all post-effective amendments to their registration statements in order to
update their prospectuses.298
In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Form N-8B-2, we estimated
for Form N-8B-2 a total aggregate annual hour burden of 28 hours, and total aggregate annual
external cost burden of $10,300. 299 We currently estimate for Form S-6 a total aggregate annual
hour burden of 107,359 hours, and an aggregate annual external cost burden estimate of
$68,108,956. 300 Compliance with the disclosure requirements of Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6 is
mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements will not be kept confidential. These
collections of information would help increase the likelihood that funds are prepared to respond
to a cybersecurity incident, and would provide Commission staff with information in its
examination and oversight program in identifying patterns and trends across registrants regarding
such incidents. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate that one filing would
be subject to the proposed amendments under Form N-8B-2 and 1,047 filings would be subject
to the proposed amendments under Form S-6.
301
 296 See Form N-8B-2 [17 CFR 274.12].
297 See Form S-6 [17 CFR 239.16]. Form S-6 is used for registration under the Securities Act of securities of
any UIT registered under the Securities Act on Form N-8B-2.
298 Form S-6 incorporates by reference the disclosure requirements of Form N-8B-2 and allows UITs to meet
the filing and disclosure requirements of the Securities Act.
299 On January 21, 2021, the Office of Management and Budget approved without change a revision of the
currently approved information collection estimate for Form N-8B-2.
300 On July 30, 2020, the Office of Management and Budget approved without change a revision of the
currently approved information collection estimate for Form S-6.
301 The number of unit investment trusts that report being registered under the Investment Company Act on
Form N-8B-2 is 47; however, we believe using the number of filings instead of registrants would form a
more accurate estimate of annual burdens. This estimate is based on the average number of filings made on
Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6 from 2018 to 2020.
The table below summarizes our PRA annual burden estimates associated with the
proposed amendments to Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6.

O. Investment Company Interactive Data
We are proposing to amend Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4, Form N-6,
Form N-8B-2, and Form S-6; rule 485 and rule 497 under the Securities Act; and rule 11 and rule
405 of Regulation S-T to require certain new structured data reporting requirements for funds.
302
Specifically, the proposed amendments would include new structured data requirements that
 302 The Investment Company Interactive Data collection of information do not impose any separate burden
aside from that described in our discussion of the burden estimates for this collection of information.
would require funds to tag the information that the proposal would require funds to include in
their registration statements about significant fund cybersecurity incidents using Inline XBRL.303
The purpose of these information collections is to make information of significant fund
cybersecurity incidents easier for investors to analyze and to help automate regulatory filings and
business information processing, and to improve consistency between all types of funds with
respect to the accessibility of cybersecurity information they provide to the market.
Funds filing registration statements on Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4, and
Form N-6 already submit certain information using Inline XBRL. Based on filing data as of
December 30, 2020, we estimate that 14,702 funds filing registration statements on these forms
would be subject to the proposed interactive data amendments. UITs filing initial registration
statements on Form N-8B-2 and post-effective amendments on Form S-6 are not currently
subject to requirements to submit information in structured form. Because these UITs have not
previously been subject to Inline XBRL requirements, we assume that these funds would
experience additional burdens related to one-time costs associated with becoming familiarized
with Inline XBRL reporting. These costs would include, for example, the acquisition of new
software or the services of consultants, and the training of staff. Based on filing data as of
December 30, 2020, we estimate that 1,048 filings would be subject to these proposed
amendments. In our most recent Paperwork Reduction Act submission for Investment Company
Interactive Data, we estimated a total aggregate annual hour burden of 252,602 hours, and a total
 303 See supra section II.C.4; see also proposed rule 405(b)(2)-(3) of Regulation of S-T; proposed rule
485(c)(3); proposed rule 497(c) and 497(e); proposed General Instruction C.3.(g)(i) and (ii) of Form N-1A;
proposed General Instruction I.2 and 3 of Form N-2; proposed General Instruction C.3(h)(i) and (ii) of
Form N-3; proposed General Instruction C.3(h)(i) and (ii) of Form N-4; proposed General Instruction
C.3(h)(i) and (ii) of Form N-6; proposed General Instruction 2.(l) of Form N-8B-2; and proposed General
Instruction 5 of Form S-6.
aggregate annual external cost burden of $15,350,750.
304 Compliance with the interactive data
requirements is mandatory, and the responses will not be kept confidential.
The table below summarizes our PRA initial and ongoing annual burden estimates
associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4, Form
N-6, Form N-8B-2, and Form S-6, as well as Regulation S-T.

Notes:
1. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a 3-year period.
2. The Commission’s estimates of the relevant wage rates are based on the SIFMA Wage Report. The estimated figures are modified by firm
size, employee benefits, overhead, and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation.
3. This estimate represents the average burden for a filer on Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4, and Form N-6 that is currently subject
to interactive data requirements.
4. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 0.67 ongoing annual burden hours. The estimate of 1 hour is based
on the following calculation: ((1 initial hour /3) + 0.67 additional ongoing burden hours) = 1 hour.
5. We estimate an incremental external cost for filers on Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4, and Form N-6 as they already submit
certain information using Inline XBRL.
 304 On November 9, 2020, the Office of Management and Budget approved without change a revision of the
currently approved information collection estimate for Registered Investment Company Interactive Data.
6. Based on filing data as of December 30, 2020, we estimate 13,248 funds filing on Form N-1A; 786 funds, including BDCs, filing on Form N2; 14 funds filing on Form N-3; 418 funds filing on Form N-4; and 236 funds on Form N-6, totaling 14,702 funds.
7. This estimate represents the average burden for a filer on Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6 that is not currently subject to interactive data
requirements.
8. Includes initial burden estimates annualized over a three-year period, plus 1 ongoing annual burden hour. The estimate of 4 hours is based on
the following calculation: ((9 initial hours /3) + 1 additional ongoing burden hour) = 4 hours.
9. We estimate an external cost for filers on Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6 of $900 to reflect one-time compliance and initial set-up costs. Because
these filers have not been previously been subject to Inline XBRL requirements, we estimate that these funds would experience additional
burdens related to one time-costs associated with becoming familiar with Inline XBRL reporting. These costs would include, for example, the
acquisition of new software or the services of consultants, or the training of staff.
10. The number of unit investment trusts that report being registered under the Investment Company Act on Form N-8B-2 is 47; however, we
believe using the number of filings instead of registrants would form a more accurate estimate of annual burdens. This estimate is therefore based
on the average number of filings made on Form N-8B-2 and Form S-6 from 2018 to 2020.
11. 18,894 hours = (14,702 funds x 1 hour) + (1,048 filings x 4 hours).
12. $6,726,264 internal time cost = (14,702 funds x $356) + (1,048 filings x $1,424).
13. $1,678,300 annual external cost = (14,702 funds x $50) + (1,048 filings x $900).
P. Request for Comment
We request comment on whether these estimates are reasonable. Pursuant to 44 U.S.C.
3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits comments in order to: (1) evaluate whether the proposed
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the
Commission, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) evaluate the
accuracy of the Commission’s estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information;
(3) determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and (4) determine whether there are ways to minimize the burden of
the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of
automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
Persons wishing to submit comments on the collection of information requirements of the
proposed amendments should direct them to the OMB Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, MBX.OMB.OIRA.SEC_desk_officer@omb.eop.gov, and should send a
copy to Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File No. S7-04-22. OMB is required to
make a decision concerning the collections of information between 30 and 60 days after
publication of this release; therefore a comment to OMB is best assured of having its full effect if
OMB receives it within 30 days after publication of this release. Requests for materials
submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to these collections of information should be
in writing, refer to File No. S7-04-22, and be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-2736.
V. INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
The Commission has prepared the following Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
(“IRFA”) in accordance with section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”).305 It relates
to: (1) proposed rule 206(4)-9 under the Advisers Act; (2) proposed rule 38a-2 under the
Investment Company Act; (3) proposed rule 204-6 under the Advisers Act; (4) proposed
amendments to rule 204-3 under the Investment Advisers Act; (5) proposed amendments to rule
204-2 under the Advisers Act; (6) proposed Form ADV-C; (7) proposed amendments to Form
ADV Part 2A; and (8) proposed amendments to Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, Form N-4,
Form N-6, Form N-8B-2, and Form S-6 ( “fund registration forms”) as well as proposed
conforming amendments to rule 485 and rule 497 under the Securities Act and rule 11 and rule
405 of Regulation S-T.
A. Reason For and Objectives of the Proposed Action
The reasons for, and objectives of, the proposed rules are discussed in more detail in
sections I and II, above. The burdens of these requirements on small advisers and funds are
discussed below as well as above in sections III and IV, which discuss the burdens on all
advisers and funds. Sections II through IV also discuss the professional skills that we believe
compliance with the proposed rules form amendments would require.
We are proposing rule 206(4)-9 under the Advisers Act and rule 38a-2 under the
Investment Company Act to require all advisers and funds registered with the Commission to
adopt and implement cybersecurity policies and procedures. Advisers and funds are increasingly
relying on technology systems and networks and face increasing cybersecurity risks. These
 305 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
proposed rules would therefore require all advisers and funds to consider and mitigate
cybersecurity risk to enhance investor protection.
306
We are also proposing rules and amendments, discussed below, regarding recordkeeping,
reporting, and disclosure.307 We are proposing amendments to recordkeeping requirements
under rule 204-2 to: (1) conform the books and records rule to the proposed cybersecurity risk
management rules; (2) help ensure that an investment adviser retains records of all of its
documents related to its cybersecurity risk management; and (3) facilitate the Commission’s
inspection and enforcement capabilities.
We are proposing a new reporting requirement for advisers under proposed rule 204-6
using proposed Form ADV-C. We believe this requirement to provide prompt notice of
significant cybersecurity incidents would help the Commission and its staff in its efforts to
protect investors in connection with cybersecurity incidents by describing the nature and extent
of a particular cybersecurity incident and the firm’s response to the incident. The structured
format of Form ADV-C would enhance the staff’s ability to carry out our risk-based examination
program and other risk assessment and monitoring activities effectively, including assessing
trends in cybersecurity incidents across the industry.
Finally, we are proposing disclosure amendments for advisers and funds as well as
related amendments to the brochure delivery rule, rule 204-3, for advisers. These proposed
amendments are designed to enhance investor protection by ensuring cybersecurity risk or
incident-related information is available to increase understanding and insight into an adviser’s
or fund’s cybersecurity history and risks. For example, given the potential effect that significant
cybersecurity incidents could have on an adviser’s clients, we believe that requiring an adviser to
 306 See proposed rule 206(4)-9 and proposed rule 38a-2; supra section II.A (discussing the cybersecurity
policies and procedures requirements).
307 See proposed rule 204-2 (recordkeeping); proposed rule 204-6, and amendments to rule 204-3 and Form
ADV (reporting); and amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6 (disclosure).
deliver the brochure amendment under the proposed amendments to rule 204-3 promptly would
enhance investor protection by enabling clients to take protective or remedial measures to the
extent appropriate.
We believe that the proposed amendments discussed above would, together, improve the
ability of clients and prospective clients to evaluate and understand relevant cybersecurity risks
and incidents that advisers, funds and their personnel face and their potential effect on the
advisers’ and fund’s services and operations.
1. Proposed Rule 206(4)-9
Proposed rule 206(4)-9 would require policies and procedures that address: (1) risk
assessment; (2) user security and access; (3) information protection; (4) threat and vulnerability
management; and (5) cybersecurity incident response and recovery. The proposed rule would
also require an annual review of these cybersecurity policies and procedures, in which an
adviser: (1) reviews and assesses the design and effectiveness of the cybersecurity policies and
procedures; and (2) prepares a written report that, at a minimum, describes the review,
assessment, and any control tests performed, explains their results, documents any cybersecurity
incident that occurred since the date of the last report, and discusses any material changes to the
policies and procedures since the date of the last report. Proposed rule 206(4)-9 would allow
firms to tailor their cybersecurity policies and procedures to fit the nature and scope of their
business and address their individual cybersecurity risks.
2. Proposed Rule 38a-2
The policies and procedures proposed under rule 38a-2 under the Investment Company
Act would address: (1) risk assessment; (2) user security and access; (3) information protection;
(4) threat and vulnerability management; and (5) cybersecurity incident response and recovery.
The fund’s cybersecurity policies and procedures would be reviewed and assessed at least
annually. In addition, proposed rule 38a-2 would require that a fund maintain a copy of its
cybersecurity policies and procedures that are in effect, or at any time in the last five years were
in effect, in an easily accessible place. The fund would also have to maintain copies for at least
five years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, of: (1) copies of written reports
provided to its board; (2) records documenting the fund’s cybersecurity review; (3) any report of
a significant fund cybersecurity incident provided to the Commission by its adviser that the
proposed rule would require; (4) records documenting the occurrence of any cybersecurity
incident, including records related to any response and recovery from such an incident; and (5)
records documenting a fund’s cybersecurity risk assessment.
3. Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-2
We are proposing related amendments to rule 204-2, the books and records rule, under
the Advisers Act, which sets forth requirements for maintaining, making, and retaining
advertisements. We are proposing to amend the current rule to require advisers to retain (1) a
copy of their cybersecurity policies and procedures formulated pursuant to proposed rule 206(4)-
9 that are in effect, or at any time within the past five years were in effect; (2) a copy of the
adviser’s written report documenting the annual review of its cybersecurity policies and
procedures pursuant to proposed rule 206(4)-9; (3) a copy of any Form ADV-C filed by the
adviser under rule 204-6 in the last five years; (4) records documenting the occurrence of any
cybersecurity incident, as defined in rule 206(4)-9(c), occurring in the last five years, including
records related to any response and recovery from such an incident; and (5) records documenting
any risk assessment conducted pursuant to the cybersecurity policies and procedures required by
rule 206(4)-9(a)(1) in the last five years.
308
4. Proposed Rule 204-6
 308 See proposed rule 204-2(a)(17)(i), (iv) through (vii).
We are proposing a new reporting requirement under proposed rule 204-6. Under the
proposed rule, any adviser registered or required to be registered with the Commission as an
investment adviser would be required to submit proposed Form ADV-C promptly, but in no
event more than 48 hours, after having a reasonable basis to conclude that a significant adviser
cybersecurity incident or a significant fund cybersecurity incident had occurred or is
occurring.309 The proposed rule would also require advisers to amend any previously filed Form
ADV-C promptly, but in no event more than 48 hours after, information reported on the form
becomes materially inaccurate; if new material information about a previously reported incident
is discovered; and after resolving a previously reported incident or closing an internal
investigation pertaining to a previously disclosed incident.
310
5. Form ADV-C
As discussed above, we are proposing a new reporting requirement under proposed rule
204-6 using proposed Form ADV-C. This new Form ADV-C would require an adviser to
provide information regarding a significant cybersecurity incident in a structured format through
a series of check-the-box and fill-in-the-blank questions. Proposed Form ADV-C would require
advisers to report certain information regarding a significant cybersecurity incident in order to
allow the Commission and its staff to understand the nature and extent of the cybersecurity
incident and the adviser’s response to the incident.
6. Proposed Amendments to Form ADV Part 2A
We are proposing amendments to Form ADV that are designed to provide clients and
prospective clients with information regarding cybersecurity risks and incidents that could
materially affect the advisory relationship. The proposed amendments would add a new Item 20
entitled “Cybersecurity Risks and Incidents” to Form ADV’s narrative brochure, or Part 2A. The
 309 See proposed rule 204-6.
310 See id.
brochure, which is publicly available and the primary client-facing disclosure document,
contains information about the investment adviser’s business practices, fees, risks, conflicts of
interest, and disciplinary information. Advisers would be required to, in plain English, describe
cybersecurity risks that could materially affect the advisory services they offer and describe how
they assess, prioritize, and address cybersecurity risks created by the nature and scope of their
business.
The proposed amendments would also require advisers to describe any cybersecurity
incidents that have occurred within the last two years that have significantly disrupted or
degraded the adviser’s ability to maintain critical operations, or has led to the unauthorized
access or use of adviser information, resulting in substantial harm to the adviser or its clients.
The description of each incident, to the extent known, must include the following information:
the entity or entities affected, when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing,
whether any data was stolen, altered, or accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose, the
effect of the incident on the adviser’s operations, and whether the adviser or a service provider
has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.
7. Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-3
Currently, rule 204-3(b) does not require advisers to deliver interim brochure
amendments to existing clients unless the amendment includes certain disciplinary information
in response to Item 9 Part 2A. We are proposing amendments to rule 204-3 that would require
an adviser to deliver interim brochure amendments to existing clients promptly if the adviser
adds disclosure of a cybersecurity incident to its brochure or materially revises information
already disclosed in its brochure about such an incident.311
8. Proposed Amendments to Fund Registration Forms, Rules under the
Securities Act, and Regulation S-T
 311 See proposed rule 204-3(b)(4).
The Commission also is proposing disclosure requirements on funds’ registration
statements to enhance investor protection by requiring that cybersecurity incident-related
information is available to increase understanding in these areas and help ensure that investors
and clients are making informed investment decisions. Our proposal would require a fund to
provide prospective and current investors with disclosure about significant fund cybersecurity
incidents on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6. Our proposal, including the
proposed amendments to the fund registration forms and conforming amendments to rule 485
and rule 497 under the Securities Act, and rule 11 and rule 405 of Regulation S-T, would also
require a fund to tag information about significant fund cybersecurity incidents using Inline
XBRL.

rule 230.497 under the authority set forth in sections 10 and 19 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.
77j and 77s].
C. Small Entities Subject to the Rules and Rule Amendments
In developing these proposals, we have considered their potential effect on small entities
that would be subject to the proposed rules and amendments. The proposed rules and
amendments would affect many, but not all, investment advisers registered with the
Commission, including some small entities.
1. Small Entities Subject to Proposed Rule 206(4)-9, Proposed Rule 204-
6, Proposed Form ADV-C and Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-2,
Rule 204-3, and Form ADV Part 2A
Under Commission rules, for the purposes of the Advisers Act and the RFA, an
investment adviser generally is a small entity if it: (1) has assets under management having a
total value of less than $25 million; (2) did not have total assets of $5 million or more on the last
day of the most recent fiscal year; and (3) does not control, is not controlled by, and is not under
common control with another investment adviser that has assets under management of $25
million or more, or any person (other than a natural person) that had total assets of $5 million or
more on the last day of its most recent fiscal year.312 Our proposed rules and amendments would
not affect most investment advisers that are small entities (“small advisers”) because they are
 312 Advisers Act rule 0-7(a) [17 CFR 275.0-7].
generally registered with one or more state securities authorities and not with the Commission.
Under section 203A of the Advisers Act, most small advisers are prohibited from registering
with the Commission and are regulated by state regulators. Based on IARD data, we estimate
that as of October 31, 2021, approximately 579 SEC-registered advisers are small entities under
the RFA.313
As discussed above in section III.C (the Economic Analysis), the Commission estimates
that based on IARD data as of October 31, 2021, approximately 14,774 investment advisers
would be subject to proposed rule 206(4)-9 and the related proposed amendments to rule 204-2
under the Advisers Act.
All of the approximately 579 SEC-registered advisers that are small entities under the
RFA would be subject to proposed rule 206(4)-9, proposed rule 204-6, and proposed Form
ADV-C as well as the proposed amendments to rule 204-2, rule 204-3 and Form ADV Part 2A.
2. Small Entities Subject to Proposed Rule 38a-2 and Proposed
Amendments to Fund Registration Forms
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, an investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment companies in the
same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end
of its most recent fiscal year (a “small fund”).314 All of the approximately 27 registered openend mutual funds, 6 registered ETFs, 23 registered closed-end funds, 5 UITs, and 9 BDCs
(collectively, 70 funds) that are small entities under the RFA would be subject to proposed rule
 313 Based on SEC-registered investment adviser responses to Items 5.F. and 12 of Form ADV.
314 See rule 0-10(a) under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.0-10(a)].
38a-2 and the proposed amendments to fund registration forms, including the structured data
requirements.
315
D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements
1. Proposed Rule 206(4)-9
Proposed rule 206(4)-9 would impose certain reporting and compliance requirements on
investment advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered investment advisers,
including small entity advisers, would be required to comply with the proposed rule’s policies
and procedures and annual review requirement. The proposed requirements, including
compliance and recordkeeping requirements, are summarized in this IRFA (section V.A. above).
All of these proposed requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in sections I and II, and
these requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in sections III and IV (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens are also discussed in sections II through IV.
There are different factors that would affect whether a smaller adviser incurs costs
relating to these requirements that are higher or lower than the estimates discussed in section
IV.B. For example, we would expect that smaller advisers may not already have cybersecurity
programs that would meet all of the elements that would be required under the proposed
amendments. Also, while we would expect larger advisers to incur higher costs related to this
proposed rule in absolute terms relative to a smaller adviser, we would expect a smaller adviser
 315 This estimate is derived an analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct as well as data reported to the
Commission for the period ending June 2021. We expect few, if any, separate accounts would be treated as
small entities because state law generally treats separate account assets as the property of the sponsoring
insurance company. Rule 0-10(b) under the Investment Company Act aggregates each separate account's
assets with the assets of the sponsoring insurance company, together with assets held in other sponsored
separate accounts.
to find it more costly, per dollar managed, to comply with the proposed requirements because it
would not be able to benefit from a larger adviser’s economies of scale.
As discussed above, there are approximately 579 small advisers currently registered with
us, and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be subject to the
proposed rule 206(4)-9. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in section
IV, the proposed rule 206(4)-9 under the Advisers Act, which would require advisers to prepare
policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risks and incidents, as well as annual review of
those policies and procedures, which would create a new annual burden of approximately 31.67
hours per adviser, or 18,336.93 hours in aggregate for small advisers. We therefore expect the
annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our proposed amendments
would be $7,262,139.36.
316
2. Proposed Rule 38a-2
The proposed amendments contain compliance requirements regarding policies and
procedures, reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements to manage cybersecurity risks and
incidents. All registered investment companies and BDCs, including small entities, would be
required to comply with the proposed rule’s requirements. We discuss the specifics of these
burdens in the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act sections above. The proposed
requirements, including compliance and recordkeeping requirements, are summarized in this
IRFA (section V.A. above). All of these proposed requirements are also discussed in detail in
sections I and II above, and these requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those
that are small entities, are discussed above in sections III and IV (the Economic Analysis and
Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to
meet these specific burdens are also discussed in sections II through IV.
 316 $185,303,708 total cost x (579 small advisers / 14,774 advisers) = $7,262,139.36.
There are different factors that would affect whether a smaller fund incurs costs relating
to these requirements that are higher or lower than the estimates discussed in section IV.C. For
example, we would expect that smaller funds – and more specifically, smaller funds that are not
part of a fund complex – may not have cybersecurity programs that would meet all the elements
that would be required under the proposed amendments. Also, while we would expect larger
funds or funds that are part of a large fund complex to incur higher costs related to this
requirement in absolute terms relative to a smaller fund or a fund that is part of a smaller fund
complex, we would expect a smaller fund to find it more costly, per dollar managed, to comply
with the proposed requirement because it would not be able to benefit from a larger fund
complex’s economies of scale. Notwithstanding the economies of scale experienced by large
versus small funds, we would not expect the costs of compliance associated with the new
requirements to be meaningfully different for small versus large funds.
As discussed above, there are approximately 70 funds that are small entities currently
registered with us, and we estimate that 100 percent of funds registered with us would be subject
to the proposed rule 38a-2. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in
section IV, the proposed rule 38a-2 under the Investment Company Act, which would require
funds to prepare policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risks and incidents, as well as
annual review of those policies and procedures, would create a new annual burden of
approximately 32 hours per fund, or 2,240 hours in aggregate for funds that are small entities.
We therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small funds associated with our
proposed amendments would be $947,170.
317
3. Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-2
 317 70 small funds x $13,531 internal time cost per fund = $947,170.
The proposed amendments to rule 204-2 would impose certain recordkeeping
requirements on investment advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered
investment advisers, including small entity advisers, would be required to comply with the
recordkeeping amendments, which are summarized in this IRFA (section V.C. above). The
proposed amendments are also discussed in detail, above, in sections I and II, and the
requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in sections III and IV (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens are also discussed in sections II through IV.
As discussed above, there are approximately 579 small advisers currently registered with
us, and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be subject to the
proposed amendments to rule 204-2. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis in section IV, the proposed amendments to rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, which
would require advisers to retain certain copies of documents required under proposed rule
206(4)-9 and proposed rule 204-6, would create a new annual burden of approximately 5 hours
per adviser, or 2,895 hours in aggregate for small advisers. We therefore expect the annual
monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our proposed amendments would be
$196,860.
318
4. Proposed Rule 204-6
Proposed rule 204-6 would impose certain reporting and compliance requirements on
investment advisers, including those that are small entities. Specifically, proposed rule 204-6
would require advisers to report significant cybersecurity incidents with the Commission by
filing proposed Form ADV-C. All registered investment advisers, including small entity
 318 $5,023,160 total cost x (579 small advisers / 14,774 advisers) = $196,860.
advisers, would be required to comply with the proposed rule’s reporting requirement by filing
proposed Form ADV-C. The proposed requirements, including reporting and compliance
requirements, are summarized in this IRFA (section V.C. above). All of these proposed
requirements are also discussed in detail, above, in sections I and II, and these requirements and
the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in
sections III and IV (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis,
respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens are also
discussed in sections II through IV.
As discussed above, there are approximately 579 small advisers currently registered with
us, and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be subject to proposed
rule 204-6. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in section IV,
proposed rule 204-6 under the Advisers Act, which would require advisers to report to the
Commission any significant adviser cybersecurity incident or significant fund cybersecurity
incident, would create a new annual burden of approximately 4 hours per adviser, or 2,316 hours
in aggregate for small advisers. We therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to
small advisers associated with our proposed amendments would be $343,926.
319
5. Form ADV-C
Proposed Form ADV-C would impose certain reporting and compliance requirements on
investment advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered investment advisers,
including small entity advisers, would be required to comply with the proposed Form ADV-C’s
requirements. The proposed requirements, including reporting and compliance requirements, are
summarized in this IRFA (section V.C. above). All of these proposed requirements are also
discussed in detail, above, in sections I and II, and these requirements and the burdens on
 319 $8,775,756 total cost x (579 small advisers / 14,774 advisers) = $343,926.
respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in sections III and IV
(the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below. The
professional skills required to meet these specific burdens are also discussed in sections II
through IV.
As discussed above, there are approximately 579 small advisers currently registered with
us, and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be subject to proposed
Form ADV-C. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in section IV,
proposed Form ADV-C, which advisers would file to report any significant cybersecurity
incidents, would create a new annual burden of approximately 1.5 hours per adviser, or 868.5
hours in aggregate for small advisers. We therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost
to small advisers associated with our proposed amendments would be $343,926.
320
6. Proposed Amendments to Form ADV Part 2A
The proposed amendments to Form ADV would impose certain reporting and compliance
requirements on investment advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered
investment advisers, including small entity advisers, would be required to comply with the
proposed amendments to Form ADV Part 2A. The proposed requirements are summarized in
this IRFA (section V.C. above). They are also discussed in detail, above, in sections I and II, and
these requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in sections III and IV (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens are also discussed in sections II through IV.
As discussed above, there are approximately 579 advisers currently registered with us,
and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be subject to the proposed
 320 $8,775,756 total cost x (579 small advisers / 14,774 advisers) = $343,926.
amendments to Form ADV Part 2A. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis in section IV, the proposed amendments, which would require advisers to disclose any
cybersecurity risks and incidents in their brochure, would create a new annual burden of
approximately 16.28 hours per adviser, or 9,426.12 hours in aggregate for small advisers. We
therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated with our
proposed amendments would be $3,185,694.08.
321
7. Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-3
The proposed amendments to rule 204-3 would impose certain reporting and compliance
requirements on investment advisers, including those that are small entities. All registered
investment advisers, including small entity advisers, would be required to comply with the
proposed amendments to rule 204-3. The proposed amendments are summarized in this IRFA
(section V.C. above). They are also discussed in detail, above, in sections I and II, and these
requirements and the burdens on respondents, including those that are small entities, are
discussed above in sections III and IV (the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis, respectively) and below. The professional skills required to meet these specific
burdens are also discussed in sections II through IV.
As discussed above, there are approximately 579 small advisers currently registered with
us, and we estimate that 100 percent of advisers registered with us would be subject to the
proposed amendments to rule 204-3. As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis in section IV, the proposed amendments, which would require advisers to deliver an
amended brochure if the amendment adds disclosure of an event, or materially revises
information already disclosed about an event that involves a cybersecurity incident, would create
a new annual burden of approximately 0.1 hours per adviser, or 57.9 hours in aggregate for small
 321 $81,287,468.54 total cost x (579 small advisers / 14,774 advisers) = $3,185,694.08.
advisers. We therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small advisers associated
with our proposed amendments would be $3,705.60.
322
8. Proposed Amendments to Fund Registration Forms, Rule 485 and
Rule 497 under the Securities Act, and Rule 11 and Rule 405 of
Regulation S-T
The Commission also is proposing enhanced disclosure requirements on registration
statements to enhance investor protection by requiring that cybersecurity incident-related
information is available to increase understanding in these areas and help ensure that investors
and clients can make informed investment decisions. Our proposal would require funds to
provide prospective and current investors with disclosure about significant fund cybersecurity
incidents on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6, as applicable. Our proposal
would also require a fund to tag information about significant fund cybersecurity incidents using
Inline XBRL.
These requirements will impose burdens on all funds, including those that are small
entities. The proposed requirements, including compliance and recordkeeping requirements, are
summarized in this IRFA (section V.A. above). All of these proposed requirements are also
discussed in detail in sections I and II above, and these requirements and the burdens on
respondents, including those that are small entities, are discussed above in sections III and IV
(the Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, respectively) and below. The
professional skills required to meet these specific burdens are also discussed in sections II
through IV.
As discussed above, there are approximately 27 registered open-end mutual funds, 6
registered ETFs, 23 registered closed-end funds, 5 UITs, and 9 BDCs (collectively, 70 funds)
that are small entities under the RFA that would be subject to the proposed amendments to fund
 322 $94,553.6 total cost x (579 small advisers / 14,774 advisers) = $3,705.60.
registration forms.323 As discussed above in our Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis in section
IV, the proposed amendments to disclosure forms, which would require funds to provide
disclosure about significant cybersecurity incidents, would create a new annual burden. We
therefore expect the annual monetized aggregate cost to small funds associated with our
proposed amendments would be $404,060.
324
There are different factors that would affect whether a smaller fund incurs costs related to
this requirement that are on the higher or lower end of the estimated range. For example, while
we would expect larger funds or funds that are part of a large fund complex to incur higher costs
related to this requirement in absolute terms relative to a smaller fund or a fund that is part of a
smaller fund complex, we would expect a smaller fund to find it more costly, per dollar
managed, to comply with the proposed requirement because it would not be able to benefit from
a larger fund complex’s economies of scale. For example, a large firm may have a business unit
that manages cybersecurity for the whole firm, often led by a Chief Information Security Officer.
The costs of that consolidated function, while substantial, would be spread across the whole firm,
leading to economies of scale.
Notwithstanding the economies of scale experienced by large versus small funds, we
would not expect the costs of compliance associated with the new disclosure requirements to be
meaningfully different for small versus large funds. The costs of compliance would likely vary
based on the significant fund cybersecurity incident. For example, a fund, no matter the size,
 323 This estimate is derived an analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct as well as data reported to the
Commission for the period ending June 2021. We expect few, if any, separate accounts would be treated as
small entities because state law generally treats separate account assets as the property of the sponsoring
insurance company. Rule 0-10(b) under the Investment Company Act aggregates each separate account's
assets with the assets of the sponsoring insurance company, together with assets held in other sponsored
separate accounts.
324 $404,060 = (70 funds x $5,340 disclosure form internal time cost) + (65 current XBRL filers x $356
interactive data internal time cost) + (5 new XBRL filers x $1,424 interactive data internal time cost).
would experience more burden if it experienced multiple significant fund cybersecurity
incidents.
We are proposing to require all funds, including small entities, to tag the disclosure about
significant fund cybersecurity incidents in Inline XBRL in accordance with rule 405 of
Regulation S-T and the EDGAR Filer Manual. Large and small funds would both incur the costs
associated with the proposed structured data requirements on a proportional basis. Furthermore,
as noted above, based on our experience implementing tagging requirements that use the XBRL,
we recognize that some funds that would be affected by the proposed requirement, particularly
filers with no Inline XBRL tagging experience, likely would incur initial costs to acquire the
necessary expertise and/or software as well as ongoing costs of tagging required information in
Inline XBRL. The incremental effect of any fixed costs, including ongoing fixed costs, of
complying with the proposed Inline XBRL requirement may be greater for smaller filers.
However, we believe that smaller funds in particular may benefit more from any enhanced
exposure to investors that could result from these proposed requirements. If reporting the
disclosures in a structured data language increases the availability of, or reduces the cost of
collecting and analyzing, key information about funds, smaller funds may benefit from improved
coverage by third-party information providers and data aggregators.
E. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules
1. Proposed Rule 206(4)-9
Investment advisers do not have obligations under the Advisers Act specifically for
policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, their fiduciary
duties require them to take steps to protect client interests, which would include steps to
minimize operational and other risks that could lead to significant business disruptions or a loss
or misuse of client information. Since cybersecurity incidents can lead to significant business
disruptions and loss or misuse of client information, advisers should already be taking steps to
minimize cybersecurity risks in accordance with their fiduciary duties. In addition, rule 206(4)-7
under the Advisers Act already requires advisers to consider their fiduciary and regulatory
obligations and formalize policies and procedures reasonably designed to address them. While
rule 206(4)-7 does not enumerate specific elements that an adviser must include in its
compliance program, advisers may already be assessing the cybersecurity risks created by their
particular circumstances when developing their compliance policies and procedures to address
such risks.
Other Commission rules also require advisers to consider cybersecurity. For example, as
described above, advisers subject to Regulation S-P are required to, among other things, adopt
written policies and procedures that address administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
for the protection of customer records and information.325 In addition, advisers subject to
Regulation S-ID must develop and implement a written identity theft program.326 Nevertheless,
while some advisers may have established effective cybersecurity programs under the existing
regulatory framework, there are no Commission rules that explicitly require firms to adopt and
implement comprehensive cybersecurity policies and procedures.
Recently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a new rule
that would require certain banking organizations in the United States to notify Federal banking
regulators of any cybersecurity incidents within 36 hours of discovering an incident (“bank
cybersecurity rule”).
327 To the extent that a bank or one of its subsidiaries is also registered with
the Commission as an investment adviser, there may be overlapping notification requirements.
 325 See supra footnote 14 and accompanying text.
326 See supra footnote 16.
327 See Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, Computer-Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their
Bank Service Providers (Nov. 18, 2021) [86 FR 66424 (Nov. 23, 2021)].
Additionally, to the extent a firm is required to implement cybersecurity-related policies and
procedures due to its status as a banking organization, if such a firm is also registered with the
Commission, our proposed rules requiring advisers and funds to adopt and implement
cybersecurity policies and procedures may result in some overlapping regulatory requirements
with respect to cybersecurity. However, our proposed amendments related to cybersecurity are
designed to address the cybersecurity risks created as a result of a firm’s operations as an adviser
or fund, which may not be sufficiently addressed under cybersecurity regulations applicable to
banks.
In addition, the FTC recently amended their Standards for Safeguarding Customer
Information that contains a number of modifications to the existing FTC Safeguards Rule with
respect to data security requirements to protect customer financial information.328 We
understand that private funds are generally subject to the FTC Safeguards Rule and to the extent
that a private fund is managed by an adviser that is registered with Commission, our proposed
rule requiring advisers to adopt and implement cybersecurity policies and procedures may result
in some overlapping regulatory requirements with respect to protecting information. However,
our proposed amendments related to cybersecurity are designed to address the cybersecurity risks
created as a result of an adviser’s operations and not specifically those related to the protection of
customer financial information by private funds.
2. Proposed Rule 38a-2
Commission staff have not identified any Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict
with the proposed rule 38a-2.
3. Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-2
 328 See Federal Trade Commission, Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information (Oct. 27, 2021) [86 FR
70272 (Dec. 9, 2021)].
As part of proposed rule 206(4)-9 and proposed rule 204-6, we are proposing
corresponding amendments to the books and records rule. There are no duplicative, overlapping,
or conflicting Federal rules with respect to the proposed amendments to rule 204-2.
4. Proposed Rule 204-6
Proposed rule 204-6 would create a new reporting requirement for advisers to report
significant cybersecurity incidents to the Commission. There are no duplicative, overlapping, or
conflicting Federal rules with respect to proposed rule 204-6.
5. Form ADV-C
Our proposed Form ADV-C would require advisers to provide information regarding a
significant cybersecurity incident through a series of check-the-box and fill-in-the-blank
questions related to the nature and extent of the cybersecurity incident and the adviser’s response
to the incident. The information requested on proposed Form ADV-C would not be duplicative
of, overlap, or conflict with, other information advisers are required to provide on Form ADV.
6. Proposed Amendments to Form ADV
Our proposed new Item 20 in Form ADV Part 2A would require advisers to: (1) describe
any cybersecurity risks that could materially affect the advisory services they offer and how they
assess, prioritize, and address cybersecurity risks; and (2) describe any cybersecurity incidents
that have occurred in the past two fiscal years that have significantly disrupted or degraded the
adviser’s ability to maintain critical operations, or has led to the unauthorized access or use of
adviser information, resulting in substantial harm to the adviser or its clients. These proposed
requirements would not be duplicative of, overlap, or conflict with, other information advisers
are required to provide on Form ADV.
7. Proposed Amendments to Rule 204-3
Our proposed amendments to rule 204-3(b) would require an adviser to promptly deliver
interim brochure amendments to existing clients if the adviser adds disclosure of a cybersecurity
incident to its brochure or materially revises information already disclosed in its brochure about
such an incident. There are no duplicative, overlapping, or conflicting Federal rules with respect
to the proposed amendments to rule 204-3.
8. Proposed Amendments to Fund Registration Forms, Rules under the
Securities Act, and Regulation S-T
Commission staff have not identified any Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict
with the proposed amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-6, N-8B-2, and S-6,
conforming amendments to rule 485 and 497 under the Securities Act, and rule 11 and rule 405
of Regulation S-T.
F. Significant Alternatives
The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs the Commission to consider significant
alternatives that would accomplish our stated objective, while minimizing any significant
economic effect on small entities. We considered the following alternatives for small entities in
relation to our proposal: (1) exempting advisers and funds that are small entities from the
proposed policies and procedures and disclosure requirements, to account for resources available
to small entities; (2) establishing different requirements or frequency, to account for resources
available to small entities; (3) clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying the compliance
requirements under the proposal for small entities; and (4) using design rather than performance
standards.
1. Proposed Rule 206(4)-9
The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse effect on small
entities. We considered the following alternatives for small entities in relation to the proposed
rule 206(4)-9: (1) differing compliance or reporting requirements that take into account the
resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of
compliance and reporting requirements under the proposed rule for such small entities; (3) the
use of design rather than performance standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the
proposed rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.
Regarding the first and fourth alternatives, the Commission believes that establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small advisers, or exempting small advisers
from the proposed rule, or any part thereof, would be inappropriate under these circumstances.
Because the protections of the Advisers Act are intended to apply equally to clients of both large
and small firms, it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Advisers Act to specify
differences for small entities under the proposed rule 206(4)-9 and corresponding changes to rule
204-2. As discussed above, we believe that the proposed rule would result in multiple benefits to
clients. For example, having appropriate cybersecurity policies and procedures in place would
help address any cybersecurity risks and incidents that occur at the adviser and help protect
advisers and their clients from greater risk of harm. We believe that these benefits should apply
to clients of smaller firms as well as larger firms. Establishing different conditions for large and
small advisers even though advisers of every type and size rely on technology systems and
networks and thus face increasing cybersecurity risks would negate these benefits. The
corresponding changes to rule 204-2 are narrowly tailored to address proposed rule 206(4)-9.
Regarding the second alternative, we believe the current proposal is clear and that further
clarification, consolidation, or simplification of the compliance requirements is not necessary.
As discussed above, the proposed rule would require advisers to adopt and implement
cybersecurity policies and procedures that specifically address: (1) risk assessment; (2) user
security and access; (3) information protection; (4) cybersecurity threat and vulnerability
management; and (5) cybersecurity incident response and recovery.329 Advisers would also be
required under the rule to conduct an annual review and assessment of these policies and
 329 See proposed rule 206(4)-9. See also supra section II.A.
procedures. The proposed rule would provide clarity in the existing regulatory framework
regarding cybersecurity and serve as an explicit requirement for firms to adopt and implement
comprehensive cybersecurity programs.
Regarding the third alternative, we determined to use performance standards rather than
design standards. Although the proposed rule requires policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to address a certain number of elements, we do not place certain conditions
or restrictions on how to adopt and implement such policies and procedures. The general
elements are designed to enumerate core areas that firms must address when adopting,
implementing, reassessing and updating their cybersecurity policies and procedures. As
discussed above, given the number and varying characteristics of advisers, we believe firms need
the ability to tailor their cybersecurity policies and procedures based on their individual facts and
circumstances. Proposed rule 206(4)-9 therefore allows advisers to address the general elements
based on the particular cybersecurity risks posed by each adviser’s operations and business
practices. The proposed rule would also provide flexibility for the adviser to determine the
personnel who would implement and oversee the effectiveness of its cybersecurity policies and
procedures.
2. Proposed Rule 38a-2 and Proposed Amendments to the Fund
Registration Forms, Rules under the Securities Act, and Regulation ST
We do not believe that exempting small funds from the provisions of the proposed
amendments would permit us to achieve our stated objectives. We believe funds of all sizes are
subject to cybersecurity risks and may experience cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity
incidents affecting funds also can cause substantial harm to their investors, including by
interfering with the fund’s ability to execute its investment strategy or theft of fund or client data.
If the proposal did not include policies and procedures requirements for small funds, we believe
the lack could raise investor protection concerns for investors in small funds, in that a small fund
would not be subject to the same compliance framework and therefore may not have as robust of
a compliance program as funds that were subject to the required framework. For the same
reasons, we also do not believe that it would be appropriate to establish different cybersecurity
requirements, frequency of disclosure or reporting, or interactive data requirements for small
funds.
We also believe the current proposal is clear and that further clarification, consolidation,
or simplification of the compliance requirements is not necessary. As discussed above, the
proposed rule would require funds to adopt and implement cybersecurity policies and procedures
that specifically address: (1) risk assessment; (2) user security and access; (3) information
protection; (4) cybersecurity threat and vulnerability management; and (5) cybersecurity incident
response and recovery.330 Funds would also be required under the rule to conduct an annual
review and assessment of these policies and procedures. The proposed rule would provide
clarity in the existing regulatory framework regarding cybersecurity and serve as an explicit
requirement for funds to adopt and implement comprehensive cybersecurity programs.
The costs associated with the proposed amendments would vary depending on the fund’s
particular circumstances, and on the number and severity of cybersecurity incidents that a fund
experiences. These variations would result in different burdens on funds’ resources. In
particular, we expect that a fund that has experienced multiple cybersecurity incidents would
bear more expense related to the proposed amendments. To protect investors of both small and
large funds, we believe that it is appropriate for the costs associated with the proposed
amendments to be based on the costs of: (1) implementing a fund’s cybersecurity policies and
procedures; and (2) disclosing any significant fund cybersecurity incident, instead of adjusting
these costs to account for a fund’s size.
 330 See proposed rule 38a-2; see also supra section II.A.
Finally, with respect to the use of design rather than performance standards, the proposed
amendments generally use design standards for all funds subject to the amendments, regardless
of size. Although the proposed rule requires policies and procedures that are reasonably
designed to address a certain number of elements, we do not place certain conditions or
restrictions on how to adopt and implement such policies and procedures. The general elements
are designed to enumerate core areas that firms must address when adopting, implementing,
reassessing and updating their cybersecurity policies and procedures. We believe that providing
funds with the flexibility permitted in the proposal to design the fund’s own individual
cybersecurity policies and procedures is appropriate, because the result would be compliance
activities that are tailored to the particular cybersecurity risks posed by each fund’s operations
and business practices. The proposed rule would provide flexibility for a fund to determine the
personnel who would implement and oversee the effectiveness of its cybersecurity policies and
procedures. In addition, we are aware that cybersecurity threats and risk change to reflect
current technology, and the proposed design standards for funds would permit them to be able to
modify their cybersecurity programs in response to these developments.
3. Proposed Rule 204-6 and Form ADV-C
The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse effect on small
entities. We considered the following alternatives for small entities in relation to the proposed
rule 204-6 and the corresponding proposed Form ADV-C: (1) differing compliance or reporting
requirements that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification,
consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the proposed
rule and Form ADV-C for such small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design
standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the proposed rule and Form ADV-C, or any
part thereof, for such small entities.
Regarding the first and fourth alternatives, the Commission believes that establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small advisers, or exempting small advisers
from the proposed rule, or any part thereof, would be inappropriate under these circumstances.
Because the protections of the Advisers Act are intended to apply equally to clients of both large
and small firms, it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Advisers Act to specify
differences for small entities under proposed rule 204-6 and proposed Form ADV-C, as well as
corresponding changes to rule 204-2. As discussed above, we believe that the proposed rule and
Form ADV-C would result in multiple benefits to clients. For example, having this reporting
would help us in our efforts to protect investors in connection with cybersecurity incidents by
providing prompt notice of these incidents. It would also help us better assess the potential
effect of the cybersecurity incident on the adviser and its covered clients and whether there is the
potential for client and investor harm. We believe that these benefits should apply to clients of
smaller firms as well as larger firms. As mentioned above, establishing different conditions for
large and small advisers even though advisers of every type and size rely on technology systems
and networks and thus face increasing cybersecurity risks would negate these benefits.
Regarding the second alternative, we believe the current proposal for rule 204-6 and
Form ADV-C is clear and that further clarification, consolidation, or simplification of the
compliance requirements is not necessary. As discussed above, proposed rule 204-6 would
require advisers to report to the Commission through Form ADV-C, any significant
cybersecurity incidents within 48 hours after having a reasonable basis to conclude that any such
incident has occurred.331 These proposals would provide a new, clear opportunity in the existing
regulatory framework for reporting to the Commission with respect to significant cybersecurity
incidents.
 331 See proposed rule 204-6; see also supra section II.B.
Regarding the third alternative, we determined to use a combination of performance and
design standards. Our proposal requires all advisers, including small advisers, to report using
Form ADV-C promptly, but in no event more than 48 hours after, having a reasonable basis to
believe a significant cybersecurity incident has occurred. Once the adviser makes the
determination that an incident would meet the definition of a significant cybersecurity incident, it
is required to report on Form ADV-C within 48 hours. We believe this requirement should apply
to all advisers, regardless of size, given that all types of advisers are susceptible to cybersecurity
incidents, and obtaining such information from all advisers would help to ensure that the
Commission has accurate and timely information with respect to adviser and fund cybersecurity
incidents to better allocate resources when evaluating and responding to these incidents.
We also considered an alternative that would have increased the scope of the proposed
rule’s performance standards and removed the 48-hour threshold, solely relying on the word
“promptly.” However, we believe providing a specific time period would provide advisers,
including small advisers, with the opportunity to confirm its determination and prepare the report
while still providing the Commission with timely notice about the incident.
1. Proposed Amendments to Form ADV and Rule 204-3
The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse effect on small
entities. We considered the following alternatives for small entities in relation to the proposed
amendments to Form ADV and rule 204-3: (1) differing compliance or reporting requirements
that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation,
or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the proposed amendments for
such small entities; (3) the use of design rather than performance standards; and (4) an
exemption from coverage of the proposed amendments, or any part thereof, for such small
entities.
Regarding the first and fourth alternatives, the Commission believes that establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small advisers, or exempting small advisers
from the proposed amendments, or any part thereof, would be inappropriate under these
circumstances. Because the protections of the Advisers Act are intended to apply equally to
clients of both large and small firms, it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Advisers
Act to specify differences for small entities under the proposed amendments to Form ADV and
rule 204-3. As discussed above, we believe that the proposed amendments would result in
multiple benefits to clients. For example, the proposed amendments to Form ADV would
improve the ability of clients and prospective clients to evaluate and understand relevant
cybersecurity risks and incidents that advisers and their personnel face and their potential effect
on the advisers’ services. Also, requiring advisers to deliver interim brochure amendments to
existing clients promptly if the adviser adds or materially revises disclosure of a cybersecurity
incident, would enhance investor protection by enabling clients to take protective or remedial
measures as appropriate. Clients and investors may also be able to determine whether their
engagement of an adviser remains appropriate and consistent with their investment objectives
better. We believe that these benefits should apply to clients of smaller firms as well as larger
firms. Establishing different conditions for large and small advisers even though all advisers,
regardless of type and size, face cybersecurity risks would negate these benefits.
Regarding the second alternative, we believe the current proposed amendments are clear
and that further clarification, consolidation, or simplification of the compliance requirements is
not necessary. As discussed above, the proposed amendments to Form ADV would require
advisers to disclose information regarding cybersecurity risks that could materially affect the
advisory relationship.
332 The proposed amendments to rule 204-3 would also require prompt
 332 See supra section II.C.
delivery of interim brochure supplements if an adviser adds or materially revises disclosure
related to a cybersecurity incident.333 The proposed amendments to Form ADV would provide
for advisers to present clear and meaningful cybersecurity disclosure to their clients and
prospective clients, and the proposed amendments to rule 204-3 would assist in providing clients
updated cybersecurity disclosures.
Regarding the third alternative, we determined to use a mix of performance and design
standards, regardless of size, with respect to the proposed amendments. We believe the
amendments already appropriately use performance rather than design standards in many
instances. The proposed amendments to Form ADV do not contain any specific limitations or
restrictions on the disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents. As discussed above, given the
number and varying types of advisers, as well as the types of cybersecurity risks and incidents
that may be present or occur at a particular adviser, respectively, we believe firms need the
ability to tailor their disclosures according to their own circumstances. The proposed
amendments to rule 204-3 do not change the performance standard already present in rule 204-3.
Advisers may, with client consent, deliver their brochures and supplements, along with any
updates, to clients electronically.334 Advisers may also incorporate their supplements into the
brochure or provide them separately.
G. Solicitation of Comments
We encourage written comments on the matters discussed in this IRFA. We solicit
comment on the number of small entities subject to the proposed rule 206(4)-9, proposed rule
38a-2, proposed rule 204-6, proposed Form ADV-C, and proposed amendments to rule 204-2,
rule 204-3, Form ADV, and the fund registration forms. We also solicit comment on the

potential effects discussed in this analysis; and whether this proposal could have an effect on
small entities that has not been considered. We request that commenters describe the nature of
any effect on small entities and provide empirical data to support the extent of such effect.
VI. CONSIDERATION OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, or
“SBREFA,”773 we must advise OMB whether a proposed regulation constitutes a “major” rule.
Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it results in or is likely to result
in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or
prices for consumers or individual industries; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,
investment or innovation. We request comment on the potential effect of the proposed
amendments on the U.S. economy on an annual basis; any potential increase in costs or prices for
consumers or individual industries; and any potential effect on competition, investment or
innovation. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for
their views to the extent possible.

Text of Proposed Rules and Rule and Form Amendments
For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Commission is proposing to amend title 17,
chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:
PART 230 – GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
1. The authority citation for part 230 continues to read, in part, as follows:
Authority: 15 U.S.C. 77b, 77b note, 77c, 77d, 77f, 77g, 77h, 77j, 77r, 77s, 77z-3, 77sss,
78c, 78d, 78j, 78l, 78m, 78n, 78o, 78o-7 note, 78t, 78w, 78ll(d), 78mm, 80a-8, 80a-24, 80a-28,
80a-29, 80a-30, and 80a-37, and Pub. L. 112-106, sec. 201(a), sec. 401, 126 Stat. 313 (2012),
unless otherwise noted.
* * * * *
Sections 230.400 to 230.499 issued under secs. 6, 8, 10, 19, 48 Stat. 78, 79, 81, and 85, as
amended (15 U.S.C. 77f, 77h, 77j, 77s).
* * * * *
2. Amend §230.485 by revising paragraph (c)(3) to read as follows:
§230.485 Effective date of post-effective amendments filed by certain registered investment
companies.
* * * * *
(c) * * *
(3) A registrant's ability to file a post-effective amendment, other than an amendment
filed solely for purposes of submitting an Interactive Data File, under paragraph (b) of this
section is automatically suspended if a registrant fails to submit any Interactive Data File (as
defined in § 232.11 of this chapter) required by the Form on which the registrant is filing the
post-effective amendment. A suspension under this paragraph (c)(3) shall become effective at
such time as the registrant fails to submit an Interactive Data File as required by the relevant
